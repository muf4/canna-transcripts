cheers dude you are welcome to read my

65
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:11,389
name out loud so this message comes from

66
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,000
our friend John and it goes a lot like

67
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:16,669
this a couple of things I heard you call

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,020
up for music on podcast 400 and I will

69
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,000
see what I can do for you

70
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,860
I checked out fish to get an idea of

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,270
what you like and I will see what I can

72
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,760
come up with hey that's pretty cool of

73
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,250
you man don't try to make too much of a

74
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,810
fishy sound for an intro I would prefer

75
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,669
something kind of reggae kind of

76
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,319
up-tempo reggae kind of kicks in the

77
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,759
door remember how we used to start it

78
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,379
with that beat that would just kick off

79
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,549
right away something that Kicks down the

80
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,930
door and says hey it's time for a

81
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,820
podcast that's what I would love

82
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,860
something kind of reggae like if you

83
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,500
made a fish type song I will certainly

84
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,020
play it that sounds great so yes I did

85
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,669
ask for music on episode 400 I did not

86
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,990
get a new theme song if anybody out

87
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,299
there would like to make a theme song

88
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,070
like I said something reggae something

89
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,020
that kicks in the door something that

90
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,789
has not been posted to YouTube before

91
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,950
because if you have already posted it to

92
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:02,299
YouTube YouTube will flag me when I post

93
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,069
it and say that I am stealing your

94
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,750
content so it's got to be fresh original

95
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,239
material if you'd like me to play it on

96
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,919
the show so so far John you are off to a

97
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,570
great start you are making me an intro

98
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,250
that probably sounds like fish and I

99
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,349
appreciate that I will play it on the

100
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,509
show it will make a great vibe there is

101
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:19,358
more to the message it says a few grow

102
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:22,909
questions and this is where it gets fun

103
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,560
question number a budget grows how do I

104
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,600
control humidity when the lights go out

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,920
when it is time for the girls to go to

106
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,140
bed

107
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,730
there is always a huge humidity spike

108
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,629
which is difficult to control on a

109
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:36,300
budget I have a cheap 100 pound not the

110
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:39,009
weight but the price 100 pound

111
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,720
dehumidifier which removes moisture from

112
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:43,000
the air and is fine whilst the lights

113
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,240
are on but fails to control the humidity

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,519
during darkness humidity spikes it would

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,530
be worse without the dehumidifier but it

116
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,409
struggles to get the RH down to desired

117
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:55,449
levels during darkness is this a fact of

118
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,240
life for all gardeners unless you have

119
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:00,279
access to serious equipment I can't

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,590
afford a better dehumidifier or the

121
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,019
power to run it any tips for a novice

122
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:07,719
grower on a brutal budget so this

123
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:08,919
listener has a very common problem when

124
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,870
the lights go out in their grow

125
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,910
environment the humidity spikes

126
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,470
drastically and this person is getting

127
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,420
concerned that it may cause a problem

128
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,640
and their grow and they need a way to

129
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,439
control that humidity without spending a

130
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,029
ton of money perhaps without spending

131
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,560
any money they said that the budget is

132
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:26,019
low they cannot afford a better

133
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,759
dehumidifier or even the power to run it

134
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:30,339
so let's talk about things that we could

135
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,500
do things that need to be done the first

136
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:34,329
thing I would suggest is maybe turn on

137
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,829
the dehumidifier earlier I don't know

138
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:37,269
when you were starting that dehumidifier

139
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:39,250
so I don't know when it is starting to

140
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:40,689
remove the moisture from the air your

141
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,939
problem is happening right when the

142
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:44,920
lights go off maybe if we start turning

143
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,810
on the dehumidifier an hour before the

144
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,480
lights go off we can start prepping the

145
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,589
environment and removing some of the air

146
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,759
beforehand now what's gonna happen is

147
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:53,619
the lights are gonna go off and that

148
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,909
plants are gonna start respiring and

149
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,399
transpiring and they're gonna let out

150
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,230
moisture but maybe we can remove enough

151
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,969
moisture from the air before the lights

152
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,000
go off to where when the lights do go

153
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,440
off it is not such a drastic swing so

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,899
maybe when the lights are on you're

155
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,969
running about 50% humidity maybe 40%

156
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:12,399
humidity when the lights go off you're

157
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,350
probably peaking up to 60 70 maybe 80%

158
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,239
humidity I don't know your environment

159
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,060
maybe if we start turning on that

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,400
dehumidifier one maybe two hours before

161
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,160
lights go off we can reduce the amount

162
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,139
of moisture in that air low enough to

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,790
compensate for that giant swing when it

164
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:29,800
does happen when the lights go off that

165
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,689
is going to be my first plan of attack

166
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,730
try to get ahead of the humidity problem

167
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,410
before it happens we know it's going to

168
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,180
happen we know when it's going to happen

169
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,070
maybe we can remove moisture from the

170
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,150
air before that time comes and give

171
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,189
ourselves a head start

172
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,409
now I don't know how larger gross space

173
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,790
is I don't have a lot of details on your

174
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,139
grow environment I don't know how many

175
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,879
plants are in there I don't know what

176
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,110
size containers those plants are in I

177
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,579
don't know how much moisture you are

178
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,889
adding to the room or how frequently

179
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:56,050
that is happening so with the small

180
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,449
amount of information I have got I don't

181
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,430
have a lot to work with no matter what

182
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,530
size that environment is I think you

183
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,930
need to install some sort of extraction

184
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:06,728
fan to remove the humidity from that

185
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,620
environment and send it somewhere else

186
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:10,839
if you've got a small grow tent

187
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,090
something like maybe a four inch

188
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,369
extraction fan maybe a computer fan up

189
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:17,649
in the top corner would work that may be

190
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,090
efficient anything to help pull some of

191
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,250
that stale humid air out of that

192
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:23,439
environment would be beneficial now if

193
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,839
you have something larger you may need a

194
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,370
larger extraction fan I don't know your

195
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,810
environment I don't know the size of

196
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,030
your space I don't know how much

197
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,220
moisture is in there but your best bet

198
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:35,500
next to another dehumidifier would be

199
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,930
some way of extracting that humid air

200
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,879
from that room something like a squirrel

201
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,120
cage blower or something like a vortex

202
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,500
fan or something like a can fan

203
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,000
something to move that old air out of

204
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,949
the room I keep saying I don't know how

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,598
large your environment is the size of

206
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,668
your gross space is going to determine

207
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,860
how much air you need to move out of

208
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:55,509
that room now when you go sucking air

209
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,160
out of the room you start thinking about

210
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,959
odor that's when you start thinking

211
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,090
about a carbon filter which is when this

212
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,589
starts to get expensive I don't know if

213
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,598
you've got neighbors or people that you

214
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:06,638
need to conceal the aroma from but if

215
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,439
you were extracting your odor outside of

216
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,660
your home or just somewhere other people

217
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:12,430
may come in contact with that air you

218
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,110
need to clean the aroma out of that air

219
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,590
so you will need a carbon filter I've

220
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,479
done a full Episode on carbon filters

221
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:21,098
episode number 430 is all about a carbon

222
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,098
filter and where to place that filter

223
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:26,228
that lesson would apply greatly to your

224
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:28,089
question here now I know you were on a

225
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:30,129
budget but this is what I would do if

226
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:32,978
this were possible I would get the

227
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:35,049
appropriate size extraction fan for your

228
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,900
grow environment I would try to hang

229
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,728
that extraction fan in the top center of

230
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:41,500
my flowering room if you can get it as

231
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,139
high as possible and in the dead center

232
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,909
that is your best bet I understand that

233
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:47,528
ceiling space is limited I understand

234
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:49,179
that height is limited and I understand

235
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,980
that things are heavy so we can't always

236
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:53,519
mount things to the ceiling but that is

237
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,839
the best place for this extraction fan

238
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,579
so I would hang that fan from the

239
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,279
ceiling then I would run ducting from

240
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,320
that ceiling to the wall then I would

241
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,939
cut the appropriate size hole in the

242
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,950
wall and I would run that ducting

243
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,209
through the wall now I don't know where

244
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,740
it needs to go once it gets out of that

245
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,539
room do you need to run it even further

246
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,490
down another hallway is that going

247
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,259
outside at that point that's a whole

248
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,669
another thing to think about but now you

249
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,139
were sucking air through that blower

250
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:17,969
you're blowing it down the ducting and

251
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,708
it is going out of your grow environment

252
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,778
you're going to remove heat and you are

253
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,909
going to remove humidity by doing so at

254
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:26,278
the same time you are going to be

255
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:28,079
blasting odoriferous cannabis scented

256
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,059
air straight through that ducting

257
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,278
wherever that air ends up so that is

258
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:34,379
when I recommend a carbon filter I would

259
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,539
recommend you hang a carbon filter then

260
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,429
your blower vineyard ducting out of the

261
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,809
grow environment now I do understand

262
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:41,489
that earlier you said you don't have a

263
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:43,949
budget to work with you said you cannot

264
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,539
afford a better dehumidifier and you

265
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,850
said you cannot afford the power to run

266
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,649
it if you can't afford a big expensive

267
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,450
blower and a carbon filter maybe

268
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,190
something like a small computer fan

269
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,110
anything that will just blow some air

270
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,270
out of that room from the top would be

271
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,980
helpful now I understand that buying a

272
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:01,289
blower and buying a carbon filter and

273
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,789
buying ducting does cost money and I

274
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:05,338
really don't have a more affordable

275
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:07,439
solution that humid air either needs to

276
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,600
be sucked out or blown out of that room

277
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,670
or treated by the dehumidifier those are

278
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,310
basically your two options other things

279
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:15,838
we can't think about are where is excess

280
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,149
water coming from do you have any

281
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,160
standing water in that room after you

282
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,019
water is there water left in your catch

283
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,969
tray or your runoff saucer or whatever

284
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,919
you're using is there water left in the

285
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,329
room maybe you can use a shot back and

286
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,309
suck that up and get that out of the

287
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:31,379
room another thing that will help in

288
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:33,479
this may sound crazy is a little bit of

289
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,490
defoliation if those leaves aren't there

290
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,740
they can't let out water so that may be

291
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,659
another way to help combat your humidity

292
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,519
issue so hopefully one of those options

293
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,409
work maybe a combination of those things

294
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,750
will help you out I'm sorry I don't have

295
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,610
a really easy solution that will fix

296
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,289
this that could be free it sounds like

297
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,300
you may have to spend a few bucks on

298
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:53,159
this and if you do go with the blower

299
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,769
route I highly recommend that carbon

300
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:58,019
filter because a carbon filter a blower

301
00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:00,149
and some ducting is much more affordable

302
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,338
than a court case for an illegal grow

303
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,139
all right there are a lot of questions

304
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,010
in this email so let's keep moving

305
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,860
question number B says

306
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:10,899
low stress training when should it start

307
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,779
is there a method to the madness are

308
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:16,029
scrog nets worth the hassle if LST has

309
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:18,699
been done properly and is there anything

310
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:21,639
you should not do when low stress

311
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,040
training that's a lot to think about you

312
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,629
can start LST as soon as those plants

313
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:27,579
are thick enough and robust enough to

314
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,740
handle being cracked and being twisted

315
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,509
being manipulated if you feel like the

316
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,159
plant can take it go for it

317
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:34,960
usually I would wait for them to get

318
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,759
about the thickness of a big pen or a

319
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,590
pencil before I start cracking on them

320
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,210
but you can start as soon as you feel

321
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,879
like they can take a little bit of abuse

322
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,860
and that is going to be strain and maybe

323
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,960
phenotype specific so be careful with

324
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,269
that now there is a method to the

325
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,800
madness I'm not sure what type of low

326
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,360
stress training you were doing there are

327
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,370
very many different options that you can

328
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,230
do I like to grab the plant and give it

329
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,840
a little twist and pop it I like to do

330
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:01,180
that a lot the method to that is to grab

331
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,889
it kind of close to the stalk put your

332
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,599
other hand above it and twist and just

333
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,039
pop you'll hear it pop and then I do

334
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,019
like that thing we used to do in school

335
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,730
and we tried to decide who goes first in

336
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,139
baseball where you put your hand on the

337
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,879
bat and the next guy puts his hand above

338
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:14,710
yours the next guy puts his hand above

339
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,509
yours that's how I measure my crack

340
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,250
distance I go crack and I put my hand

341
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:19,899
above it crack put my hand above it

342
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,120
crack and I just work my way up the stem

343
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:24,279
that is my method to that madness I

344
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,019
start at the main stalk of the plant and

345
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,120
I go all the way up until it gets kind

346
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,460
of skinny until I'm up to the top then I

347
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,110
do that to every single branch starting

348
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,940
at the lowest branch and work my way up

349
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,830
that branch then to the next branch will

350
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,810
work my way up I popped the [ __ ] out of

351
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,970
those plants that is the method to my

352
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:41,979
madness again there are several

353
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,600
different methods and approaches to low

354
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,519
stress training I'm not sure what you're

355
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,500
doing as long as you have a goal in mind

356
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,779
and you were observing what is happening

357
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,159
there is a method to your madness don't

358
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:52,689
just go in there and do a bunch of

359
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:54,429
different [ __ ] and don't pay attention

360
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,440
if you're gonna do something to plant a

361
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:58,509
and something to plant B have a reason

362
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,190
make a note of what you did why you did

363
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:01,629
it in which plant you did it to and then

364
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,270
there is a method to your madness

365
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:06,820
the next question is our scrog nets

366
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:09,819
worth it if the LST is done correctly

367
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,110
yes I really like a sprog net I feel

368
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,640
like when the top buds start getting

369
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,860
kind of heavy and floppy if you've got

370
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,149
one two maybe even three layers of scrog

371
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,250
Nets you don't need to get in there with

372
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:19,649
a bunch of sticks hopefully your buds

373
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,629
are going to get so big

374
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:23,999
fat that your branches can't support

375
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,800
them even after all of that low stress

376
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:27,269
training you're still gonna get big fat

377
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,969
giant buds that those sticks are not

378
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:32,220
ready for in any commercial environment

379
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,589
which I am responsible for I always run

380
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,149
a screen of green system I usually set

381
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:38,160
up one screen to kind of spread the

382
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,869
plants apart a little bit the second

383
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,249
screen is to kind of guide them to get

384
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:42,720
them going straight up to put them in

385
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:44,699
the position where I want the branches

386
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,559
the third one is to support those big

387
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:49,588
gigantic floppy buds that will happen

388
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:51,058
around week five six seven and then

389
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,829
continue all the way through week nine

390
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:54,088
or ten whenever we harvest they're just

391
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:55,649
gonna get bigger they're gonna get

392
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:57,389
floppier you don't want to get in there

393
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,639
with a bunch of sticks and bamboo sticks

394
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:01,499
and tomato cages and [ __ ] I think those

395
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,119
screens really are worth their weight in

396
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:04,949
gold and they're definitely worth the

397
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:06,600
hassle once you get good at hanging them

398
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:08,909
up they're not that hard it almost

399
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,439
becomes as easy as making a bed once you

400
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:12,088
learn how to do it in a commercial

401
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:14,248
environment I like to find another guy

402
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:15,689
that's as tall as myself I'm six five if

403
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:17,790
I can find another guy that's like six

404
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:20,009
foot or six too we can hang up trellis

405
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:22,740
all day no problem it is super fast and

406
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:25,139
super easy then to wrap up question B he

407
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,318
asks is there anything you would not do

408
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,509
when low stress training really the only

409
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:32,729
way to learn what not to do is to do

410
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:34,318
some [ __ ] and see it go wrong that is

411
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,409
the best way to learn anything in a

412
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:39,058
garden so try some [ __ ] experiment when

413
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,370
you try three or four things and one or

414
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:43,740
two of them absolutely fail those are

415
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,149
the things not to do again I really

416
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,289
don't know what else to tell you not to

417
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:47,730
do because I don't know what you're

418
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,349
planning I don't see your devious little

419
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,028
mind applauding what's gonna happen in

420
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,620
that grow so I don't know what to tell

421
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:55,708
you not to do what I can tell you is to

422
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,110
think twice before you do anything you

423
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,998
can always cut later but you can't put

424
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,860
[ __ ] back so think about it if you're

425
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,449
gonna do something crazy look at the

426
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,639
plants think about what you're gonna do

427
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:08,128
think to yourself why am I going to do

428
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,110
that what is my desired outcome what is

429
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:11,909
it going to look like immediately after

430
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,949
I do that what is it gonna look like in

431
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:15,868
12 hours after I do that what's it gonna

432
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:18,058
look like in three days what will it be

433
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:20,189
like in two weeks after I do this how is

434
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:22,919
this going to affect my final outcome of

435
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:25,019
my finished product then before you do

436
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,870
that crazy [ __ ] you're thinking about go

437
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,578
smoke a joint go for a walk go play on

438
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,259
the internet then come back and rethink

439
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:32,799
your [ __ ] and see if it is something you

440
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,600
really want to do because

441
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,389
like I said a moment ago you can always

442
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,970
cut more off but you can't glue leaves

443
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:42,189
or plant parts back on so think about

444
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,080
everything twice before you're gonna do

445
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,570
it smoke a joint think about it again

446
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,820
maybe ask a friend maybe send me an

447
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,278
email maybe go look on a forum get an

448
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,528
educated decision before you do anything

449
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,328
crazy so that is what I would say not to

450
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:57,129
do don't do anything ridiculous without

451
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:58,989
thoroughly thoroughly thinking it

452
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:00,549
through all right we are ripping right

453
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,039
through this message let's work on

454
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:05,469
question numbers see question number C

455
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,929
says best seed company in the UK or

456
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,120

00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:18,429
a difficulty sourcing them in the UK or

460

Europe I understand that frustration I

461
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:21,759
get messages like this every day that

462
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:24,099
people overseas would like to get their

463
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,750
hands on some I read genetics seeds the

464
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,050

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,970
D question D on this email goes like

490
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:30,279
this upgrade so if you start with a one

491
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,980
meter square budget tent a 400 watt

492
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,079
light a small dehumidifier and a 4-inch

493
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,240
extractor fan at some point you will

494
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,799
want to upgrade now you've just given me

495
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,940
a really good idea of your grow I wish

496
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,220
you would have started with that I would

497
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,990
have had more accurate better more clear

498
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,600
advice but this is where we are now so

499
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,058
let's keep going the question is

500
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:51,519
can you give me any advice on upgrading

501
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:53,769
as many upgrades I suspect will only

502
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,569
give you tiny gains and maybe rather

503
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:58,058
pointless unless you are upping your

504
00:17:55,569 --> 00:18:00,460
game altogether to a much larger grow

505
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:03,548
with commercial aspirations are there

506
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,528
any big gains for small grows then he

507
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:07,418
says by the way I appreciate that the

508
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:09,849
best gains are achieved by knowing and

509
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,559
loving your plants yes absolutely

510
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:13,569
understanding the plants developing a

511
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:15,908
relationship with each cultivar is the

512
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:18,038
best way to improve and grow top notch

513
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:19,629
product but let's look at the equipment

514
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:22,000
you've already got you've got a decent

515
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:23,439
light you have got a small dehumidifier

516
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,659
it sounds like you need a larger

517
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,759
dehumidifier already is the thing you

518
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:29,889
need to step up you've got a 4-inch

519
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,628
extractor fan maybe you need a better

520
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:33,819
extractor fan those are the two things

521
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:34,959
for you to focus on right now it says at

522
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,849
some point you're gonna want to upgrade

523
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,009
to a better light and a better

524
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:41,288
dehumidifier and a better tint not

525
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:43,690
necessarily a larger tint but you like

526
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:45,849
advice on that I generally start with

527
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,129
lighting I like to buy the highest

528
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:51,189
quality light I can afford and the most

529
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:53,648
efficient light for my space in today's

530
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,870
modern market grow lights are constantly

531
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:57,729
changing so I would try to find the most

532
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:59,678
efficient most effective light that I

533
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,548
can afford for that space that's where I

534
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,830
would start

535
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:04,839
then I would work on cooling that area

536
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:07,148
and controlling the environment I would

537
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,829
work on dehumidification and removing

538
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:10,750
stale hot air out of there so you're

539
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:12,308
going to need that extractor fan and a

540
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,648
carbon filter that's the next thing I

541
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:16,480
would work on then I would work on

542
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:18,758
cooling the environment in which that

543
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,528
tent is in I wouldn't necessarily cool

544
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,720
the inside of the tent I would cool the

545
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:25,028
room which the tent is living in and

546
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,339
that air would then cycle into that tent

547
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:29,109
so I would start with lighting then I

548
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:31,089
would work on air flow then I would

549
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:32,769
focus on cooling the tent now that we've

550
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:34,959
got our light and our environment dialed

551
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:36,788
in it is time to work on automation

552
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,379
the first step to automation is knowing

553
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,878
what is going on in the grow room so

554
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,528
you'll need something that can monitor

555
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:44,019
your environment something that can pay

556
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:46,450
attention to temperature and humidity at

557
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:48,849
all times then I like to have some sort

558
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,009
of a device that can react to those

559
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:52,750
inputs maybe I've got some sort of a

560
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,849
device that tells me hey Rasta Jeff it

561
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,679
is now too humid in your grow room at

562
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:59,490
that point I want something to trigger

563
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,830
on to reduce that humidity a good

564
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,558
example would be a smart be unit you can

565
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:06,379
plug a smart be stinger into any wall

566
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,329
outlet then you can plug your

567
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,250
dehumidifier into that smart B you plug

568
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:13,500
it into spot number one you assign

569
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,869
number one to dehumidification then you

570
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,910
tell your smart B sensor hey I want it

571
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:19,799
to be fifty percent humidity in this

572
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,570
room if it gets higher than that turn on

573
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,460
that dehumidifier and it will do that

574
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:26,189
for you the monitor will pay attention

575
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,539
as soon as it hits 52 percent humidity

576
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,429
in that room it'll say hey guess what

577
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,409
rhasta Jeff wants it fifty percent I

578
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,660
need to turn on slot number a on that

579
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,429
stinger your dehumidifier will fire up

580
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,130
you will suck out the humidity in that

581
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:40,170
room you can also put an extraction fan

582
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,059
on that same stinger throw it on slot

583
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,250
number two put it on dehumidification

584
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:46,259
that way when it gets too humid your

585
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,049
dehumidifier comes on and your

586
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:51,029
extraction fan comes on and now you are

587
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:52,470
dehumidifier that room so once you've

588
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:54,450
got good equipment I like to add

589
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,279
monitors followed by automation

590
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,769
I think monitors and automation make

591
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,289
things very easy cannabis plants love

592
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:03,058
consistency and if you automate simple

593
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,039
things like watering and dehumidifier

594
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:06,839
that saves you a lot of time for doing

595
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,460
other things in the grow like the low

596
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:10,709
stress training like the popping and

597
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,179
twisting like defoliating like scouting

598
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,340
for bugs like all of the other things

599
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:16,380
they get pushed aside because we're too

600
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,269
busy doing things we could have and

601
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,800
should have automated so I would start

602
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:21,450
with the lights then I would work on

603
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,279
climate control and air conditioning

604
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,470
then I would go to monitoring then I

605
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,359
would work on automation then if you

606
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,120
really want to step it up it is time to

607
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,149
start adding co2 to your grow room you

608
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,250
want to supplement co2 ambient co2 in

609
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,550
most environments on earth is around 400

610
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:41,279
ppm our cannabis plants can thrive in

611
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:43,200
much higher levels of co2 they will grow

612
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,420
more rapidly it will grow with more

613
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,630
vigor it will become larger with less

614
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,308
time so supplementing augmenting co2 in

615
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,559
your grow environment is a great way to

616
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:54,990
improve your grow room you will increase

617
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,879
the harvest way you will decrease grow

618
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,400
time and you will increase overall

619
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,140
quality of your finished product now

620
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,820
that is the equipment you also need to

621
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,679
make sure that you are feeding the best

622
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,139
nutrients you can feed you need to make

623
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:11,790
sure that each feed is dialed in also I

624
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:13,740
suggest good pH pins and ec meters and I

625
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,899
also recommend you calibrate those

626
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,880
vices regularly those devices don't do

627
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,820
you any good if they are not calibrated

628
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,559
properly so that is a list of options

629
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,839
and things you can do to upgrade your

630
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,849
grow room keep in mind that grow room

631
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,009
equipment is constantly changing and

632
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:31,678
evolving especially with legalization

633
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:33,390
people are able to research more people

634
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,790
are able to advertise their product as a

635
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:38,280
cannabis specific product so things are

636
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,779
developing and changing rapidly so doing

637
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,609
a lot of research and buy quality

638
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,428
products that you think will have

639
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:47,009
longitude e don't fall for gimmicky [ __ ]

640
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,509
in the grow world try to find a company

641
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:50,190
that will answer you when you send them

642
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:51,808
an email try to find a company that will

643
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,179
respond to you if you've got a problem

644
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:56,579
customer service is huge in this

645
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:59,309
industry now I keep saying it no matter

646
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,289
how much great [ __ ] you buy nothing ever

647
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:03,690
will make up for building a relationship

648
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,700
with the plant and understanding the

649
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,740
plants we are growing something that

650
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,429
will probably improve your garden more

651
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,400
than anything is a solid grow book go

652
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,530
buy a cannabis specific grow book that

653
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,200
was written by a reputable cannabis

654
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:21,299
grower and a reputable author then once

655
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,120
you've got that book the next step is to

656
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,039
read the book those books do you know

657
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,199
good if you buy them and set them on

658
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:30,029
that bookshelf by the toilet I've seen

659
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,650
it I've been to your house I picked up

660
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:33,389
that grow Bible that is right by your

661
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,309
toilet the spine of that book has never

662
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,600
been cracked [ __ ] open it and read it

663
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:38,039
it's not going to do you any good

664
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,389
sitting there on the Shelf that

665
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,308
knowledge isn't gonna fly out of the

666
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,110
book into your head you have to open it

667
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:45,210
and read it then once you are done

668
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:47,369
reading that grow book the next step is

669
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,890
to buy another grow book from a

670
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:52,079
different author and read that one then

671
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,240
combine the knowledge you got from both

672
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,299
books and develop your own understanding

673
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,220
for these plants understanding the

674
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:02,069
plants we are growing and having a solid

675
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,049
goal will be more useful than any piece

676
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:06,689
of equipment you could buy at any gross

677
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:09,210
store on Amazon or any sort of wizardry

678
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,370
you could ever find learn the plants

679
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,700
develop a relationship with each

680
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:15,569
cultivar touch it feel it smell it pay

681
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,120
attention to it

682
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:21,240
take notes all of that is free and that

683
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:23,519
is probably the best way to improve your

684
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,900
garden alright that was a good rant that

685
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,009
was a great question thank you for that

686
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,290
that wraps up the portion

687
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:32,829
question of this email but there is more

688
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:35,019
it goes on section 3 says please give a

689
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:36,309
big shout out for white Mike hey white

690
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:38,259
Mike you're getting another shout out on

691
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:40,569
the show it is time for you to come be

692
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:42,339
on the podcast the message continues it

693
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:44,980
says I heard that a few listeners did

694
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:48,309
not relish Mike's wider industry view I

695
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:51,309
do not agree at all I love white Mike's

696
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:54,039
contribution to the podcast people like

697
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:56,109
Mike and yourself remove the stigma of a

698
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:58,899
bunch of potheads justifying their own

699
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:00,879
habits by presenting a mature thoughtful

700
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,130
and well reasoned approach to the

701
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,170
industry and the culture and that is a

702
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,030
great sense I love that thank you man

703
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,529
that means a lot to me I kind of wanted

704
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:10,269
to start the show to break some of the

705
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:11,980
myths dispel some of the rumors about

706
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:14,139
cannabis kind of take some of the fear

707
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,089
away from cannabis and so I'm glad that

708
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,950
you see they were trying to do it in a

709
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:20,889
professional manner I appreciate that

710
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:23,170
the message continues it says this helps

711
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,240
to break down the bigoted views and any

712
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,400
lingering stigma from a hundred plus

713
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,730
years of prohibition I particularly

714
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:33,040
loved episode 400 in which you Mike and

715
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,690
another guest discussed the things that

716
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,450
you do not like about the business

717
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,279
regulations and the culture your guest

718
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,140
was not a fan of dab rigs because they

719
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,460
looked like drugs that was our friend

720
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,020
Clint big shout out to Clint I hope

721
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,360
you're listening to the podcast bro I

722
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:48,490
thought that was such a good discussion

723
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,319
to have I have no issue with dab rigs

724
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,079
but I totally get that look like drugs

725
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,659
view that those opposed or without much

726
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:58,539
knowledge will fastly well fasten upon

727
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,460
to justify their agenda yes sometimes a

728
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:02,259
dab rig can kind of look like you're

729
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,029
doing other drugs I've got this big

730
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:05,710
glass bowl on here I'm heating with the

731
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,599
torch and then I'm dropping [ __ ] into it

732
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,559
it does look a little suspect if you

733
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,659
don't know what I'm doing

734
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,730
so I understand your view and I do

735
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,470
understand Clint's view on it make sure

736
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,029
you listen to episode 400 if you want to

737
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,990
hear more about that we're gonna keep

738
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:22,690
moving where was I it says it says this

739
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:25,240
sort of grown-up warts-and-all approach

740
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:27,250
is what the industry needs more of then

741
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,009
he wraps it up by saying if necessary I

742
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,720
will set up a GoFundMe page to save

743
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:33,640
white Mike that's pretty funny don't

744

if either you and/or white Mike ever

764
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:13,269
venture over the pond to the UK then you

765
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:15,369
both have a place to stay and then he

766
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:18,099
says where he says just drop me a line

767

let's go overseas and have a good time

772
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,809
Mike was just over there recently I did

773
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,400
not get to join him but Mike went to

774
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:32,200
France for his birthday we talked a

775
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,600
little bit about that on the show part

776
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,549
number five says if you ever want a

777
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,199
foreign contributor to your shows I

778
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:41,139
would be more than happy to contribute

779
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,279
you just did and I appreciate it he goes

780
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,100
on to say that it would be interesting

781
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:46,960
to get a non-us Canadian attitude as to

782
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:49,209
what's happening all over our continent

783
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,160
which I do agree with that it would be

784
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,600
neat to get a little over the pond kind

785
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,160
of a report so if you've got some

786
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,899
recording equipment maybe we could work

787
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,269
out a little brief segment maybe

788
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,230
occasionally just drop in a little

789
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:01,150
pre-recorded part if you're able to do

790
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,370
that keep in touch with me I would love

791
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,320
to hear your ideas on that now he does

792
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:07,500
wrap up the email with cheers guys

793
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,049

794
