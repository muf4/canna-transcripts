that part what do we need to do next

85
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,560
recently I told you guys about an app on

86
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:24,479
my iPhone called the photon app I use it

87
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,479
as a light meter a par meter for my grow

88
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,238
space I'm able to measure how much light

89
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,479
I am actually giving the plants instead

90
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,280
of going it looks bright dude I actually

91
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,518
have some sort of a meter a measuring

92
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,158
device to show me a quantifiable number

93
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,239
on a screen that says they're getting

94
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,719
this much light and it feels pretty

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,200
accurate a lot of people have given this

96
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,598
app this device a lot of good Praise on

97
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,318
the App Store so recently the app has

98
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:48,839
offered a new product called a diffuser

99
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,679
previously we've been using a piece of

100
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,519
paper folded into a loop with a piece of

101
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,360
paper on it and we're putting that over

102
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,438
the camera of our phone to use that as a

103
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,280
light diffuser it does not give you 100%

104
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,799
accurate readings it is close it is good

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,479
enough it gives you a range to kind of

106
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
try to be in if you repeat this the test

107
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,119
every time the same way then you will

108
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,840
get repeatable results you can kind of

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,599
say it works good here it works good

110
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,719
here it works at 13 or 23 real well you

111
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,719
can make notes that way but they've put

112
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,120
out their own diffuser it is now

113
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,478
available through the app they do not

114
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,959
pay me to say this this is not

115
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,719
advertising this is just to let you know

116
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,478
I mentioned this app to you and now

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
there is a product that goes along with

118
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,560
the app called the diffuser that goes

119
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,399
over your camera phone that properly

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
diffuses the light so that you can get

121
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,638
an accurate reading it was actually made

122
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
for your phone for this app uh it gets

123
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,918
really good reviews uh the app gets even

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,720
better reviews now that we are using the

125
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,719
diffuser from the company that makes the

126
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,160
app so if you're using the photon app

127
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,120
there is now a new product you can add

128
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,919
to it uh I think if you open up the

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,759
photon app there's a thing on the right

130
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:52,519
top right or top left a little bar thing

131
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,280
you can click on there it will open up

132
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,399
the store you can buy the new diffuser

133
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,198
up your game set yourself up for Success

134
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,839
once again they don't pay me to say this

135
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,919
I just know that light meters are very

136
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,758
expensive and they are very useful uh we

137
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,359
found basically a free version you got

138
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,038
to pay about four to six bucks for the

139
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,319
upgrade and then I think the new piece

140
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:13,639
is about 20 $25 30 bucks for a really

141
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,560
accurate light meter is unbeatable go

142
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,240
look for one at a store they are quite

143
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,360
expensive all right I think I have

144
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,079
covered all of the uh business part of

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,120
the podcast let's work our way into the

146
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,478
fun part of the grow from your heart

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,120
podcast in a previous episode I did

148
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,000
mention some of my grower pet peeves I

149
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,199
did mention that the word s it kind of

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,199
drives me nuts I did write down another

151
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,639
pet peeve for today's podcast um I'm

152
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,120
trying to be light-hearted about this

153
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,560
but this is stuff that sometimes when I

154
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,639
walk into a grow it just drives me

155
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,399
freaking nuts uh something I don't like

156
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,560
to see anymore I think we have evolved

157
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:47,758
past and I am still guilty of this up

158
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,199
until recently I don't like bamboo

159
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,759
sticks in the grow especially bamboo

160
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,600
sticks that are uncovered if you just

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
got that Pokey stick popping up out of

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,080
the end of a pot it's probably perfect

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,120
height for me to either bend over and

164
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,478
poke it in my eye or kneel down to look

165
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
at the pl plant and as I'm looking it

166
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,639
goes right in the eyeball I don't like

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,599
Pokey sticks in the grow room I know it

168
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,960
seems simple it seems like a a small

169
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:10,159
thing to be bothered by but they're

170
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,719
dangerous and also those bamboo sticks

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,639
are uh beautiful vectors for a place for

172
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,319
a bug to hide it's a perfect spot for uh

173
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,598
pathogen just to chill down inside of

174
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,319
there's nooks and crannies and crevices

175
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,759
uh bug eggs little pieces of mold all

176
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,120
kinds of weird [ __ ] could be down in

177
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
there and they're hard to sanitize and

178
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,038
hard to clean so I don't like the sticks

179
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,240
if you're going to do the sticks if you

180
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,759
insist to get uh some of the new sticks

181
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,400
that are coated in the green [ __ ] so

182
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,598
that you can clean them uh you can

183
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,799
sanitize those more regularly and if you

184
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,519
insist on using the sticks please let's

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,120
put something on top of it I know a

186
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,198
tennis ball looks really wonky in your

187
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,879
grow room but so does Noah's Arc worth

188
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,360
of sticks popping up out of that place

189
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,159
as well so let's shy away from using too

190
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,560
many sticks in there uh and if we're

191
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,919
going to use so many sticks let's put

192
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,280
something at the top so that we don't

193
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,680
poke our precious eyes be more careful

194
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,638

281
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,958
our hands and passing recreational

282
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,959

powers that be the politicians the city

289
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,838
council they're not on your side when it

290
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,078
comes to legalizing cannabis most of

291
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,440
those types of people don't agree

292
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,719
support or condone the legalization of

293
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,000
recreational or medical cannabis so

294
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,040
you've got to sway your Council people

295
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,839

make good rules we need people on our

317
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,040
team on our side in that room setting

318
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,240
the rules if not they're going to say

319
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,559
you're allowed to have one gram of

320
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,039
marijuana because one gram you can smoke

321
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:15,159
that for five days and it's worth $7,000

322
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,958
you shouldn't have any more in your

323
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,759
possession they should say you can have

324
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,159
one plant you can only grow one plant

325
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,319
for 5 years because one plant produces

326
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,039
32 pounds and costs 100 gallons of water

327
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,120
to produce they're going to say a bunch

328
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,559
of wonky [ __ ] they need Growers they

329
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,959
need consumers they need medical

330
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,199
patients they need recreational

331
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,359
consumers all in that room to make the

332
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,240
proper decisions and rules regarding the

333
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,959
recreational Andor uh medical cannabis

334
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,480
in your area when it comes to

335
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,958
legalization also when it comes time

336
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,440
don't forget to put in somewhere to

337
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,359
smoke that's the part we kind of [ __ ]

338
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,800
ourselves on here in Colorado you can

339
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,039
grow as much as you can possibly produce

340
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,000
you can buy plenty of cannabis on every

341
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,199
corner in Colorado but the thing you

342
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,320
cannot do is safely consume that

343
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,759
cannabis anywhere except the safety of

344
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,120
your home hotels won't let you smoke a

345
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,639
lot of airbnbs won't let you smoke you

346
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,000
definitely are not allowed to smoke in

347
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,799
your car I'm not saying it doesn't

348
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,399
happen but it is illegal you're not

349
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,799
supposed to smoke at the park it is

350
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,919
definitely illegal to smoke at the State

351
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,479
Park not the skate park both probably

352
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:18,399
but any state park any federal land any

353
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,480
federal area that is illegal to possess

354
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,559
and or consume your cannabis on Federal

355
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,440
Land which is all of the state parks

356
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,518
which includes Red Rocks which I know

357
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,600
that sounds crazy but that is federal

358
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,600
land it is illegal to consume there well

359
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,240
we did not do is give oursel a safe

360
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,120
place and a safe way to consume that

361
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,360
cannabis a lot of the states that came

362
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,360
after us New York if you can smoke a

363
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,240
cigarette there you can smoke cannabis

364
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,360
there is the rule in New York and that's

365
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
all kinds of places in New York make

366
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,199
sure you include some sort of safe

367
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,320
consumption area in your legislation

368
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:50,879
when you were writing new cannabis rules

369
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,879
all right I give a big shout out to Ohio

370
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,278
let's answer the actual question here

371
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,559
that came from my friend we got super

372
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:59,120
rambling on this one um the question

373
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,599
here is let's talk about Leaf to Cal

374
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,159
ratio what does that mean I mentioned

375
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,440
that on a podcast uh what are leaves we

376
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,120
all know what leaves are right leaves

377
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,360
are the leafy part hanging off of your

378
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,278
plants what are cxes that's basically

379
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,079
the bud formation the part that builds

380
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:13,799
the bud when you break the bud apart

381
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:17,519
those little popcorns little circles

382
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:19,159
those are your cxes your bra um you want

383
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,440
a lot of those that's what builds the

384
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,278
flowers it's just a bunch of little cxes

385
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,760
stacking on topping of each other making

386
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,838
a big giant flower cluster is basically

387
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,519
what the buds are we want a lot of cxes

388
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
a lot of BRS

389
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,639
um so when you look at some weed you'll

390
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,240
see we're just going to say that the bud

391
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,560
is uh what's that that's about 16 in

392
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,039
tall right you got a 16inch tall Bud a

393
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,559
lot of times you're going to see buds

394
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,278
with a leaf here a leaf here a leaf here

395
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:46,399
a leaf here a leaf here a leaf here

396
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,240
that's a high Leaf to calx ratio if it's

397
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,198
if it looks furry like a Shaggy Dog if

398
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,560
it's a pain in the ass to trim that's

399
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,000
probably considered a high Cal or no I'm

400
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,518
saying that backwards that is a high

401
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,919
Leaf to calx ratio there's a lot of leaf

402
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,600
on there compared to how much consumable

403
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,719
bud is going to be on that plant by the

404
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,560
time you're done so basically what this

405
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,959
says is how hard or easy is that plant

406
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,159
to trim that's the uh the easy way of

407
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:12,039
saying that uh Leaf to calx ratio is

408
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,198
just the fancy way of saying how many

409
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:16,799
leaves are on that plant and how hard

410
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:18,838
will that plant be to trim you'll notice

411
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,799
some of the Girl Scout cookies crosses

412
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,160
uh the old school GSC the Girl Scout

413
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,240
cookies The Thin Mint The Forum cut all

414
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,159
that stuff it made plants with giant

415
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,079
pedals real long pedals on the leaves

416
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,319
and then a lot of leaf up and down the

417
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,879
bud not a lot of Sugar Leaf on there if

418
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,560
you were a hom grower if you were kind

419
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,720
of a lazy grower if you were on your own

420
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:38,599
and you didn't want to trim all that

421
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,480
[ __ ] off you didn't really have to

422
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,159
because all those leaves on there were

423
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,959
super Frosty and they're just real

424
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,639
little so it was real easy with the Girl

425
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,239
Scout cookies to go and break off all

426
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,159
those bigger leaves and then just give

427
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,759
it a medium trim and you're ready to go

428
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:55,120
because it had a low Leaf High Kix ratio

429
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,278
there was less Leaf more calx very easy

430
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,959
for it to trim in that situation some

431
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,439
stuff that comes from the iy genetic

432
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,559
line that has got the low leaf and a

433
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
high calx ratio would be a lot of the

434
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,239
stuff from the Jack the Ripper crosses I

435
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,959
made uh Jack Tripper will do it for you

436
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,039
uh the blueberry butcher will do it for

437
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,838
you uh the Jack Tripper stands out in

438
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:16,399
that category quite well though you'll

439
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,920
see some photos I've posted or just big

440
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,958
old long buds with like six leaves

441
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,159
coming out of it at the end of harvest

442
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,638
that's really easy to trim you don't

443
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,679
have to pay the trim crew for as many

444
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,879
hours uh it's not as much work not as

445
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,519
much processing time and the product is

446
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,639
still top shelf so that's a good way to

447
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,159
save yourself a half of a step and

448
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,720
possibly a few bucks if you're paying a

449
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:37,879
trim crew or trim people that is money

450
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,000
you can keep in your pocket uh that's a

451
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,879
profit already that you've already made

452
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,519
before you even spent it so my friend I

453
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,679
hope I covered that for you that is

454
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,360
basically how much Leaf is on that plant

455
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,239
based on the size of the bud that

456
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,199
dictates kind of how hard or how long it

457
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,919
is going to take to trim that plant uh

458
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,159
let you kind of prepare set yourself up

459
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,519
for success in your grow if you're

460
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:59,198
somebody that totally hates trimming you

461
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,919
probably want plants with with a lot

462
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,198
more calic and very little leaf ratio

463
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:06,159
all right my buddy to the roach I think

464
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,278
I answered that question quite well you

465
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,000
my dude are going to get a gift

466
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,000
certificate for a free pack of seeds for

467
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,440

strain that I have well I can't say

488
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,000

489
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,040
that are available and current that

490
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,879
people know about from IR genetics

491
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,679
they're all listed on the side of the

492
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,120

496
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:06,639
can learn a lot if you're going to grow

497
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,160
a strain you want info if you're

550
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,360
that message the question does go a

551
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,119
little bit like this it says yo rosted

552
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:59,079
Jeff my humidity and my drying area

553
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,719
suddenly spiked downward while I was

554
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,119
away for Thanksgiving so we had a Fresh

555
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,079
Harvest it sounds like that outdoor

556
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,639
Harvest was hanging up my dude went away

557
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,519
for Thanksgiving to go get some turkey

558
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,919
and mashed potatoes and while he was

559
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:14,679
away the humidity has plummeted in the

560
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,799
dry and cure area now it says my buds

561
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,320
are pretty crumbly at this point now my

562
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,038
advice uh may work for you I don't know

563
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,359
what you mean by crumbly are they

564
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,319
[ __ ] Dusty are they falling apart or

565
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,479
are they dry and you're exaggerating I

566
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,439
hope they're real dry and you are

567
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,440
exaggerating being a drama queen about

568
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,320
this it says is there anything I can do

569
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,279
to save this dry and cure um I've got a

570
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,439
couple of answers my best bet for you is

571
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,158
I don't know how much weed you've got I

572
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,798
don't know how much product there is if

573
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:43,520
you can put it in big sterlite bins um I

574
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:45,400
think they're 30 qu sterlite bins

575
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,759
they're about this wide uh can you see

576
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,240
that on camera I'll try not to edit that

577
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,319
out uh they're about uh 2 and a half

578
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,599
maybe 3 feet wide uh they're about 20 in

579
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,720
tall maybe 20 in deepish I think that's

580
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,480
the right dimensions but I would put as

581
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,679
much of the flow as you can into those

582
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,798
bins I don't know how much you've got

583
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,600
but put in the appropriate size bin and

584
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,679
then I would find if you've hopefully

585
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:10,079
got more plants growing use some fresh

586
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,400
wet leaves from a current crop just grab

587
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,480
some of those leaves chop them off the

588
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,320
plant and throw them right in that bin

589
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,200
less than you think you need I've done

590
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:19,720
this before you don't need as many fresh

591
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,640
leaves as you may assume to reconstitute

592
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,360
rehydrate some dried up plants so fresh

593
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,600
leaves would be my first bet if that is

594
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,558
not an option maybe some of those BEDA

595
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,759
packs or something similar after that

596
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:32,079
you're going to have to try something

597
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:33,519
extreme and I don't want to make any

598
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,038
recommendations to help you ruin the

599
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,200
crop at that point possibly if it's real

600
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,879
dry maybe you can just make some

601
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,720
concentrates or something out of it I

602
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,679
know everybody prefers that fresh frozen

603
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,079
but it's way too late for that what

604
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,840
you're going to do right maybe at this

605
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,798
point you can make some uh some sort of

606
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,399
concentrate a a lot of times back in the

607
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,400
day dry crumbly product would become uh

608
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,600
some sort of B I'm not going to tell you

609
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,200
to break the law or do anything crazy

610
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,119
but a lot of people back in the day

611
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,279
would make BHO show out of this product

612
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,399
I don't know if you know how to do that

613
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,879
I'm not going to recommend you do that

614
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,759
be safe don't hurt yourself legal legal

615
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,120
disclaimer insert here all right so uh

616
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,919
the humidity dropped your plants are

617
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,439
real crispy I would say seal them up

618
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,679
into a container uh put some fresh ganja

619
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,640
leaves in there hopefully you have some

620
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:16,679
fresh leaves I don't know what the

621
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,559
chances of that are I don't know if

622
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,120
you're a Perpetual grower I don't know

623
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:23,038
if this was an outdoor crop and it's all

624
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:25,319
gone uh but leaves would be my first bet

625
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,319
then a BEDA pack or something similar

626
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,720
like that and then after that you're

627
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,119
going to have to find another way

628
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,400
someone probably at this point is going

629
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,359
to tell you to put like a wet paper

630
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,840
towel or something in there that sounds

631
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,119
[ __ ] terrible but it probably will

632
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,759
work also do you have a humidifier maybe

633
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:41,519
you can hang them in a room with a

634
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,798
humidifier I really don't want to do

635
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,480
that that just sounds like you're going

636
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,158
to cause more problems so uh I would try

637
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,480
the leaves I would try the Bova packs

638
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,320
and then after that I would think about

639
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,679
making concentrates I hope you're able

640
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,678
to save the Harvest I hope you learned

641
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,240
your lesson I know you are not the only

642
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,480
one facing uh these uh trials and

643
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,880
tribulations a lot of people had

644
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,839
struggles out out there with that

645
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,760
outdoor Harvest you guys um this goes

646
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,199
back to something I say a lot set

647
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,798
yourself up for Success we know Harvest

648
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,278
