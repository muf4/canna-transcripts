year everybody thank you for joining me

74
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,479
let's kick off the new year strong what

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,640
can we do as growers as breeders as

76
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,119
cannabis consumers to kick off the new

77
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,958
year strong we should start goals and

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
journals that's right if you're growing

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
you should have a grow room journal

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
inside of that journal you should create

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,680
some goals what are you going to get

82
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,439
better at this year what did you [ __ ] up

83
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
last year in your grow that you didn't

84
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,639
like the way you did that you know you

85
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,959
could have done better what are we going

86
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,039
to improve on this year set some goals

87
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,039
set some ways to improve set yourself up

88
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,959
for success in this year if you don't

89
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,878
have any goals if you don't have any uh

90
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,080
objectives any notes how do you know if

91
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,239
you're improving how do you know what

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
you did then in the second part of that

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,759
journal let's start taking a lot of

94
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,679
notes so that when the grow comes out

95
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,399
better or worse than last time we know

96
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,560
exactly what we did so let's start off

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,239
this new year by starting a journal in

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,318
that journal let's set some goals and

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
some objectives then when we're working

100
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,479
in the grow room let's write down

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,719
everything we do when you mix up a feed

102
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,399
solution write down how much water you

103
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,840
started with sometimes it's a 5 gallon

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,158
container a lot of people have a 10

105
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,759
gallon container i rock a 30 gallon

106
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,679
reservoir in one space and another room

107
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,079
i've got a 250 gallon reservoir just

108
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,519
depends on where i'm working but write

109
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,280
down the amount of water you started

110
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,438
with and then write down everything that

111
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,120
you put into it if you mix up 100

112
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,919
milliliters of this nutrient pour it

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,480
into your 250 gallon res write that down

114
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,438
i started with 250 gallons of water i

115
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:08,318
poured in 100 mils of this 150 mils of

116
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,759
this uh this much of this nutrient uh

117
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,000
this many grams of this some of the

118
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,199
stuff i feed is in a powdered form uh

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,600
then i phd to this after i put in the ph

120
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,079
down or the ph up to get it to the 6.2

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,079
to 6.4 range i would approve of then i

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,478
checked the ec and i wrote down the ec

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,639
also so i know every nutrient that went

124
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,959
in and exactly how much i know what the

125
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,040
ec of that total solution was at the end

126
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,560
i know what the ph was now when i feed

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,639
those plants i can watch and if some

128
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,639
[ __ ] goes wrong in a few days i've got a

129
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,160
note i can say well it's because we gave

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,240
it a thousand milliliters of this

131
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,919
instead of eight fifty uh we know not to

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,319
give it eight not a thousand just to

133
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,599
stick at a 50 maybe 900 next time we

134
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,360
push that [ __ ] a little too hard she

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,840
got a little bit fried that's the way

136
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,840
that you can learn we uh

137
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,679
we're cannabis consumers not only if

138
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,560
most of us who are cannabis growers and

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,160
breeders we are heavy cannabis consumers

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,000
i really enjoy there's nothing like

141
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,000
taking a couple of fat dabs or smoking a

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,680
big fat joint on the way to the grow

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,038
place wherever you're going to grow uh

144
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,959
maybe you don't smoke in the car while

145
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,240
you're driving smoke uh right when you

146
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,519
get there we just got to be safe with

147
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,600
what we say you know what i'm talking

148
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,799
about uh don't smoke in the car don't

149
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
smoke while you're driving follow all

150
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,319
the legal laws but uh smoke right before

151
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,839
you go into the grow space if that's

152
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,519
legal it's like a zen feeling i just

153
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,879
like to get [ __ ] stoned and go in

154
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,038
there and work i'm in the zone i got the

155
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,959
music going i'm in my bubble my element

156
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,399
that's where i feel super comfortable on

157
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,239
the stage behind some drums and in a

158
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,918
grow room and obviously behind this

159
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,840
microphone doing a podcast or some of my

160
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,680
comfort zones so i like to get a little

161
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,879
blazed and go in there unfortunately

162
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,639
when you get blazed and go in there you

163
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,519
get in the zone you just start doing

164
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,759
[ __ ] like mix up nutrients adjust the ph

165
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,159
test the ec water the plants catch some

166
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,160
runoff test the runoff sometimes a lot

167
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,600
of people do runoff reports we're not

168
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,199
going to delve into the runoff reports

169
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,439
right now but a lot of people will also

170
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,319
test the runoff of the feed solution the

171
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,399
plants are going to have a little

172
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,120
drainage gather that test it check the

173
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,879
ec and the ph of that document that if

174
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,399
you understand how to decipher that code

175
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,639
later in the future that may help you

176
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,239
solve some problems but uh you're going

177
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,199
to be in there doing your routine and

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
then you're just going to do stuff

179
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,919
you're going to get in the flow and then

180
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,240
you're going to run into either great

181
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,439
success or great problems in the future

182
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,000
and you're not going to remember what

183
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,600
you did to cause that uh success or that

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,199
failure if you would have just done a

185
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,280
few things taken a couple of notes do a

186
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,960
few things take a couple of notes the

187
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,879
bigger the grow the more notes i take

188
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,318
which uh i guess that's because it's uh

189
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,240
it's a lot more of an investment but

190
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,080
i'll carry a clipboard around and a big

191
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
grow and just write down what i did all

192
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,519
day and if i've got a couple of guys

193
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,879
doing work i have them report to me at

194
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,399
the end of the day and i fill out just a

195
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,719
big report of everything that got done

196
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,279
in every room i tried to compile all of

197
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,039
the ec reports uh the feed reports all

198
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,638
the what got defoliated what got

199
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,560
lollipopped and twisted if there were

200
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,400
any equipment issues that were noticed

201
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,879
if any bugs were issued i noticed in the

202
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,799
room write down everything that you can

203
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,959
in that grow space that way like i said

204
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,720
if you have good success or big failure

205
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,159
you can repeat those results then you

206
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,759
can create what is known in the

207
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,319
commercial industry as a standard

208
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,639
operating procedure you know that on day

209
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,560
one we do this on day two we do this you

210
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,240
can write a book and then every time you

211
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,639
grow you can follow your own instruction

212
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,000
manual and you can nail that [ __ ] then

213
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,840
you can learn how to improve until

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,360
you've got some sort of standardized

215
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,719
sample you don't know that you've got

216
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,400
evidence that you're proving that's why

217
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,080
we want to keep notes see what we're

218
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,439
doing all right i've been rambling let

219
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,399
me check on my notes and see where we

220
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,120
were

221
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,839
write down everything that you spray if

222
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,519
you are spraying food a pesticide or a

223
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,839
foliar application whatever you're

224
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,918
applying to the plants write that down

225
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,159
in colorado we're required to write down

226
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,680
any pesticide application uh the

227
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,360
pesticides have to be approved by the

228
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,598
colorado department of agriculture the

229
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,720
colorado uh department department

230
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,000
department of public health and

231
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,759
environment that's a lot of letters to

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,839
remember uh they have to be on an

233
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,080
approved pesticide list you have to

234
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,239
write down the pesticide you applied how

235
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,000
much of it per gallon of water how many

236
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,240
gallons of that solution were mixed up

237
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,800
and applied the epa number of the

238
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,639
pesticide you used the time you applied

239
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,400
it the plant numbers of which got

240
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,720
applied there are a lot of notes to be

241
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,878
taken in a commercial environment why

242
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,960
not just start doing that in your own

243
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,479
personal grow that way there are a lot

244
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,239
of advantages to writing down these

245
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,918
pesticide applications if something goes

246
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,439
wrong in the future you've got that

247
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,878
paper trail you know what you sprayed

248
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,639
you know what you applied you know why

249
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,919
you've got that weird rash on your arm

250
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
when you go to the doctor you could say

251
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,758
on five days ago i applied this uh

252
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,598
here's the bottle don't bring the bottle

253
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,960
bring the label peel the label off take

254
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,719
the label to the hospital with you when

255
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,159
you go see the doctor show them what you

256
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
used explain how it happened tell them

257
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,199
you didn't use proper protective

258
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,120
equipment you got a little rash from it

259
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,639
but write down so everything we do in a

260
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,158
commercial grow has to be written down

261
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,519
and marked get in the habit of doing

262
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,599
that now because what if you end up

263
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,278
working in a commercial grow why not

264
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,800
make it a habit and then you can tell

265
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,919
when you go apply for the job you can

266
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,399
say i'm already documenting pesticides

267
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,439
to department of agriculture colorado

268
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,799
department of public health and

269
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
environment standards i'm already

270
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,719
practicing that standard in my personal

271
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,000
growth so i'm comfortable doing it in

272
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
the commercial environment just set

273
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,639
yourself up if you want to work in a big

274
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,639
grow that'd be a good thing to do so i

275
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,480
think i've rambled on for the first part

276
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,240
of this podcast long enough start a

277
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,320
journal you guys let's set ourselves up

278
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,919
for success in this new year we got a

279
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,240
brand new calendar year you just turned

280
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,319
the page how many harvests are you going

281
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,200
to pull off this calendar year can you

282
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,040
get six harvest can you get 5.5 harvest

283
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,560
can you stagger them out what is your

284
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,000
goal do you just want four harvests you

285
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,759
have enough rooms to get sick harvest

286
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,919
that's another issue uh what is your

287
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,600
goal what are you going to improve on

288
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,079
what did you really suck at before what

289
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,000
are you not happy with

290
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,639
many people their clone game sucks many

291
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,480
people aren't exactly sure how to sex a

292
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,080
plant many people are afraid to pop

293
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,519
seeds because they don't know how to

294
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,759
tell the difference between a male and a

295
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,440
female let's jump in if you're afraid of

296
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,958
that i'm here to help you out we've got

297
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
a lot of resources that will help you

298
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:50,159
out my discord server my website me

299
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,759
personally the podcast the irie army we

300
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,919
will definitely help you identify your

301
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,759
males and your females so pop some seeds

302
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,838
maybe that's a new new goal for the year

303
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,919
start from seed let's just have a goal

304
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
expand or grow you're not going to get

305
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,639
any better if you keep doing the same

306
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,399
thing maybe you're cool maybe you're

307
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,159
satisfied with your grow but

308
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,759
don't you want a little bit more for

309
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,278
your money maybe you can just learn how

310
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,120
to save a little bit of electricity and

311
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,799
still put out the same amount of product

312
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,320
maybe we can save you a few bucks

313
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,838
somewhere and that will help you out

314
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,760
even if your product is as good as you

315
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,079
think it can be maybe we can save money

316
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,838
on lights air water soil maybe a little

317
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,439
bit of labor there's going to be a way

318
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,800
that we can improve you this year all

319
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,720
right i've been rambling set some goals

320
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,120
write down some details write down what

321
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,680
you feed what you mix what you did

322
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,078
have a schedule write down a schedule

323
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,078
and a plan and a goal get some sort of a

324
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,000
flow how long do your clones live in the

325
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,599
clone machine how long do your seedlings

326
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,278
stay in that small section when do you

327
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,519
put them into smaller pots and have

328
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,039
small veg how long do they go into the

329
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,159
bigger veg how long do you veg those

330
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,399
plants then when do you put them into

331
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,319
flour when they go into flour how often

332
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,240
do you defoliate when do you lollipop

333
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,079
when do you pop and twist when you start

334
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,480
adding your bloom boosters based on your

335
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,000
specific feed schedule have a plan let's

336
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,000
set some goals and routines based on

337
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
this new schedule we've got for a brand

338
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,278
new year let's set ourselves up for

339
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,959
success you guys write everything down

340
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,720
all right i've been rambling about that

341
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,359
part for long enough i want to segue

342
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,639
into the second half of this podcast if

343
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,879
you will um it finally snowed

344
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,958
that may not be a big deal to you

345
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,799
here in colorado we've been getting very

346
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,958
worried about uh drought like conditions

347
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,679
because we're not getting any snow we're

348
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,919
into january i always say that we get

349
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,599
snow on halloween i make a big joke that

350
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,399
we arrange our halloween costume in

351
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,920
colorado

352
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,519
around the weather because it always

353
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,360
snows on halloween you see people out

354
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,879
there uh the girls in their tinker bell

355
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,919
costumes and the guys in there whatever

356
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,360
costumes i don't even know what dudes

357
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,120
wear anymore uh they're out there in

358
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,399
their costumes little tiny uh just

359
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,679
little walmart outfits because you don't

360
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,759
buy expensive [ __ ] for halloween they're

361
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,439
just freezing their nuts off i always

362
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,600
joke that you got to set your costume up

363
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,120
around a jacket or some long sleeves

364
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,120
that's why i was always chewbacca you

365
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,480
get that long just a big fur suit i

366
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,720
don't even wear anything under it and

367
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,120
i'm nice and warm all night

368
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,959
sorry i gave you that detail anyway uh

369
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,879
we didn't get any snow it's been too

370
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,239
many months without some snow sound like

371
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,679
an old guy talking about that but that

372
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,919
brings drought-like conditions so we

373
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,159
don't get any water for the summer which

374
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,439
leads to uh forest fires which leads to

375
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,838
[ __ ] like what is happening in the

376
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,839
boulder uh superior area right now which

377
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,120
is devastating um if the weather would

378
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,040
have been a little bit more moist a

379
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,959
little bit more snow a little rain we

380
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,879
may not have had such devastating fires

381
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,479
all right i sound like an old guy sound

382
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,000
like a two old guy sitting on the porch

383
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
we don't get no water soon but that's

384
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,480
really how it is but we finally got some

385
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,519
snow and when it snowed boy did it snow

386
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,159
it is deep out there i drive a ford suv

387
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,320
and the snow is up to about uh at least

388
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,919
halfway a little bit past halfway from

389
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,240
my tires which is a lot of snow for my

390
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,479
area i live in the city here i usually

391
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,959
don't get that much so it dumped on us

392
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,639
nature is confused my point is you guys

393
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,919
it is cold now it just suddenly went

394
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,079
from uh really nice to super duper cold

395
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,000
here if you are in colorado if you're in

396
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,399
north america now is the time if you

397
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,360
have not already now is the time to jump

398
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,600
our grow rooms into winter conditions

399
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,200
winter preparations i don't know your

400
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,480
grow space i don't know your grow

401
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,720
environment i don't know where you're

402
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,039
growing at all but if it gets cold

403
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
outside now is a good time to make some

404
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,719
adjustments we can learn a few things we

405
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,799
can save some electricity we can move

406
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,720
heat around to the right places may not

407
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,199
have to duct as many things let's talk

408
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,160
about a few things to adjust now that it

409
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,000
is winter time because uh being growers

410
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,240
being indoor growers this is mostly

411
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,799
going to apply to the indoor growers

412
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,639
we do have to learn to adjust and adapt

413
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,639
we can't expect the exact same things

414
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,079
that worked in the summer to work for us

415
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,320
in the winter we may need to make some

416
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,799
gear changes some room changes uh just

417
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,040
some basic adjustments just to uh

418
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,719
maximize potential for our garden we

419
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,399
want our plants to still do the best in

420
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,560
the winter as they do in the summer

421
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,278
honestly my fall crop when i grow

422
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,518
indoors in my personal grow my crop like

423
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,679
around halloween is always the best

424
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,879
because it's not super hot it gets hot

425
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,638
here in the summer i'm in southern

426
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:01,439
colorado we'll have 102 110 days he gets

427
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,519
negative 17 in the winter so that fall

428
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,519
crop when it's like actually tolerable

429
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,278
conditions for plants and humans and you

430
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,198
don't have to fight the sun and the snow

431
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,958
in your grow space those crops are

432
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,278
always the finest in my opinion for me

433
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,719
those are the most successful

434
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,879
but we've got to learn to adjust and

435
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
adapt due to seasons now let's talk

436
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,078
about a couple of adjustments that i

437
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,320
make automatically when the winter comes

438
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,719
i usually run in the summer spring time

439
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,160
the warmer part of the year i run led

440
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
lighting you guys know that i recently

441
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,919
fell in love with the led lighting i've

442
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,919
been running the canon leds from black

443
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,838
sail big up to our friends at black cell

444
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,439
market

445
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,800
uh whatever else their slogans are these

446
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
days keep up with our friends black sail

447
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,559
market give them a follow good lightings

448
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,639
uh good lighting i've been using the

449
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,719
canons i love them they make my plants

450
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,919
uh bushy and dense and they do all the

451
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,199
things i need them to do now that i've

452
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,198
learned them it was a learning curve

453
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,799
figuring out how to use the things but

454
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,519
in the winter

455
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,759
those lights do not provide enough heat

456
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,399
to keep my grow space warm so to keep

457
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,360
that room warm i simply replace the led

458
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,078
lighting with hps lights i put up uh i

459
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,079
take down a few uh leds and i put up

460
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,559
three hps lights and those keep that

461
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,399
small space warm very efficiently i

462
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,638
don't have to duct the air out too much

463
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,078
i do run a duct out to get the humidity

464
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,399
out but i don't run it as often as i

465
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,399
used to during the summer uh so i switch

466
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,799
those lights out to create some heat i

467
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,440
don't want the cool leds in the winter i

468
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,958
actually want the hot hps lights in the

469
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,920
winter now here's another thing that i

470
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:33,119
do i put those lights on a different

471
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,278
schedule i will run the hps lights

472
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,600
during the night times so instead of

473
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,480
having the lights on from 9 00 am to 9

474
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,519
pm now i will run the hps lights from 9

475
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,278
p.m till 9 00 a.m i do make sure to

476
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,120
carefully adjust my light cycle if i've

477
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,480
got plants in flower uh but i'm

478
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,560
experienced in doing that and i've also

479
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,920
done a full podcast on how to do it uh

480
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,838
just be careful if you're adjusting

481
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,278
plants that are in flower don't just uh

482
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,800
don't give them a long day give them an

483
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,120
extended night to get back on schedule

484
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,439
as the tip there but i will run the the

485
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,679
lights during the night because it gets

486
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,079
colder at night it gets colder at night

487
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,399
naturally the sun goes down it's colder

488
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,879
i use my grow lights to keep the space

489
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,440
warmer during the day the heater's on

490
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,360
the sun is up that grow space will stay

491
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,880
ambiently warm it stays the same

492
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,320
temperature as the rest of the building

493
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,519
the rest of the house which is ambient

494
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,920
temperature because there's central

495
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,278
heating so the the place stays warm

496
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,599
during the normal part of the day but

497
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,439
when it gets cold outside that sun drops

498
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,040
everything gets colder and so to keep it

499
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,600
a little bit warmer in there the lights

500
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,519
do come on during the night cycle uh

501
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,278
during the night time it's not the night

502
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,879
cycle it is the night time for us when i

503
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,399
would be asleep the lights are on it

504
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,078
works out that way for me very well some

505
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,078
people can't do that i understand that

506
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,638
that is one quick adjustment that i do

507
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:47,838
make another thing that i think about is

508
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,000
moving and ducting my hot air those warm

509
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,079
lights are creating hot air i've got a

510
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,320
veg room which is also filled with warm

511
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,559
air i used to duck that air out of the

512
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,480
grow area it used to go outside so that

513
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,359
it would just get away from the grow now

514
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,879
that it's warm i utilize that heat maybe

515
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,400
sometimes i'll dump some of that heat

516
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,318
into a bedroom and just warm up the

517
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,480
house with it if the rooms are right and

518
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,078
conditions work out sometimes i'll dump

519
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
the heat from the veg room into the

520
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,519
flower room during the night time so

521
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,160
that that flowering room will get some

522
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,240
heat during its dark cycle and not get

523
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,079
too cold while the lights are off these

524
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,000
are all small adjustments that you can

525
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,318
learn to custom tailor for your grow

526
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,679
space what do you need to do where are

527
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,838
you getting too much heat where would

528
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,280
you like that heat to go where is it too

529
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,599
cold where would you like that cool to

530
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,918
go learn to manipulate and move that air

531
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,918
around and save yourself on electricity

532
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,600
and ducting make your grow room as

533
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,520
sufficient as you can make it the winter

534
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,199
time is a good time to learn that it's a

535
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,519
completely different struggle than

536
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,360
during the summer so learn to move the

537
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,960
air around instead of dumping it

538
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,879
outdoors don't waste that hot air in the

539
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,720
winter here you heated up that air let's

540
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
put it somewhere useful if nothing else

541
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,600
dump it into the house and keep the

542
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,759
house warm you've already paid for the

543
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,678
electricity to warm that air up let's

544
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,679
keep that heat in the house in somewhere

545
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,160
in the facility to at least warm up a

546
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,840
grow room maybe warm up a bedroom warm

547
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,000
up something that is my point don't

548
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,240
waste that hot air now let's think about

549
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,558
something else if you are dumping that

550
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,640
hot air out somewhere are you melting

551
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,240
the snow in a weird section to where

552
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,480
your whole neighborhood knows that that

553
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,240
is a grow think about where the heat is

554
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,759
going we've all seen that photo from

555
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,759
canada where the guy's got the apartment

556
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,679
building and his apartment is the only

557
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,200
one with the snow melting off of it and

558
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,280
they busted him for growing weed in

559
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,200
there are you doing that in the winter

560
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,519
are you snitching on yourself is your

561
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,600
blower melting snow in an awkward place

562
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,038
or does your roof the only roof that

563
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,879
attic space the only space in the

564
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,400
neighborhood without a bunch of snow on

565
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,000
it because your grow is up there melting

566
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,519
that snow think about how you're going

567
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,919
to bust yourself here in the winter

568
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,079
because the snow could give you away

569
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,200
beware of the evidence is what i wrote

570
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,918
all right another thing i want to talk

571
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,558
about is warming up our water which we

572
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,400
use to water our plants in one of the

573
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,240
commercial grows that i used to run the

574
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,640
water would come from a well basically

575
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,038
outside into the building in the winter

576
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,880
that water would be extremely cold we'd

577
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,640
have to put heaters in the reservoirs to

578
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
warm up the water i don't know where

579
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,559
your water comes from if the water is

580
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,160
coming from outside in the winter the

581
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,079
pipes are outside it's got to come from

582
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,440
somewhere if it's coming into your home

583
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,319
into your commercial facility it's

584
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,919
probably really cold my advice fill up

585
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,558
your reservoirs whatever you're holding

586
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,919
water in fill those up the night before

587
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:23,839
and a lot of the commercial grows where

588
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,759
i work we will just get trash cans on

589
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,639
wheels a big rubbermaid or a brute trash

590
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,558
can a 50 gallon trash can on wheels

591
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,799
we'll fill those up with water then we

592
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,798
will move those into the veg room under

593
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,160
the veg lights to stay there overnight

594
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,400
when you come back they have reached

595
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,480
room temperature they're safe to use

596
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,960
don't water your plants with extremely

597
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,079
cold water i wouldn't go less than 70

598
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,000
degrees maybe 68 at the very lowest but

599
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,599
you don't want cold water watering your

600
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,400
plants just think about putting your

601
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,000
toes your balls your hands and some cold

602
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,280
water it's going to piss you off it's

603
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,880
not going to make you want to drink or

604
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,639
eat just going to make you angry that

605
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
we'll do the same thing to the plants

606
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,480
let's not piss them off

607
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,559
just get that water nice and warm the

608
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,759
plants will thank you for that also

609
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,399
another thing we could do is get the

610
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,158
plants up off of the ground if the grow

611
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,919
room is cold if you're growing in the

612
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,240
basement or a commercial facility with a

613
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,880
concrete floor let's not have the plants

614
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,640
on the floor that floor is very cold if

615
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,320
you aren't comfortable walking around on

616
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,000
that floor barefoot the plants are not

617
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,000
comfortable there either we're going to

618
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,599
put that water or that plant on the cold

619
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,798
floor then we're going to pour water

620
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,879
into it and that cold floor is going to

621
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,079
make that water really cold the roots

622
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,919
are in there they're not going to feed

623
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,599
properly your ph is going to get all out

624
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,240
of whack things are going to go really

625
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,319
wrong so if you can get those plants up

626
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,599
off of the floor raise them up off the

627
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,759
floor it doesn't take a lot you could

628
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,759
get another pot whatever size pot you're

629
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,599
using buy another one flip it upside

630
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,359
down it'll raise your plant up a couple

631
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,798
of inches set the plant right on top of

632
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,639
that it is off the floor you could use

633
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,558
pallets i don't like pallets because i

634
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,840
kick them i trip on them uh and they're

635
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,200
wood i don't like adding that wood into

636
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,519
the grill but if that's what you got to

637
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,759
do that's what you've got to do i would

638
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:02,000
prefer you get uh make a get a table

639
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,839
with a hydro tray in there and put the

640
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,798
plants in that and put a drains where

641
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,839
they could drain into something

642
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,440
underneath and you could pull out the

643
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,959
drain to get rid of the water that's

644
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,720
spinning some money that's going in on

645
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,480
it but get those plants up off the

646
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,558
ground for the winter because like i

647
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,000
said if you can't put your bare feet on

648
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,599
that floor and walk around and some of

649
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,359
