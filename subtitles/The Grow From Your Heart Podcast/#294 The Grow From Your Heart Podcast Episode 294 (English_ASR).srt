smoking on today I am dabbing on some of

17
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:38,039
this lemon og live resin from our

18
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:39,719
friends at the garden of Weeden I

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,609
scooped a little bit out of the large

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,768
container I've got a fairly large

21
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,539
reserve I scoop some out of there I put

22
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:47,399
it into a smaller container and then I

23
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,350
opened up some of these lemon Jeffrey hi

24
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,389
terpene full spectrum extracts from our

25
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,658
friends at apothecary and I dumped the

26
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:56,249
high terpene extract into the live resin

27
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:57,960
and I gave it a little stir and I've

28
00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:00,478
been taking dabs of that it tastes

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,920
tremendous the high goes straight to my

30
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,719
brain it feels amazing

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,640
it's like fireworks and skyrockets for

32
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,960
your brain I like it

33
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,000
great combination so that's what I'm

34
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,709
dabbing on let's keep it quick let's do

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,810
a quick update on my most recent

36
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,038
breeding project if you've been paying

37
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,100
attention you know that I've been

38
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:20,218
working on a blueberry cookies reversal

39
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,538
project I have a blueberry cookies plant

40
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,908
that smells amazing

41
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:26,368
I have reversed it I took the female and

42
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,460
turned it into a male it produced pollen

43
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:31,618
I put that pollen on several elite

44
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,449
females I put it on the Durbin poison I

45
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,459
put it on a rise I put the pollen on

46
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,679
more blueberry cookies I put it on

47
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,139
platinum tangi Strawberry Fields and

48
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:42,868
lemon skunk I'm trying to breed a bunch

49
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,200
of candy flavored sweet and sour Terp

50
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:48,810
sort of things I'm hoping I've created a

51
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,879
big bag of candy so those are just about

52
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,890
done you guys they are at day 60 right

53
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,358
now some of the seeds in the very tops

54
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,218
of the plants are just about finished

55
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:57,269
the seeds that the lowers are taking a

56
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:59,218
little longer to finish of course

57
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:01,259
they're almost done I will start

58
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:04,919
chopping those down here in just a few

59
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,108
days so I've got some new creations we

60
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,789
will need some new names soon once

61
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:10,169
things are tested so that's an update on

62
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,150
the breeding projects I'm gonna let them

63
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,179
go

64
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,680
63 to 65 days that's usually just about

65
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,900
perfect for the strains I'm working with

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,299
so they'll be cut down depending on my

67
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,010
schedule and how my life goes in three

68
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:23,120
to five days and then we'll have some

69
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,590
new stuff to play with

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,900
alright so that's an update on the

71
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,299
blueberry cookies breeding project the

72
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,950
blueberry cookies but in there it's in a

73
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:33,290
three gallon pot it's under a small

74
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:36,109
white and that bud is as big as my

75
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:38,298
forearm I am amazed at the size of Cola

76
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,220
that plant put out especially for being

77
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:42,079
seated that is tremendous

78
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:44,719
alright let's move forward and keep this

79
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:47,510
Thursday quickie going I got a message

80
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,479
from somebody on Facebook and they said

81
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:52,219
when you guys go eight to nine weeks of

82
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,108
flowering are you considering that from

83
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:56,000
the twelve twelve switch or from when it

84
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:57,969
actually starts pre flowering just

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,180
trying to get a better timeframe on

86
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:03,829
finishing so this person is asking when

87
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,659
we say that a plant will take nine weeks

88
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:08,359
to flower are we counting that nine

89
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:11,060
weeks from when we see the first signs

90
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:13,579
of Bud set or from the day we switch the

91
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,239
light cycle from whatever our veg time

92
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:19,040
is over to our 1212 flowering time that

93
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,129
nine week flowering period or whatever

94
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,429
your package of seed indicates that is

95
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:27,318
from the day you flip your timer to

96
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,109
twelve twelve if you were on a 24 hour

97
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,988
or an 18-6 or a 19-5 whatever your veg

98
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:37,159
cycle was the day you flip your timer to

99
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:40,909
12 on 12 off that has now become day one

100
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,469
of week one of your flowering period so

101
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:45,079
if you're gonna go sixty-three days that

102
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:47,509
starts now not from when you see bud set

103
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:50,180
that starts from them the time you flip

104
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,888
so mark your calendar eight to nine

105
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,079
weeks from there and start paying

106
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:56,030
attention that is day one of flower week

107
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,099
one of flower start adjusting your

108
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,598
nutrients to that schedule start

109
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:01,668
planning your flowering you're flushing

110
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:04,128
your harvest everything will go around

111
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,840
that date now something I've got to

112
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:08,870
mention as a responsible grower a

113
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,150
breeder and educator do not let those

114
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,209
numbers printed on the package dictate

115
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:17,750
too heavily when you cut down it is a

116
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:20,180
good guideline it's a good idea but each

117
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,639
plant is going to be different if you

118
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,500
get ten seeds out of a package and five

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,599
of them are males and you cut them down

120
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,839
you've got five females left you may

121
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,879
have one phenotype that ends or finishes

122
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,699
at the end of week eight it may be day

123
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,350
56 and that one is ready to cut down you

124
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,599
may have another one that needs to go

125
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,180
all the way to day 60 you may have

126
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,800
another that needs to go to day 63 there

127
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,110
may be one that [ __ ] around and wants

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,480
to go to day 70 so you're going to need

129
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,780
to pay attention to each individual

130
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,480
plant start flushing 10 to 14 days in

131
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:56,439
advance of your anticipated harvest time

132
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,450
but don't hold too hard to that number

133
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:01,490
pay more attention to the trichomes on

134
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:02,860
the plant get yourself a scope a

135
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,019
magnifying glass

136
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,000
get yourself a 420 scope or a dope scope

137
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:09,409
or a jeweler's loupe or something from

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,040
the gross store or something on Amazon

139
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:15,470
that will magnify your trichomes at

140
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,950
least sixty to a hundred times you want

141
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,570
a 60 X or a 100 X magnifier at minimum

142
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:22,399
so get yourself a light or something

143
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:23,839
with a light in it and LEDs so that you

144
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,639
can see what you're looking at and a

145
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,529
nice jeweler's loupe or add oaks go up

146
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,610
or a magnifying glass or something you

147
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:31,279
can get in there and look at the

148
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,720
trichomes and see the trichome color and

149
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,909
the trichome development you want them

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,890
to start becoming amber I've got a scope

151
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,840
that hooks up to my computer it's a

152
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,969
dynolite scope I think it cost around a

153
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,500
hundred bucks and I got it on Amazon it

154
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,700
plugs right into my computer it was kind

155
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,079
of a [ __ ] to get it installed to

156
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,550
installed on my macbook it took me a

157
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,300
minute once I got it figured out it

158
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,790
works like a charm

159
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,680
every time I plug it in so get the Dino

160
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,479
lights go plug that into your MacBook

161
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,889
Jerry the computer into the grow room or

162
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,779
carry a plant near your computer and

163
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,069
press that magnifier whatever you're

164
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,379
using press the magnifying glass the

165
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:02,449
magnifier the dope scope your 420 scope

166
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:03,829
your Dino lights go pressed up against

167
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:05,990
the plant and see what your trichomes

168
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:07,490
look like check in several places the

169
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,620
top is gonna be a little more done than

170
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,160
the bottom in most cases check on the

171
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,759
top you're looking for twenty to thirty

172
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,770
percent

173
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,990
amber trichomes the trichomes are those

174
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:19,939
the crystals those mushrooms grown off

175
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,990
the plants those skinny stalks with

176
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:23,389
round bulbous heads

177
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,978
that's a trichome they're gonna start

178
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,779
off clear they're gonna get kind of

179
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:28,490
silvery then they're gonna get milky

180
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:30,679
white then they're gonna start degrading

181
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,259
and turning it's gonna look like you

182
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,720
sprinkled dr. pepper on them you want

183
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,459
about thirty percent of them to look

184
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,200
like they've got dr. pepper on them

185
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:41,209
when you look in the screen you're

186
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,649
probably gonna see depending on how soon

187
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,329
did you've got your stuff and how many

188
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,159
try comes on your plants you're gonna

189
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:47,959
see between ten and thirty try comes in

190
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,230
that little view on your viewfinder on

191
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,609
your magnifier so if you've got ten you

192
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,439
want three of them to start turning

193
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,449
amber does that make sense

194
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,980
thirty percent twenty to thirty percent

195
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,949
amber trichomes is what you're looking

196
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,170
for when you harvest the number on the

197
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:05,569
seed pack is a good idea but they don't

198
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,280
know exactly which phenotype you got

199
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:08,870
they don't know the temperatures in your

200
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,029
grow room they don't know what kind of

201
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,639
grow light you're growing with there's

202
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:16,699
so many variables that contribute to the

203
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,439
finishing time of a plant that it is the

204
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,479
numbers on the package are simply a

205
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,149
suggestion and a guideline and

206
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,950
unfortunately quite often a sales pitch

207
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:26,209
why not tell you that this plant is

208
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:28,069
gonna be done in eight weeks when it

209
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,239
could really take ten weeks but who

210
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,819
knows because I've already got your

211
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,530
money unfortunately a lot of breeders

212
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,420
will do that stuff and back in the day

213
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,379
that used to be a very easy way to

214
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,970
increase sales

215
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,649
you can't do it so much anymore and it's

216
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,030
not something I would do but it can't be

217
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:43,529
done so much anymore because we're much

218
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,629
more accountable now we're reachable

219
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:48,449
social media makes the breeders very

220
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:50,459
accountable anyway that's not something

221
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,839
I would have done but it is something

222
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,759
that has been done people would just

223
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,139
print hey this flower finishes in eight

224
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,639
weeks and you grow it and it ends up

225
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,589
taking seventy days and you're sitting

226
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,849
there going what the [ __ ] or a lot of

227
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,169
people just cut it down early and then

228
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,030
they thought man this plant sucked it

229
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,470
wasn't very good and it was because they

230
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:06,750
didn't let it go to its full potential

231
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,500
so don't be that guy don't cut plants

232
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,730
down early

233
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,009
hopefully the seeds that you have are

234
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:17,160
from a breeder who had some morals and

235
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,779
actually wrote down a realistic time

236
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,030
frame on their plants I try to give a

237
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,919
two-week time frame on my packaging or

238
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:25,589
on my strain descriptions if you ask me

239
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,660
how long will this take I will say eight

240
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,279
to nine weeks or nine to ten weeks and I

241
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,470
try to keep it realistic and I've grown

242
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,879
enough of my plants to know how long

243
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,110
they're actually going to take maybe

244
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,939
some of the other breeders aren't

245
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,649
growing enough of theirs and maybe they

246
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,840
think it only takes eight weeks I don't

247
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,699
know but don't hold too fast to what

248
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,740
that says pay attention to each plant

249
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,300
pay attention to each phenotype the

250
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,100
beauty from grown from seeds is that you

251
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,349
can find something unique you can find

252
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,300
that one maybe you want something to

253
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,950
take maybe you've got cycles that take

254
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,779
eight weeks maybe you've got cycles that

255
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,550
take eight or nine or ten weeks maybe

256
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,319
you can find a plant that fits perfectly

257
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:00,359
into your system so you could dial it in

258
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,950
perfectly that's part of the beauty of

259
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,930
growing from seed so you get to find the

260
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,700
one that you like you get to find the

261
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:07,799
one that grows smells tastes and smokes

262
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,930
the way you like but also you get to

263
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:13,740
find the one that works the best in the

264
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:15,299
grow room for you as the grower so

265
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,669
that timeframe goes from the time you

266
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:20,129
flip your lights to twelve twelve that

267
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:22,439
is day one of that's when you should

268
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,450
switch to your bloom nutrients that day

269
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,670
is what you should base your anticipated

270
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,680
flush time off of that date is what you

271
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:30,539
should base your anticipated harvest

272
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,939
time off of that day is what you should

273
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:35,879
adjust your nutrient calendars off of so

274
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,850
day one is when you change your timer to

275
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,529
twelve on and twelve off all right you

276
