73
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,550
the State Patrol a state trooper was

74
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,109
actually pretty damn cool he walked up

75
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,610
to me and he said sir I pulled over

76
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,410
cause you're going a little too fast and

77
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,820
my only answer was yes sir cuz I knew I

78
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,979
was going too [ __ ] fast so I told him

79
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:47,269
yes sir he said can I see your license

80
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:48,409
registration proof of insurance and I

81
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,790
already had it in my hand because I'm

82
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,969
quick and organized I was like here you

83
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:55,340
go sir and he said uh do you have any

84
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:56,689
marijuana in the vehicle and I hesitated

85
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,909
for a minute and I wasn't gonna lie to

86
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:00,319
him I was thinking I looked at my

87
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,789
backpack and I looked to my center

88
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,949
console on my car then I look toward the

89
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:05,780
backseat to see where all my bags were

90
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,589
and see what I had with me and I looked

91
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,750
him straight in the face and I said

92
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,920
there might be some weed in here sir and

93
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,419
he kind of looked at me weird and I said

94
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,849
but I've got a medical marijuana card

95
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:15,500
and I assure you I'm not intoxicated by

96
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:17,239
any means and it was early in the

97
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,189

128
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:16,728
an official warning and he told me to

129
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,048
send it on the dash to remind me to quit

130
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:19,909
speeding so I did that I've got the

131
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,259
warning sitting up on the dash so that

132
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,700
every time I start to get in the left

133
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,409
lane to pass somebody it reminds me of

134
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,579
hey you're gonna get a ticket next time

135
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,950
because that cop is really cool to you

136
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:29,120
last time so I've got a warning

137
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:30,379
up there I want to give a huge shout out

138
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,360
to this state trooper I'm not gonna say

139
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:34,370
his name but shout out to the state

140
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,770
trooper he did not harass me when I

141
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,030
completely wreaked of cannabis he did

142
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,639
not write me a ticket when I was

143
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:42,379
obviously blatantly speeding so a big

144
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
shout-out to the Colorado State Patrol I

145
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:45,949
appreciate it you did not [ __ ] my day up

146
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,660
you did not [ __ ] my life up things could

147
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,920
have gone very differently as we've

148
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,870
learned with my friend John Randall's

149
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,379
jr. so a big shout out to the State

150
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,149
Patrol

151
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:55,490
big shout at the Jah Rastafari for keep

152
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:57,079
a nice straight through that yeah so you

153
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,550
guys it's all about how you handle the

154
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,079
police if you're in Colorado and you get

155
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,069
pulled over and they ask if you've got

156
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,439
cannabis in the car

157
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,459
just admit it because lying to the cops

158
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,680
is illegal

159
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:08,419
having cannabis in Colorado is not

160
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,949
illegal if you're gonna lie to him about

161
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,540
having weed he's not gonna trust you

162
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:13,459
he's gonna think you hiding some [ __ ]

163
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,319
you don't need to Hydra weed in Colorado

however they are called the dank

203
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:31,819
team.com

204
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:33,680
sometimes they have my seeds available

205
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:36,170
they are currently sold out is what I'm

206
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,910
told they will get a package in the

207
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,470
future I can't promise you win I don't

208
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,790
know when they'll put them on sale I

209
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,139
don't know if they'll even make it to

210
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,460
the website they may have people

211
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,918
I end up on a waiting list already I

212
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,418
don't know but I do know as soon as as

213
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:48,740
soon as they get those seeds they sell

214
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:52,008
out quickly so you'll have to pay

215
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,718
attention to the dank team.com if you're

216

00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:03,769
not sure if the sour seed company is on

221
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,050
there but I highly recommend the sour

222
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:07,848
seed company you can never go wrong with

223
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,218
the Cali connection and you can never go

224
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:11,478
wrong with DJ short seeds so find

225
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:13,189
yourself some good seeds even if they

226
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:14,990

message I'm gonna go ahead and open up

239
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,060
the Facebook page I've got it it's

240
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:45,740
taking my phone a second

241
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:49,490
I might add part of this out where's the

242
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,829
damn message okay all right so this

243
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,629
message comes from a friend on the Grove

244
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:55,430
from your heart podcast Facebook page

245
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:57,139
this is from our friend Elizabeth and

246
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,329
she says quick question I'm growing a

247
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,009
few a few plants from seed and I was

248
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:03,560
wondering if when I take a cutting to

249
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:05,658
flower for determining sex if I should

250
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,069
flower the clone or the rooted seedling

251
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:08,810
I could swear that I heard you say it

252
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:13,009
was better to flower the rooted seedling

253
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:16,430
then I remember that correctly um there

254
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:20,300
is not a rule to this this is kind of

255
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,860
personal preference if so what let me

256
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,389
back up and tell you basically what this

257
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,500
person is asking just to be more clear

258
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,329
in case you guys aren't caught up to

259
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,968
what this the question here is when you

260
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:30,709
grow a plant from seed you don't know if

261
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:32,028
that plant is a male or a female unless

262
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,309
of course it came from feminized seeds

263
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:36,549
so if you grow a regular seed it's got a

264
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,658
50/50 chance of being a male or a female

265
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:42,168
you don't want to waste a lot of time

266
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:44,028
space energy nutrients and water on a

267
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,500
plant that you don't need so unless

268
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:47,899
you're breeding you need to eliminate

269
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,720
your male plants

270
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:52,850
so once your seed plant gets large

271
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,830
enough I recommend taking a clone from

272
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,980
it let that clone establish healthy

273
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,650
roots now you need to flower either the

274
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,080
original plant from seed or that clone

275
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,659
to determine if that plant is a male or

276
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,820
a female it's really up to you if you

277
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:09,588
want to flower out the plant that came

278
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,930
from seed or if you want to flower the

279
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:15,260
clone there are advantages and

280
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:17,149
disadvantages to both sides if you've

281
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,919
got that plant that came from seed and

282
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:20,838
it's big enough to take a clone

283
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,539
once that clone is rooted and you know

284
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,790
you've got a copy of it you're safe to

285
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:27,949
flower out that seed plant the original

286
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:29,750
plant from seed because now you've got

287
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,580
to back up in the clone room in the mom

288
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,320
room whatever in the bedroom you've got

289
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,430
a backup of that plant over there and

290
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,290
you've already got a plant that's

291
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:37,969
established and that's large and that's

292
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:39,980
healthy and is ready to flower and ready

293
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,810
to throw out some buds for you so you

294
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,149
can always flower out that seed plant

295
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:46,159
the advantage to that is it's already

296
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:48,528
there it's ready to go you've got it a

297
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,049
big healthy plant some people really

298
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:52,669
like to keep that original seeded plant

299
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,319
from seed around as their mother they

300
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:56,299
like to keep that one because it was the

301
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,040
original and they feel like it's got

302
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:00,049
more vigor and it's got more strength to

303
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:02,208
it but I feel like if you take a clone

304
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:04,399
and you do it properly and that clone is

305
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:06,679
cared for and the mother plant the donor

306
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,269
plant was healthy when the clone was

307
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,799
taken I feel like the clone and that

308
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:12,649
seed plant are going to be the same

309
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,028
thing so you can take your clone you can

310
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,278
let your clone root you can get your

311
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:18,169
clone into soil you can get it into a

312
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:19,700
good pot get some roots established you

313
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:21,829
can do it in a cup I've done this in

314
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,528
cups I've ran phenyl hunts from cups

315
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,150
before I've done plenty of plant sexting

316
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:28,370
while plant while clones were just in

317
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:30,139
little tiny cups so you can take your

318
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,669
clone and you can either pot it into a

319
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:33,259
larger pot if you want or you can leave

320
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,490
it in the cup and put it in the flower

321
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,069
room and put it into flour

322
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,930
change the lights to 12 12 and of course

323
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,330
within 7 to 10 days you're gonna see if

324
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,949
that plant is a male or a female now one

325
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,980
of the main advantages to keeping your

326
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,620
clones and cups and using the cut method

327
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,259
to do a sexing round is that it takes

328
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,330
way less space to run a whole bunch of

329
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:55,429
cups than it would run a bunch of potted

330
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,280
plants so if you're doing a large Fino

331
00:10:55,429 --> 00:11:00,959
hunt of like maybe 25 to 50 plants it's

332
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,129
much easier to have 25 to 50 cups

333
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,050
underneath the light with little tiny

334
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:06,120
clones in there just waiting to show you

335
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:07,769
sex and that way you didn't waste time

336
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,690
drawing large plants and then you grew

337
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,039
out a male that was a waste of time so

338
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,440
that's the advantage to do in the cups

339
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,909
it's one of the advantages um it's up to

340
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
you whichever you want to do really if

341
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,539
you want to take it always take a clone

342
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,789
so grow that plant from seed take a

343
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:22,559
clone get the clone rooted and then it's

344
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:24,719
up to you if you want to run that clone

345
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,669
as your flowering plant to determine sex

346
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,680
go for it if you want to run that seed

347
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:30,839
as your flowering plant to determine sex

348
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,750
go for it as long as you keep one of

349
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,040
them back to have in the future if you

350
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,570
run that clone you've already got a big

351
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,089
mother plant waiting to give you more

352
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,190
clones if you run the mother plant that

353
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,769
came from seed you've already got a big

354
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,260
bushy plant there are advantages in a

355
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,059
production facility what I do is I plant

356
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,519
the seed I let the seed grow I take the

357
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:52,699
clone as soon as that clone shows me

358
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,199
roots I throw that clone into a pot and

359
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,150
then I actually flour out the original

360
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,280
plant from seed because it's already big

361
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,870
enough it's ready to go and honestly in

362
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,299
a commercial production facility I don't

363
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,990
have a lot of time in space for extra

364
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,819
plants

365
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,830
sitting around and I don't want to waste

366
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,210
my plant count because we are based on a

367
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,620
plant count because we are a medical

368
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,110
facility we're allowed to have so many

369
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,730
plants so since I've already got a plant

370
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,980
that's large enough to flower I go ahead

371
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,659
and flower that plant out to find out

372
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,269
what I've got if I find out that I've

373
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:22,860
got a male usually I go throw that I cut

374
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:24,689
that male down take it out of computer

375
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,029
system and then I go and take down every

376
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,180
clone also that I have made of that male

377
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:31,259
plant and we eliminate those as well so

378
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:34,229
that we don't have any males sitting

379
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:37,379
around and that is how mainly how we

380
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,700
work on sexing our plants there is

381
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:40,439
another method this kind of helps me

382
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,259
segue into something else I wanted to

383
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,080
talk about which is revenge another

384
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,549
thing that you can do I do not use this

385
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,650
method I know plenty of people that do

386
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:52,529
for me this seems a little bit harsh to

387
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,850
my plants what some people do you can

388
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:56,100
take a plant and put it into your

389
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,560
flowering room for seven to ten days

390
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,080
just long enough to show you sex usually

391
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,549
I think I can spot a male more early

392
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,420
than I can a female because I've been

393
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,579
doing it for so long

394
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:07,799
I think the male's try to show you sex a

395
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,660
little bit sooner so take your plants

396
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,639
put them in the flowering room let them

397
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,120
start showing you sex as soon as you are

398
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,860
sure of the sex

399
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,539
take them out of the flowering room put

400
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,149
them back in the bedroom under to uh

401
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:21,129
under 24 hours of light and they will go

402
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:22,838
back into veg for you it may take them a

403
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:25,929
couple of weeks but they will go back

404
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,940
into veg so what some people do they

405
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:30,579
plant a seed they let the seed grow

406
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,839
until it's you know decent-sized right

407
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,850
when you put that seed into your three

408
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,770
gallon pot let it get rooted and then

409
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,149
move it to the flour room and then they

410
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:38,350
just leave it there for a few days and

411
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,419
now they've got a little plant that's

412
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,830
starting to show sex and then as soon as

413
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,990
it shows sex they put it back in the

414
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,910
bedroom if it's a female they put it

415
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,950
back into the bedroom and grow it up to

416
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,539
the bigger size that they want then take

417
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,520
a clone from it and then flower that

418
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:53,588
plant out now this sounds harsh but it

419
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,778
does have its advantages the main

420
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:58,060
advantage here is that you don't need to

421
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:59,710
take any clones and you don't waste a

422
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:01,539
lot of time and space growing anything

423
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,980
so you take your plants and you put them

424
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:04,269
into flour and as soon as you see boys

425
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,070
you throw them away

426
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:07,419
and then now you can just move your

427
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,190
plants right back into the bedroom and

428
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:12,309
just grow those females up to their full

429
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,230
size so you establish sex without taking

430
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,939
any clones and now you know what you've

431
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,139
got and you've eliminated your boys so

432
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,779
when it comes flower time you know

433
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:21,699
you're working with all girls I highly

434
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:23,439
recommend taking a clone from everything

435
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,778
so before you flower those plants please

436
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,310
take a clone because you might grow the

437
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:28,689
most amazing cannabis you've ever had

438
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:31,019
and if you don't have a clone from it

439
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:34,600
you're going to kick yourself in the ass

440
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:38,169
Reve edging is also used after harvest

441
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,149
I've seen people finish a plant you take

442
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:42,159
a plant that takes nine weeks to flower

443
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:44,919
you flower it out for nine weeks you

444
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,719
harvest most of it but you just leave

445
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,389
one or two branches on that plant and

446
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,610
then put that plant with one or two

447
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:54,490
harvested plant with one or two branches

448
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,620
on it under 24 hours of light and it's

449
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,839
gonna take probably two months honestly

450
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,539
before that plant starts to grow back as

451
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,550
a normal vegging plant and if you didn't

452
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:06,278
take a clone this is your only way to

453
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:08,319
rescue your strain you take this sad

454
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:09,850
look in mostly harvested plant and you

455
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,890
torture it by putting it under a light

456
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,420
for about two months you want it under

457
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:15,639
24 hours of light you want to feed it

458
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:17,259
kind of a heavy nitrogen diet that'll

459
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,569
bring it back around to the veg stage

460
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:21,129
the leaves are gonna start curling and

461
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,379
looking like arthritis hands they're

462
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,750
gonna be spirally the plant is gonna be

463
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:26,799
pissed off for quite a while but as soon

464
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,539
as you see those norm

465
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,699
leaves start coming out your plant is

466
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:32,469
going back into its normal stage the

467
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,000
hormones have started reconverting back

468
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,920
into the veg stage it's starting to know

469
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,320
what's going on with life again what I

470
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,879
would recommend at that point as soon as

471
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,778
you have a couple of healthy shoots that

472
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,450
look normal

473
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:45,730
clone those and take those clones and

474
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,190
use those clones as your plants and now

475
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,019
you've got that strain around again keep

476
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,880
one clone and flour out the other clones

477
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,220
and now you've got that strain forever I

478
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:55,809
don't recommend that but if you do make

479
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,310
the mistake of not taking a clone and

480
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:58,719
you realize that this plant that you're

481
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:00,969
growing is going to be one of the most

482
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,000
amazing things you've ever seen Reve

483
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,800
edging is probably the only way to

484
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,600
rescue this strain other than a tissue

485
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,309
culture and I am not prepared to teach

486
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,190

podcast so Elizabeth I hope I answered

488
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,459
your question I know I did not give a

489
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,778
definitive answer I know I said that

490
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,250
it's kind of up to you and your

491
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:19,958
environment and the way that you want to

492
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,789
do things but I hope I helped you out

493
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:25,119
and thanks for giving me the opportunity

494
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:28,990
to talk about how to sex your plants and

495
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,600
revé edging alright my next topic comes

496
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:34,690
from at the barefoot girl run Instagram

497
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,009
also known as will on Facebook will had

498
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,230
no idea I was gonna talk about this

499
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:41,169
we'll post it a Facebook post today that

500
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,839
simply said stop smoking blunts in your

501
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:45,338
grow room and that is such a good post

502
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,860
you had no idea I was gonna talk about

503
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,690
this on the podcast today but I see

504
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,430
people posting pictures of themselves on

505
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,920
Facebook on Instagram and on snapchat

506
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:55,778
and they are smoking blunts smoking

507
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,299
Bulls and smoking dabs in the grow room

508
00:16:55,778 --> 00:17:00,970
and I think it's a really bad idea I

509
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:03,909
think smoking a blunt in a grow room is

510
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,890
going to impart that blunt taste on your

511
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:08,049
growing buds before those buds are even

512
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,759
done they're already going to taste like

513
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:11,918
a dirty blonde trap I'm sorry you guys I

514
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,299
don't prefer the flavor of a blonde we

515
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,770
grow some of the best cannabis we can

516
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,269
possibly grow on this planet and then

517
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:18,129
you wrap it up in a shitty-ass tobacco

518
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,619
leaf with some fake flavoring in it I

519
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,689
don't dig it I smoked it back wood with

520
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:24,789
my buddy the other day not my thing

521
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,650
I'm not into the blunts but I feel that

522
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,088
blowing this blunt smoke on your plants

523
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,550
around your plants is gonna make your

524
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:32,319
plants taste like a dirty ass blunt but

525
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:35,049
also here's what we'll had to say about

526
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,730
this will said tobacco smoke is very

527
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:38,379
thick and actually can suffocate your

528
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,299
plants stopping the photosynthesis

529
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,600
process because the plant will be too

530
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,009
busy

531
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:45,099
breathing and filtering the smoke to

532
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:47,200
take in co2 and then he also goes on to

533
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:48,668
say also blunts and most

534
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,259
over-the-counter tobacco products have a

535
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:52,059
ton of chemicals in them that are bad

536
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:53,529
for your plants cigarettes are the main

537
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:55,720
concern but blunts will begin to show

538
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:57,730
harmful results if done regularly and

539
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,740
frequently really you shouldn't smoke

540
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,940
anything in your grow room I agree with

541
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,190
that and then he says but if you're

542
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,440
going to it should be a bull the less

543
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,830
carcinogens in the air the healthier

544
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,259
your plants will be I think I agree with

545
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:13,359
that will good post great post you guys

546
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:14,679
quit smoking in your grow rooms you

547
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,939
don't want to be in the grow room giving

548
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,380
your plants smoke you want to be in the

549
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,830
grow room giving your plants love and

550
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,059
co2 don't blow smoke in there just keep

551
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:23,259
the plants clean you're gonna ruin the

552
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:26,288
terpenes it's all about the Terps

553
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:27,669
nowadays and nobody wants tobacco turps

554
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:29,288
in their cannabis maybe I'm wrong maybe

555
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,809
somebody wants to backhoe trips in their

556
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:33,400
cannabis but 99% of the world doesn't

557
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:35,349
want tobacco turps in their cannabis and

558
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,659
nobody wants to backhoe turps in their

559
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:40,029
concentrates so stop smoking blunts in

560
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:42,549
your grow room stop smoking anything in

561
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:44,109
your grow room go outside go smoke

562
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:45,849
outside go to the candy candy and go

563
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:47,349
smoke at the can of canyon go smoke at

564
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:48,428
the dab table just don't smoke in the

565
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:50,740
grill room it's not good for your plants

566
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,690
and quit smoking cigarettes and tobacco

567
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,319
anyway let's just get down on cannabis

568
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,419
you guys Organic cannabis all right I've

569
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,678
been talking for nearly 19 minutes so I

570
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,320
think it's time for me to press pause

571
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,620
take a drink take a fat dab and I will

572
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,119
be right back hang tight alright you

573
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:09,158
guys I have back I took a couple of fat

574
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,389
dads and I got a nice drink while I was

575
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:14,409
taking a drink I was drinking some

576
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:16,450
kombucha some GTS kombucha organic and

577
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:18,429
raw original with enzymes and probiotics

578
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,779
and it reminded me that a listener

579
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:22,179
recently asked me a question about

580
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:23,558
probiotics he asked me if I could

581
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:26,500
recommend a brand he asked about a

582
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:29,589
specific brand honestly what I like is

583
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:32,169
the brand raw pro Briah probiotics you

584
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:35,079
can buy specific blends for men or women

585
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:36,280
or for older folks or for children so

586
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,589
I'm pretty sure that the person that

587
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,899
emailed me was a dude so I would

588
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:42,428
recommend the raw probiotics for men

589
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,038
that are available at most health food

590
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:46,690
stores those are the probiotics I would

591
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,539
support now let's talk more about

592
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,580
cannabis related stuff somebody recently

593
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:54,099
sent me a message asking me if I think

594
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:56,019
holding in your smoke gets you higher

595
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:57,879
if you take a dad if you take a bong rip

596
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:00,039
if you smoke a joint do you feel like

597
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,140
holding your head holding your smoke in

598
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:04,029
your lungs gives you a better buzz in my

599
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,140
opinion I'm going to say I'm not a

600
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,029
doctor let me put that out there

601
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,400
straight up I'm not a doctor this is my

602
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:12,519
stoner opinion I feel like when I take a

603
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,410
DAB I feel like most of what I'm going

604
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,960
to get goes into my lungs pretty quickly

605
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,850
within probably three seconds at the

606
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,740
most maybe five seconds I have absorbed

607
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:23,469
everything that that dab is going to

608
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,120
give me so I get it in I let it sit for

609
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,509
about a half a second maybe a second I

610
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,889
pull in the dab and then I blow it back

611
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:31,210
out it's only in me for just a brief

612
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,460
second just so that I can feel it in

613
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,930
there then I push it back out I feel

614
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,160
like when you keep the smoke in your

615
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,590
lungs is when it's going to cause

616
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,180
problems I feel like my lungs absorb

617
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:41,799
everything they're going to get really

618
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,630
quickly if I keep that smoke in there

619
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm gonna start absorbing the tars and

620
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,470
the soot and the extra crap the smoke is

621
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,029
going to stick to my lungs and I don't

622
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,970
want that I want to get the cannabinoids

623
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:55,299
I want the THC I want the CBD the CBG I

624
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,190
want the good medical benefits not the

625
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:59,649
bad part of the smoke so I think taking

626
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,539
a big fat dab and holding it in you

627
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,400
might not get higher I think you're just

628
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:05,619
getting a head rush from lack of oxygen

629
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,300
and you're just feeling a rush because

630
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:09,189
you're not giving yourself any air and

631
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,289
also I feel like that pressure having

632
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,289
your lungs inflated like that is

633
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,639
probably very strenuous on your lungs

634
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,409
you could probably hurt yourself by

635
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,600
doing that and then those people that

636
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,920
take in a big hit and they cough and

637
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,679
they try not to cough and hold in the

638
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,360
big hit you make this noise you start

639
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,799
doing that [ __ ] I really feel like

640
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,389
that's gonna blow something up in your

641
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,680
body you're gonna rupture the lung or

642
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,630
[ __ ] blow a blood vessel in your

643
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,340
brain I think you need to get the smoke

644
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,170
in and out I don't think smoke needs to

645
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,490
sit around in your lungs that is my my

646
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,810
opinion I don't think you get higher

647
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,309
from it I don't think you're going to

648
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:42,129
absorb more from it I think that's gonna

649
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:44,250
happen almost instantly I think you're

650
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,470
just putting it yourself at risk for

651
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,920
COPD or other lung problems in the

652
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,740
future

653
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,480
I want to elaborate on this a little bit

654
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:57,430
one thing that I think happens um I take

655
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,289
ginormous dabs sometimes I like to take

656
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:02,140
a big fat dad the other day I took a two

657
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:04,839
gram dab I didn't cough let me be clear

658
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,370
I'm not I'm not able to put two grams on

659
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:07,699
the nail and pull it all into my lungs

660
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:09,408
in one draw

661
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,090
because I just can't get the I would

662
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:13,789
have to put the nail really hot to get

663
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:15,859
it to burn or vaporize that quickly so I

664
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:17,898
am taking multiple inhalations but I'm

665
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:19,668
not taking a break I'm dropping two

666
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:22,009
grams one and a half to two grams of

667
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:24,830
dabs on the nail just drop it right on

668
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,658
there you gotta kind of slowly stir it

669
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:28,579
into the nail and let it melt into there

670
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:30,740
and then carb cap it and just start

671
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:32,839
sucking on that rig pulling a big fat

672
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,308
hit blow it out pulling another rip blow

673
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,949
it out sometimes it'll take me three or

674
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:39,349
four full inhalations a full lung expand

675
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,960
and out of my lungs but I'll smoke two

676
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:43,730
grams and one dad I call that one dad

677
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,350
that is one dab I didn't take a break or

678
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:50,000
anything but it wasn't all one rip I

679
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:52,699
feel like I can feel the hash coat my

680
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,038
lungs and I feel like I'm kind of giving

681
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,730
myself a time-release medicine I'm

682
00:22:55,038 --> 00:23:01,638
smoking so much hash in one quick time

683
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,440
period that I am coating my lungs with

684
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:04,969
enough oil to where my body can't absorb

685
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,669
it all at once but there's nowhere for

686
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,380
it to go so all this oil kind of hangs

687
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:11,990
out all this hash is just hanging out

688
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,360
stuck to my lung and as my body can

689
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,399
absorb it that hash is right there so my

690
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,648
lungs are just sucking up that hash oil

691
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:20,298
the whole time and I'm just absorbing

692
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,918
those cannabinoids and absorbing those

693
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:24,648
medicinal qualities so I'm giving myself

694
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,330
a time release medication by taking

695
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:27,109
these ginormous dabs that's something I

696
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:29,329
think is happening

697
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:31,788
I have no science to that but I feel

698
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:33,470
like I stay high I stay getting high I

699
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:35,388
just keep getting higher and higher and

700
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,889
higher as it goes and I haven't

701
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:38,538
sometimes I won't have smoked for a full

702
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:42,439
hour and I'll still be fully medicated

703
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:44,329
because I think that layer of dab that

704
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,370
is coated in my lungs is just being

705
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:48,528
absorbed by my body slowly and getting

706
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:50,329
into my bloodstream so that's my

707
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:52,220
elaboration I hope I answered your

708
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:53,928
question my opinion holding smoke is a

709
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,240
bad idea you don't need to hold it in

710
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:58,220
don't be cheap take another dab breathe

711
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,769
it in blow it out take another damn dab

712
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,139
I got another dab for you I think your

713
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:04,909
lungs only get so much use before they

714
00:24:03,138 --> 00:24:06,859
wear out I think you get so many inhales

715
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:09,470
and exhales of your lungs before they

716
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:11,178
were just gonna tire out so don't wear

717
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,409
your lungs out by holding in smoke just

718
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:14,570
blow it out get it out of there that's

719
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,620
my opinion let's see I got a couple of

720
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:17,298
more things I want to talk about and

721
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:20,058
then we're going to wrap up this podcast

722
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:21,529
here's something random you guys wear

723
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,629
some protective eyewear in your garden

724
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:25,190
um the lights are bright if you're

725
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,690
running more than four maybe five or six

726
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,789
lights in there you need to get yourself

727
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,309
some method seven glasses and protect

728
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:33,529
your eyes from the lights also protect

729
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:35,569
your skin if you're in a room with 10 or

730
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,430
more lights and you're in there for more

731
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:39,470
than a few hours a day it's a good idea

732
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,029
to wear some sort of long sleeves

733
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,910
keep your head covered keep your eyes

734
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:46,039
covered it's just I believe that those

735
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,630
lights are not good for your skin the

736
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,250
Sun gives us cancer why won't these

737
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,410
artificial lights give us some sort of

738
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,329
skin problems you guys are highly

739
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,980
recommend covering up your skin and your

740
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:58,250
eyes if you're in the grow room all day

741
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,779
long I wear my method seven glasses from

742
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,920
the minute I walk into the grow room to

743
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:02,990
the minute I walk out I've got the

744
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,310
method sevens on I like to wear a long

745
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,870
sleeve shirt in the grow room it gets

746
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,759
kind of hot but it's still worth wearing

747
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:09,619
a long-sleeve shirt also here's

748
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,819
something really random when you're in

749
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:12,469
the grow room if you've got a bunch of

750
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:14,359
sticks if you're using sticks in there

751
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,819
to support your plants watch your eyes

752
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:18,109
around those sticks I saw somebody bend

753
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,730
over the other day to take care of a

754
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:21,469
plant and if he wasn't paying attention

755
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,269
that stick would have gone way far into

756
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,730
his eye kind of poked his eye I didn't

757
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:27,529
hurt him because he saw it coming he saw

758
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,420
it cuz it literally went into his eye he

759
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:31,220
was kneeling down put the stick right

760
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,930
into his eye didn't [ __ ] him up he

761
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,160
survived he'll be just fine but I don't

762
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,470
want that to happen to any of my

763
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,180
listeners or any of my friends so be

764
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,549
very aware of those sticks in your grow

765
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,279
room I don't use the sticks I use my

766
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,200
personal grow I like a tomato cage and

767
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,940
the commercial girl we like to use the

768
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,230
big trellis nets of course I have used

769
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,230
the sticks before and I'll probably use

770
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,460
them again but that's not my preferred

771
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,339
method at this time and if you were

772
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,039
using them I do recommend that you watch

773
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:59,659
your eyes since I'm talking about grow

774
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:01,309
room safety here's another thing you

775
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,620
should think about you should have a

776
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,149
smoke detector inside of each grow room

777
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:07,939
and you should also have a fire

778
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,620
extinguisher on the exterior of each

779
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,789
grow room don't put your fire

780
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:13,099
extinguisher inside the grow room

781
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:14,240
because if there is a problem in there

782
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:15,879
you don't want to have to kick down the

783
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,690
door go in there and get your fire

784
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,160
extinguisher and try to put the fire out

785
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,960
you want that fire extinguisher on the

786
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,279
outside by the door so that if

787
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,960
something's wrong and kick the door down

788
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:26,680
and spray the [ __ ] out of that fire

789
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,750
solve the problem so smoke detectors and

790
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,580
fire extinguishers are a big advantage

791
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,309
for your grow put that [ __ ] in there

792
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:35,480
keep yourself safe alright guys I think

793
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:37,639
that's all I've got for this pod

794
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,200
cast pretty soon I've got Jesse coming

795
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,970
back for another outdoor grow less and

796
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,769
Jesse if you're listening it is time you

797
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,180
can bring the boys we can do a swap cast

798
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:47,059
if you don't know what a swap cast is

799
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,940
I'm gonna tell you Jesse and 44 and

800
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:52,159
dirty D they have a podcast called the

801
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,019
Colorado podcast I want to have them

802
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,330
come on here all three of them will

803
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:58,099
record one podcast and we will both put

804
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:00,169
it out on our feeds so we'll do a

805
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:02,119
Colorado grow from your heart podcast

806
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,130
combination we'll talk about growing

807

dope we'll talk about Colorado life and

808
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,640
then we'll both put it up on our feeds

809
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:10,129
