8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,750

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,990
tent if you're ready for new feminized

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,179
or regular seeds I highly recommend

13
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:43,709
Oregon elite seeds and you can find them

14
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:45,920
at www.opm.gov/openseason de kadam inant

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,579
the potency label says this contains

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,559
68.8% THC and eighty 2.3 percent total

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,939
cannabinoids I'm gonna crack it open and

18
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,149
give it a fresh smell so I can describe

19
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,920
it properly for you the first thing I

20
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,960
should mention is the appearance and

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,899
texture of this concentrate there is a

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,478
perfect amount of chunky diamonds and a

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,090
beautiful amount of saucy Terp sauce in

24
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,549
this container the color is the perfect

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,530
golden color that I expect the Terps are

26
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,820
not too runny the crystals are not too

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,430
big or too small

28
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,829
I really approve of the consistency of

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,180
this product this is a great batch of

30
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,310
concentrate here I'm gonna give it a

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,630
smell that's what I opened it up for all

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,909
right at the first smell you get some

33
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:28,349
gas with the background of pine and then

34
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,670
as it sits on your nose and you let it

35
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:31,048
sit by your face for a little bit it

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,840
starts kicking in a little bit of a

37
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,670
skunky aroma I really do enjoy that type

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,070
of a concentrate that type of flavor and

39
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,780
aroma that classic OG Kush kind of a

40
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,149
skunky earthy sort of a thing going on

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,189
there's a really great aroma and flavor

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,560
coming from this product but again what

43
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,359
I really like is the size of the chunky

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,100
diamonds and the amount of diamonds

45
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,000
compared to the amount of Terp sauce

46
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,649
what happens in a lot of saucy live

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,819
resin ambrosia there are a lot of

48
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,439
different names for these types of

49
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,118
products but what happens to a lot of

50
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,129
these products is sometimes you'll get a

51
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,750
really big diamond and a little bit of

52
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,459
Terp sauce in there or sometimes you'll

53
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,649
get a whole bunch of Terp sauce and very

54
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,179
little diamonds in there sometimes it's

55
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,560
hard to work with something that is all

56
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,150
Terp sauce you can't really get it on

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,930
the dabber you can't take a satisfying

58
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,908
dab of it

59
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,010
sometimes they give you a giant boulder

60
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:18,628
of the diamonds in the middle and barely

61
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,219
any Terp sauce and you need some of the

62
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:21,688
Terps I do like the diamonds the most

63
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,829
because that's the potency but I think

64
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:24,930
the Terps are important

65
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:27,510
without the Terps it's not the same so I

66
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,640
really like it when there's a good ratio

67
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:32,039
and these guys did a very good job at

68
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,328
the ratio of Terp sauce to diamonds and

69
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,608
the diamonds aren't too big or too small

70
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:37,379
so really great consistency this has

71
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:39,569
been one of my favorite concentrates

72
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,828
that I've gotten most recently so big

73
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:44,280
shout out once again to our friends at

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,359
dominant ambrosia that's a lot of words

76
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:50,459

77
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:52,799

172
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,560
it is from our friend Casey penny they

173
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,550
left it on April 18th and the review

174
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,069
goes a lot like this I go by the name of

175
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,480
Casey Benny and a recent astrological

176
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:23,819
phenomenon seems to have lined

177
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,680
everything up to make it possible for me

178
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,290
to not only come to Denver for the first

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,629
time in my life but I was also able to

180
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,629
attend the fable that dude grows cup and

181
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:34,740
meet Rasta Jeff there man I'm so glad

182
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,269
you made it that's awesome that you

183
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,400
think it was an astrological phenomenon

184
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,718
I think is just fate and the way things

185
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,428
were supposed to go

186
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:43,079
I'm glad you made it I'm glad you made

187

200
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:12,299
grow off kind of an event where a lot of

201
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,338
people came together from all over the

202
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,228

just hang out and smoke down and enjoy

206
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:24,749
the community that has been created

207
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,399
around the dude grow show so that's what

208
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:28,349
the dude grows cup was our friend was

209
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,879
able to come out and hang out and he got

210
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:32,128
to meet me there so there's more to this

211
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,989
revue it says Rasta Jeff was the coolest

212
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,879
vendor at the cup hey that means a lot

213
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:37,649
to me man thank you we did have kind of

214
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,449
a party going on at my booth the entire

215
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:41,728
time they got a little bit crowded over

216
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,499
there so that was a lot of fun I goes on

217
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:46,139
to say it seemed that the other seed

218
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:47,849
vendors were not priced with love my man

219
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,038
Jeff hooked me up with five packs of

220
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:52,378
seeds for the price of one pack from

221
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,389
some of the other guys and one pack was

222
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,959
a 10 pack because he was out of five

223
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:57,598
packs

224
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,999
I actually remember this I gave you a 10

225
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:03,449
pack of hellfire OG because I'd ran out

226
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,419
of five packs yes many of this seed

227
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,579
companies there are higher priced than

228
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,528
myself that's not a tacit anybody that's

229
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:12,179
just how it is my seed packs are more

230
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:13,889
friendly priced than many of the other

231
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:15,808
seed companies out there you'll also

232
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,189
notice that I've got a smaller crew than

233
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:18,719
everybody they've got more people to pay

234
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:20,669
for they've got more stuff to cover I

235
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:23,248
keep my overheads small that allows me

236
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:25,228
to keep my pricing down also I want

237
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:26,699
everybody to have access to quality

238
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:28,649
seeds that's part of why I started

239
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,149
breeding part of why I started putting

240
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:31,769
seeds out there I want them to be

241
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,719
affordable there's no reason why

242
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:36,058
everybody shouldn't be able to afford

243
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,649
quality seeds and that's what I offer is

244
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:40,049
a quality seed at an affordable price

245
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:42,448
it's a just as good as the other

246
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,348
expensive seeds just everybody can

247
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,878
afford it you don't have to feel like

248
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,079
you're breaking the bank you don't have

249
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,970
to feel like you're gonna go broke deep

250
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:49,888
in digging too deep into your pockets to

251
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,329
get started so I do appreciate it that

252
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:53,310
you notice that my stuff is a little bit

253
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:54,479
more affordable and yes you asked for

254
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,039
my pack is something I didn't have a

255
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,840
fiver I wanted to make sure you got the

256
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,360
seeds you needed so I gave you a 10 for

257
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,370
the price of a 5 that's what we could do

258
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,740
gotta take care of the people it goes on

259
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,690
to say they all had more than 5 in the

260
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,480
packs yes that's also something I do I

261
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,730
tend to put 6 or 7 seeds in the 5 packs

262
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,980
the 10 packs will have 12 to 14 seeds

263
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,550
and I'm quite often that's just how I do

264
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,320
it when I can he goes on to say it was

265
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:21,299
so cool to meet Jeff and the cup was the

266
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,370
best party I've been to since my wedding

267
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,079

274
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:40,649

297
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,350
another review the headline for this one

298
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,270
says Rasta Jeff and the Irie army kicks

299
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,009
butt they gave us 5 stars

300
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:34,710
this one is from a person who calls

301
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:37,500
themselves daddy-o 45 they left this

302
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:41,580
review on April 29th and the review goes

303
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,830
a lot like this that was one kick butt

304
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,509
show on autoflowering and moving plants

305
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,089
back and forth from indoors and outdoors

306
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:49,799
a lot of good information so he's

307
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,410
talking about a recent episode I did

308
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,729
where I talked about moving plants from

309
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,289
an indoor grow room putting them

310
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,639
outdoors to get some sunshine and

311
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,439
bringing them back in at the end of the

312
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,059
day to keep them in a flowering cycle I

313
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,070
kind of recommend it not to do that

314
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,139
because of the simple fact of bringing

315
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,879
bugs into the grow room so that's what

316
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,929
they're referring to there I'm glad you

317
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,360
liked that episode

318
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:12,179
I love knowing that my advice is landing

319
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,558
on somebody who is using it sometimes

320
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,938
you give out advice and you're like I

321
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:16,980
don't even know if anybody needs this

322
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:18,659
information or if anybody cares but when

323
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,100
I know it's working for you that means a

324
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:22,139
lot to me it lets me know that the

325
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,970
effort I made actually did something for

326
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,068

328
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:29,969

329
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,980
but so freeing thank you so much I

330
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,499

333
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,569
be too scared when I read your email on

334
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:40,920
there sometimes people get tripped out

335
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,688
because they put their name or whatever

336
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,669
in the email think of it this way if I

337
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:45,178
say anything about you or anything on

338
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:47,159

339
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:48,869

anybody out this email goes a lot like

459
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:42,889
this hey Jeff I love your show hey

460
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,469
thanks for listening dude the question

461
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:48,009
is can I vacuum seal my nugs after they

462
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:51,079
get to the desired ripeness in the jar

463
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:53,028
yes you can absolutely vacuum seal your

464
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:54,919
nugs once they have reached the desired

465
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:56,750
ripeness in your jar just make sure they

466
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,818
are actually the ripeness you want them

467
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,438
to be if you do seal them up and there's

468
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:02,059
too much moisture in there you do run

469
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:04,490
the risk of creating a mold problem

470
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:06,649
inside of that container it sounds like

471
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,568
you were a smart man it sounds like you

472
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:10,429
know how far to take them before you

473
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,078
seal them so as long as you get them to

474
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,878
the correct ripeness as long as you get

475
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,528
them to the correct moisture level

476
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,438
before you seal them up yes you can

477
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:20,750
absolutely vacuum seal your product so

478
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:22,909
that your nubs stay nice and fresh if

479
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,860
you're anything like me you'll probably

480
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:26,719
write the strain name and then you'll

481
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,100
probably weigh that product before you

482
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,810
vacuum seal it so you'll be able to

483
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,490
write the strain name the amount of

484
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:32,869
product and the date that it was sealed

485
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,879
up that way you have a lot of

486
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,769
information and a lot of details on that

487
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,909
