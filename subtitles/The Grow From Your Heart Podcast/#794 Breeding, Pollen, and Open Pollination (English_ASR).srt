go to iregenetics.com on the top there

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,659
are several tabs one of them says grow

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,159
questions click on there send me your

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,380
grow question if I read your grow

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,719
question on the podcast you will win a

35
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,819
free pack of seeds the first question on

36
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,039
today's show came from our friend who

37
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,839
wants to be called Johnny pot smoker big

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,100
congrats to my friend Johnny pot smoker

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,140
because you have won a free pack of

40
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,239
seeds for sending me this question this

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,280
question goes a little bit like this it

42
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,719
says hey Ross to Jeff thank you for

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,640
taking time to read this grow question

44
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,319
hey bro thank you for taking the time to

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,478
send to this grow question it goes on it

46
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,639
says can I start breeding with just

47
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,500
feminized seeds that is a really good

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,200
question a very common question I get a

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,259
lot it says I want to look into starting

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,780
a breeding project in my 2x4 tent my

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,879
issue is that my 5x5 tent shares the

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,098
same lung room should I even risk it

53
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,719
follow-up question can I take feminized

54
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,519
reverse pollen and cross it with an

55
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,259
Autoflower what would happen happy

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,819
growing from our friend Johnny pot

57
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,620
smoker this is a good series of

58
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:19,139
questions here let's jump right into

59
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,300
this you absolutely really can breed

60
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,519
with just feminized seeds that is the

61
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,140
first part of this you can use Femme

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,879
seeds for your breeding project however

63
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,738
there will not be a male in there if

64
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,598
you've got feminized seeds all of those

65
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,640
will be girls you will have to select

66
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:34,759
one of those and reverse it to use that

67
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,199
as your pollen donor or of course use

68
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,479
non-feminized seeds to find a boy to

69
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,699
breed with that plant but feminized

70
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,018
seeds work just like non-feminized seeds

71
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,359
other than the fact that you're not

72
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,700
going to get any males out of that mix

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,739
some people have a myth or an idea or a

74
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:52,079
misconception that they cannot breed to

75
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,060
a plant that came from a femme seed in

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,519
my experience those plants are great

77
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,780
let's talk about the uh I've read the

78
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,120
lemon Jeffrey which is one of my

79
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,159
favorite cuts that is a feminized plant

80
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,560
I created that I have bred that to

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,959
several other things the lemon Sunrise

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,340
is lemon Jeffrey to arise those are

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,200
great plants it brings out a lot of

84
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,000
traits from the arise a lot of traits

85
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,039
from the the lemon Jeffrey that's a

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,259
feminized to a regular and it works very

87
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,299
well so you absolutely can work your

88
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,579
Femmes into the breeding program any way

89
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,719
that you see fit the next part of the

90
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,819
question

91
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,560
um should I risk it because my uh my

92
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:28,199
five by five room and my two by four

93
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,120
share the same lung room with that lung

94
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,560
room being the commonality there I do

95
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,599
not think I would risk it because the

96
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,340
pollen will get into the air and it will

97
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,378
end up in both of those Grow rooms the

98
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,819
room you want seated uh will be fully

99
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:40,739
seated the room you don't want seated

100
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,238
will have too many seeds in it just

101
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,219
because there's no barrier there's no

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,200
there's absolutely no protection that

103
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,759
lung room is what is going to move the

104
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,798
pollen from one place to another the

105
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,479
pollen is very fine I would recommend

106
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,219
doing it a little bit further away which

107
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,859
we will touch on on another question

108
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:58,378
here in this episode so in your setup no

109
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,760
I would not even risk it because that

110
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,039
lung room is just going to move that

111
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,378
pollen right around everybody is going

112
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,019
to be pollinated so maybe you can learn

113
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:10,079
how to do the five by five room put it

114
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,819
into flower get it floured get it almost

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,500
done and then put the other room into

116
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,598
flower that way the next time you fill

117
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,918
the five by five it's only in veg and

118
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,079
then you can do your seed breeding in

119
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,478
the other room have that side flowering

120
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,460
while they're vegging then get that done

121
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,899
clean up all the pollen before these

122
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,120
plants go into flower that should work

123
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:29,159
out for you but you can't do both at the

124
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,139
same time because I do fear that you

125
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,600
will pollinate that entire room there's

126
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,579
a third part to the question it says my

127
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,740
follow-up question can I take feminized

128
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:40,379
reversed pollen and cross it with an

129
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,500
Autoflower you absolutely can what would

130
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,478
happen then you're going to make

131
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,180
feminized plants that show some traits

132
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:50,459
of Autoflower and some traits that show

133
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,780
Regular photo period plants if this is

134
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:53,339
the first time you're Crossing it to

135
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,258
that Autoflower there will be a

136
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,659
percentage I'm not in uh I'm not an

137
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,280
Autoflower breeder but there will be a

138
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,620
percentage of those plants that do come

139
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,879
out Autoflower so if you're okay with

140
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,620
having some of your Offspring be

141
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,478
Autoflower some of your Offspring be

142
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,519
regular photo period that is an

143
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,680
acceptable idea The Next Step would be

144
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,779
to cross that Autoflower to another

145
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,639
Autoflower again in the future to lock

146
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,559
in that Autoflower trait if that's the

147
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,019
route that you want to go only use

148
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,819
Autoflower if you are your main goal is

149
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,258
to make Autoflower plants because that's

150
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,240
what you're introducing into the gene

151
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,100
pool the short answer is yes you can do

152
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,319
this the long answer is only do that if

153
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,900
you intend on working that Autoflower

154
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,759
trait in and making that a stable trait

155
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,859
that pops up amongst the population so

156
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,080
uh question number one you can breed

157
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,600
with Femme seeds they are just like

158
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,399
regular seeds I would not do it in the

159
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
room with two tents because you're going

160
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,079
to get contamination and yes you can

161
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,060
breed you can use feminized reversed

162
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,579
pollen to an Autoflower and it will make

163
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,399
some plants that are Autos some plants

164
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,599
that are Rags my buddy Johnny pot smoker

165

your message here on the podcast you do

186

you do win free beans so I owe you a

187
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:42,120
pack here goes the question it says

188
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,740
let's say we take a female out of the

189
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,478
flower tan all right pulled her out of

190
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,720
the tent then we put it in a small

191
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:50,939
separate tent real real far far away and

192
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,919
pollinate it with the super dope stud so

193
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,319
far this is making sense now the

194
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,478
question is can I take that female after

195
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,580
I know it's been pollinated maybe just

196
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,318
blow it off a bit stick it back in the

197
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,620
flower tent and expect everything to be

198
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,960
just peachy or will residual pollen be

199
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,060
left on the plant and that pollen

200
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,978
fertilize the other females that is a

201
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,639
very good question

202
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:16,318
if if this is done correctly it will

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,960
work the way that you want it to but

204
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,720
keep in mind that pollen is microscopic

205
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,758
uh the pollen that got on that plant got

206
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,500
in your hair and your clothes and your

207
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,060
dreadlocks if you got dreadlocks it's in

208
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,459
your eyelashes it's in your eyebrows

209
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,959
it's in your hoodie it's everywhere so

210
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,019
we've got to get rid of that pollen

211
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,359
before we return to the sensimillia room

212
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:38,519
with no seeds in it so the main way that

213
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,680
I would recommend doing that the main

214
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,258
key to deactivating pollen is water

215
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,060
water deactivates pollen so I would

216
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,680
pollinate that plant in that other room

217
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,180
leave it there for a couple of days I

218
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,519
pollinate twice I just like to hit the

219
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,199
plant two times I just ensures that I'm

220
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,000
going to get full pollination lots of

221
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,919
seeds so I would do my pollination

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,019
process however you do that however I do

223
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,478
it put the plant uh you said Far Far

224
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,698
Away real real far far away we got two

225
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,139
reels and two fars so we're real real

226
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,598
far far away we're gonna put the female

227
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,620
in there we're going to pollinate I

228
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:09,060
would wait a couple days I would

229
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,978
pollinate again then I would wait a

230
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,478
couple of days then like you said blow

231
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:13,918
off all that pollen if you've got a way

232
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,439
to dust off all that pollen that is

233
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,779
ideal get rid of that then I would take

234
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,360
a bottle of just water and mist my plant

235
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,859
with water completely I would almost

236
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,879
drench that plant to where it's running

237
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,400
off

238
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,900
that water is going to deactivate and

239
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,519
kill any of the pollen that is left on

240
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,739
the plant but it will not damage our

241
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,778
seeds or the plant cannabis plants are

242
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,639
designed by nature to be outside part of

243
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:37,740
the trichomes purpose is to protect that

244
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,658
plant from rain and moisture and water

245
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,219
the plant will be just fine if you

246
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,200
drench it down one time don't leave it

247
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,060
locked in a room and get stagnant with

248
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,440
no air but let's spray it down one time

249
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,239
leave the fans on and that will help

250
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,980
deactivate the pollen and he won't get

251
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,600
any mold you won't get any problems then

252
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,060
when you're ready to move that plant

253
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,379
after it's been sprayed down also spray

254
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:56,939
yourself down change your clothes if

255
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,679
you've got dreadlocks like I do wrap

256
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,720
them up when you're doing this or water

257
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,979
them down spray them make sure you be

258
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,259
very careful because pollen is

259
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,300
microscopic and every little granule of

260
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,700
pollen can equal one seed in the flower

261
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:10,500
room so be very careful so we've watered

262
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,360
down the Plant spray down everything

263
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,799
wipe down the pot wipe down everything

264
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,720
that was in the room with the pollen

265
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,819
including yourself take a shower scrub

266
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,740
down get all that pollen off of you now

267
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,778
at this time when I'm taking that female

268
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,519
plant into the general population with

269
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,620
the other females I would go in that

270
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,299
room and I I would also spray down all

271
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,399
of those females just give them one good

272
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,259
dusting with water that way they're not

273
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,940
able to receive any stray pollen that

274
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,439
may be in the room then just go in there

275
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,240
and move that plant in there and just do

276
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,860
just a random willy-nilly spray just

277
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,360
coat everything with water that way if

278
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,159
there is any pollen that made it in

279
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,419
there that is floating around we've

280
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,740
sprayed it once in this room we've

281
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:45,539
treated ourselves we've brought it to

282
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,799
the room we treated the females now

283
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:48,659
we're treating everything in the room

284
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,179
let's just triple check and make sure no

285
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:53,699
pollen gets into the room so if you do

286
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:56,458
this correctly everything should be

287
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,620
peachy like you said but the residual

288
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,719
pollen that could be left over will

289
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,339
pollinate all of the pistols that it

290
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,379
comes in contact with so make sure that

291
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,839
you do get every bit of pollen either

292
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,580
off of that plant and or deactivate it I

293
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,140
don't trust I've seen people take an air

294
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,700
compressor and just blow the pollen off

295
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,679
I don't trust that I don't for some

296
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,620
reason I don't think that's good enough

297
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,239
I want some water in the mix as well so

298
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,339
get some water in there spray those

299
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,759
plants down water is the deactivator of

300
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,860
pollen that should rescue you I don't

301
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,899
want to be responsible if you try this

302
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,360
and it does not go wrong I'm telling you

303
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,860
pollen is crazy pollen travels in the

304
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,440
air pollen will get stuck in your nose

305
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,940
and then you'll sneeze it back out later

306
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,220
pollen is microscopic so keep that in

307
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,899
mind and it moves very freely through

308
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,759
the air if you dust a plant if you shake

309
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,440
a plant making pollen watch how that

310
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,639
pollen just lingers in the air some of

311
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,620
the smaller pieces will just stick

312
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,000
around in there they'll be there for a

313
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,220
long time much longer than you

314
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
anticipate so take good care of the

315
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,720
pollen be really careful and it should

316
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,120
be peachy but it is very possible that

317
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,100
you will pollinate the entire [ __ ]

318
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,778
room so be very careful all right my

319

friend shiggy smacks thank you for the

320

dog [ __ ] dog please make sure to send

328
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:19,319
me your address because I do owe you a

329
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,760
pack of irie genetic seeds of course

330
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,160
those seeds are sponsored by our friends

331
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,319
at seeds here now.com big thanks to them

332
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,899
for hosting and promoting and sponsoring

333
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,519
a seed giveaway here on the show this

334
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,100
question says I have a general grow

335
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,139
question my plan is to grow a pack of

336
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,420
Jack Tripper and do an open pollination

337
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,980
with all of the plants no individual

338
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:40,199
selection and then it says I know I

339
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,759
won't know the baby daddy that's fine if

340
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,339
you are doing an open pollination to

341
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,958
make f2s that's that's a great way to do

342
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,339
it you're going to make a lot of seeds

343
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,719
and you're going to see a lot of

344
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,760
diversity here you're going to see all

345
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,500
the phenotypical expressions and you

346
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,958
will find what you want in that F2

347
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,820
population by doing this it says

348
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,159
um I want to no individual selection

349
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,200
then hunt the highest potency of the

350
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,419
female to find High potency mail to

351
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,940
further breed with that's a really good

352
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,679
strategy but don't get too hung up on

353
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,200
the idea that potency is the only thing

354
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,359
you're looking for we need structure we

355
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,000
need plant Vigor we need resistance to

356
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,919
pathogens we need resistance to any kind

357
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,539
of bugs we also need to make sure that

358
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,000
there's no intersex problem in these

359
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,860
plants so don't stay too focused on just

360
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,600
potency there are a lot of other factors

361
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,278
that should help you determine if this

362
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,620
plan is worth growing let's continue

363
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,078
though so the question I have is have

364
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,959
you ever seen intersex traits on a

365
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:36,359
female after it has received pollen

366
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,819
um no I've never seen a plant that has

367
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,560
received pollen show me intersex traits

368
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,660
but most of the time when I'm working

369
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,338
with plants I've grown them multiple

370
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,500
times before I choose to breed with them

371
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,120
so I know that that intersex is not

372
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,159
going to pop up before or after

373
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,959
pollination so there's a little bit of a

374
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,278
vetting process to be done before I

375
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,018
generally breed it sounds like you're

376
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,458
going to take these Jack Trippers and

377
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,379
just go for it which sounds like a fun

378
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,299
project I have no uh you won't see

379
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:02,039
intersex traits in those Jack Trippers

380
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,838
I've never seen that nobody out there

381
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:05,819
has ever reported an intersex problem

382
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,680
with the Jack Trippers so I recommend

383
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,778
you do it you won't see any intersex

384
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,219
traits pop up in there but we'll stick

385
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:13,620
with the question have you ever seen

386
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,480
intersex traits on a female after it has

387
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,000
received pollen no I've never seen that

388
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,220
before or is that more common in Scentsy

389
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,778
but yes that is totally more common in

390
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,100
Scentsy but something happens with the

391
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,379
hormones once that plan has been

392
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,778
pollinated it's very unlikely to show

393
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,759
intersex traits in my experience uh

394
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:31,019
that's my opinion that's what I think I

395
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,159
don't know if I have any science behind

396
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,740
that

397
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,019
um it says I am just planning to do the

398
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,459
F2 then select a male I figured if I did

399
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,799
it this way I'm kind of mixing up the

400
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,899
breeding pot a little bro you are uh

401
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,159
shaking the breeding uh Lottery you're

402
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,259
getting everything that you could

403
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,879
possibly pull every phenotype imaginable

404
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,039
because you're not going to call any

405
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,019
phenotypes either male or female so

406
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,879
you've got the tall skinny one the short

407
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,440
squatty one the one that smells like

408
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,639
lemons the one that smells like dryer

409
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,680
sheets the one that smells a little bit

410
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,539
like piss uh the one that smells like

411
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,099
lavender the one that is real tall and

412
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,539
skinny the one that's super high potency

413
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,278
you're going to find all of those

414
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,519
phenotypes maybe different combinations

415
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,019
of those phenotypes by mixing up that uh

416
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,879
open pollination should we talk about

417
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,159
open pollination for a second we will

418
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,958
let me keep going so he does go on he

419
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,958
says by adding in the Pandora's box of

420
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:21,659
F2 I hope to find a Jack Tripper F2 male

421
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,799
that carries on a rocket ship potency

422
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:24,419
um yes that is a really good idea and

423
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,099
then he says I'm two years out ladies

424
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:27,419
first so he's going to final hunt the

425
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,379
ladies first which sounds like a really

426
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:30,719
good he's going to do the open

427
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,519
pollination grow some find the ladies

428
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,320
then look for a male with that rocket

429
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,360
potency that is a good strategy I like

430
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,740
this idea this is going to be fun when

431
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,778
you're ready bro I'd love to run a 10

432
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,820
maybe a 20 pack of these I'm in Colorado

433
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,320
so I will run 12 of them because that is

434
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,420
my legal limit but I would love to run a

435
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,160
few of these uh see what you've attitude

436
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,899
from my creation that's always fun to

437
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,819
see especially because now let's talk

438
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,220
about I said open pollination I usually

439
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,019
do not practice the open pollination

440
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,839
sort of technique I'm a very selective

441
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,159
type of breeder open pollination I may

442
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,139
have kind of touched on it a moment ago

443
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,539
that is when uh this person is going to

444
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,060
put an entire pack of Jack Tripper seeds

445
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,338
in a room and not select any boys not

446
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,319
select any girls but just let the pollen

447
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,420
fly there will probably be somewhere

448
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,399
between four and six boys and four and

449
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,719
six girls so we're gonna have I'm just

450
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,339
gonna say five and five because it makes

451
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,259
it easy to remember and balance we're

452
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,240
gonna have five male plants putting

453
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,278
pollen on five different girl plants but

454
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,560
it's not going to be male 1 to mail two

455
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,059
to a male L2 to mail 2 or however I said

456
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,919
that it's not going to be plan a and

457
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,899
plant a and plant B and plant B it's

458
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,479
going to be all of the mixes of those

459
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:36,000
male number a is going to pollinate

460
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,519
plant number one two three four and five

461
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,559
but also on the same plant will be seeds

462
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,899
that were made with the pollen from male

463
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,698
number two also on the same plant will

464
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,740
be seeds made from male number three so

465
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,719
we're gonna have five female plants with

466
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,220
five different baby daddy seeds in all

467
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,680
of them you're gonna see what is that

468
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,699
250 000 different combinations is the

469
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,319
way that I think there might be more

470
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:56,879
zeros on that

471
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,139
um there might be two million five

472
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,879
hundred thousand different combinations

473
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,959
that you go I'm gonna stick with the 250

474
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,639
000. it's got a lot of different

475
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,379
combinations of phenotypical expression

476
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,698
you could really come up with this way

477
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,320
so that's going to be a really fun

478
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,539
project that is open pollination you

479
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,860
guys when you open some seeds and just

480
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,778
put them all in the room and just let

481
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,360
them have a big uh big old orgy in there

482
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,338
no selection uh no elimination no

483
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,379
calling uh just letting it happen the

484
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,300
way that nature would do it that puts

485
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,679
off a lot of amazing interesting

486
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:24,539
phenotypes and it sounds like our friend

487
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,638
understands that they're going to open a

488
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:28,078
Pandora's Box and then from there they

489
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,000
will select their winners for their next

490
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,620
breeding project great strategy it

491
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,299
sounds like you're doing everything that

492
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,399
you should be doing and no I have not I

493
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:37,500
think the main question was if I've seen

494
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,940
the intersex traits on a plant that has

495
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,039
been pollinated no that's something I've

496
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,600
never seen and I've never seen intersex

497
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,698
and the Jack Tripper so you were off to

498
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,139
a very good start all right let's keep

499
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:47,578
the show moving I do have one more

500
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,680
question here in front of me this one

501
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:51,120
came from our friend Smurf groan of

502
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,278
course this did come from the grow help

503
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,019
tab on the irie genetics website so that

504
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,659
means that our friends Smurf groan wins

505
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,159
a free pack of irie genetic seeds Smurf

506
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,078
please do send me your address I will

507
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,059
get some seeds in the mail to you as

508
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,279
soon as possible and just a quick heads

509
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,720
up if you have won seeds if you've sent

510
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,879
me your address at this point in time

511
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,679
all of the seed winners are in the mail

512
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,600
if you have won seeds and you have not

513
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,740
sent me your address please send me your

514
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,879
address if you've already sent it and

515
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,919
you haven't gotten your seeds feel free

516
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,179
to send it again I will do my best to

517
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,640
get those seeds out to you and don't

518
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,620
worry I do verify that your question was

519
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,540
on the show before I send you seeds

520
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,279
don't try to scan I mean I'm paying

521
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,078
attention let's keep moving this one

522
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,480
says hey there roster Jeff in one of

523
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,639
your episodes you say an S1 is when you

524
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,220
take two clones of the same plant and

525
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,200
reverse one and pollinate the other can

526
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,538
the Reversed plant pollinate itself and

527
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,038
is this considered an S1 as well thank

528
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:43,619
you and keep the great knowledge coming

529
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,720
yes that is absolutely an S1 as well

530
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:47,519
that's the same thing the reason I don't

531
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,798
recommend or prefer that is because when

532
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,379
it comes to reversing a plant I like to

533
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,700
put the Reversed plant into flower a

534
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,140
little bit sooner than the plant that

535
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,779
will receive pollen that is just a

536
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,220
timing issue you have to start spraying

537
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,500
the plant two weeks before you put it

538
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,298
the pollen donor needs to be sprayed two

539
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,919
weeks before it goes two weeks to ten

540
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:07,619
days before it goes into flour so I need

541
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,200
to spray that at one time then I need to

542
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,699
put that plant into flour in seven to

543
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,340
ten days from the first spray then it

544
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,620
needs to be sprayed every third day for

545
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:20,339
the next about 21 to 24 days it's gonna

546
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:21,959
get about seven to ten total sprays then

547
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,879
um at some point I need to put my female

548
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,620
plants into flour to catch up with with

549
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,480
that male plant so the pollen comes out

550
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:29,579
at the right time when the pistols are

551
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,960
ripe on the female plant the reason I

552
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:33,178
don't prefer to do this to the same

553
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,220
plant is because those pistols and that

554
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:38,160
pollen don't time up as good as they

555
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,380
could if I wait to put my female plants

556
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,440
into flower when I see that male plant

557
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,760
just showing signs of being reversed I

558
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,440
know what a female plant looks like when

559
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,240
it begins to flower there's a little

560
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,919
variation when the reversal was

561
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,359
successful it'll start where the plant

562
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,799
will start to make a bud it makes it

563
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,178
just a little just a little thing that

564
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,980
looks different it's a nub and it's

565
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,380
going to be an anther eventually but I

566
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,360
can identify it soon as soon as I see

567
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,980
those that's when the female plant goes

568
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:03,839
into flower that way the pollen comes

569
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,339
out at the right time when the pistols

570
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,439
are ripe on the female plant to receive

571
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,599
that pollen if I were to do it on the

572
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,400
same plant the pollen will come out way

573
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,740
too early and the pistols won't be ripe

574
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,820
enough or the pistols will be over ripe

575
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,500
and the pollen won't come out soon

576
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:19,139
enough it's just plant dependent strain

577
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,298
dependent some plants really want pollen

578
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,919
earlier some plants want pollen a lot

579
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:24,720
later in the game

580
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,759
two plants to make a really good example

581
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,679
of that situation are the strawberry

582
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,599
fields which makes strawberry Starburst

583
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,059
and the Platinum Tangy which makes the

584
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,219
sun kiss also makes the orange gasm but

585
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,899
that's a whole other story those plants

586
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,839
they want pollinate completely different

587
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,720
times about a week apart the Platinum

588
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:45,119
Tangy is ready for pollen super early

589
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,400
she's like hey Paul and Amy Here I Am

590
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,319
the Strawberry Fields plant is standing

591
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,519
in the room going [ __ ] you early and

592
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,439
she's just looking like I'm gonna wait

593
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,298
for the good pollen so that strawberry

594
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,220
Starburst plant is a full week behind

595
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:57,779
the Platinum Tangy for when it wants

596
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,000
pollen it's just sitting back waiting it

597
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,558
gets bigger it keeps on growing uh it's

598
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,538
still developing it's still booming it's

599
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:06,058
still developing like a plant should but

600
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:07,740
those pistols those uh sexual organs of

601
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:09,899
that plant are just not ready to receive

602
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,460
the pollen yet so uh the reason that I

603
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,440
do my plants separately the reason that

604
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,819
I time the plant separately is just to

605
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,220
get them into the room at the

606
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:19,019
appropriate time if this is your first

607
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,298
attempt at doing any breeding if this is

608
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:23,038
your first attempt at making seeds this

609
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:25,500
will work for you you won't make as many

610
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,460
seeds as you could if you did this to

611
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,960
two different plants you could

612
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,880
definitely make more seeds think about

613
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,558
you're reversing one side and not

614
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,960
reversing the other you're gonna have to

615
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,639
spray a couple of branches or one branch

616
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,798
of a plant very frequently and make sure

617
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,120
not to spray the other branches of that

618
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:41,579
plant because the one you spray will

619
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,619
will reverse some plants are very

620
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:45,779
stubborn some plants if you don't spray

621
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,159
the whole thing it won't reverse the

622
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:49,558
hormones over here tell the hormones

623
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,120
over here nah and they just they argue

624
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,038
about it one this one will reverse

625
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,079
halfway this one will flower halfway

626
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,339
both sides will look like [ __ ] so

627
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,659
sometimes you'll be trying to reverse

628
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,519
the right side of the plant and keep the

629
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,779
left side of the plant non-reversed and

630
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,400
the plant just doesn't want to do that

631
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:04,379
the hormones are just not allowing that

632
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,480
to happen in the plant sometimes it's a

633
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,580
more sativa dominant tropical type of a

634
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,380
plant that that'll happen to sometimes

635
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:12,599
some of the OG cush dye plants don't

636
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,340
even want to reverse at all some plants

637
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,859
are stubborn some are not that's why

638
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,659
it's much easier to have an individual

639
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,699
isolated plant that you are attempting

640
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,860
to reverse then you can reverse that

641
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,360
plant you can get it into flour and

642
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:26,279
since I understand when my plants go

643
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,899
into flower and when they want pollen I

644
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,940
could get that male into the flower room

645
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,620
get him flowering then I could drag in

646
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,600
that strawberry Starburst plant and get

647
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,979
her a head start then a few days later I

648
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,599
could bring in the Platinum Tangy plant

649
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,700
get them right on schedule then when the

650
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,798
pollen comes both of those plants are

651
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,140
going to produce maximum amount of seeds

652
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,879
for me so your idea will work if it's

653
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,860
your first idea your first attempt you

654
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,299
will bang out some seeds as long as the

655
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:50,639
one side reverses and the other side

656
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:52,200
stays true you'll be okay sometimes that

657
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,538
doesn't work out that is plant specific

658
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,120
but it should work for you in most cases

659
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:58,619
however I do recommend two separate

660
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,139
plants however the main question was

661
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:03,239
will this still be an S1 yes this is

662
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,400
absolutely still an S1 we've taken

663
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,259
pollen from a specific cultivar and

664
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,538
we've pollinated that specific cultivar

665
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,640
with that pollen it's unadulterated it's

666
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:15,240
female pollen it's a female plant that

667
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,460
is a feminized S1 seed congratulations

668
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,140
if you do this let me know how it goes

669
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,940
let me know how you decided to do it did

670
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,919
you stick with one plant being the

671
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,840
pollen donor and the pollen Giver or did

672
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,280
you decide to use two plants how many

673
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,079
female plants did you put in the room

674
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,058
and then my overall question is going to

675
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,220
be how many seeds did you get have you

676
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,599
grown them and what are they like all

677
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,860
