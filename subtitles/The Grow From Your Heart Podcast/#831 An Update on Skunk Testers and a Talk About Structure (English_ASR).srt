00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:50,119
mailing list service many of you are a

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,479

63
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,199
lately I've been sending a lot I do know

64
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,560
but I did have to change my mailing

65
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,199
service something went wrong with the

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,199
service I was using honestly they said I

67
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,479
violated terms of service I'm in

68
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,839
communication with them trying to get

69
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,878
that account back but you guys don't

70
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,039
care about that the point is I had to

71
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:14,318
update my mailing list service so if

72
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,959
you're getting an email uh that does not

73
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,439
look like the old emails I sent it's

74
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,640
because they changed my format I had to

75
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,239
change formats I'm not used to it yet

76
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,679
I'm learning it but I'm trying to get

77
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,599
the old account back my point is if

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,360
you're getting emails from IE genetics

79
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,280
that don't look the same those are from

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,239
me uh it's a new service it's a new

81
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,759
format I had to switch it up I'm trying

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
to go back to MailChimp we are in talks

83
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,878
we'll see if she'll take me back anyway

84
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,318
if you're getting those emails that is

85
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:38,759
me somebody said hey is this really you

86
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,079

sending a couple of new emails by the

91
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,199
time this comes out you'll probably get

92
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,200

103

there's a business um purpose and a

104
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,798
business method for all of that the

105

Trent Gil big shout out to my new friend

181
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,598
Trent Gil Trent's question goes a little

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,120
bit just like this it says yo roster

183
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,680
Jeff sorry to be a pest no pesting at

184
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,079
all I get a lot of emails I try to

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,478
answer most of them or reply somehow

186
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,279
I apologize if I don't get to all of

187
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,598
them you are not bugging me uh keep

188
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,000
sending those emails it says I'm still

189
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,000
curious what's the difference between

190
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,959
the 9s and the iy skunk I've already

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,560
ordered a pack of the '90s skunk but I'm

192
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,560
thinking about adding on a pack of the

193
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,038
iie if that is possible uh then here's a

194
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,160
part that is kind of a conversation but

195
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,519
I'm going to address this here just

196
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,199
because I've got the opportunity on the

197
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,240
podcast it says I don't know if I can

198
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,840
venmo the cash or cash app or send the

199
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,720
money I just don't want to pay shipping

200
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,598
twice um that is a really good idea I

201
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,080
wish that I could do that but um it's

202
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,038
not just a Onan kind of a me and you

203
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,839
doing a deal operation sort of a thing

204
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,120
anymore uh there's a shipping app

205
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,638
there's a website it's all got to go

206
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,840
through that website it's all got to be

207
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,960
official uh once the order is in I can't

208
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,359
really amend the orders sometimes people

209
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,158
will send me an email saying hey you're

210
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,158
going to send me a pack of 4K freebies

211
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,399
can you swap that out with this and

212
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:54,639
unfortunately I can't do it the the

213
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,638
amount of orders that I'm getting uh are

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,400
overwhelming and I can't keep tabs of

215
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,960
all the switches all the substitutions

216
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,399
it's just not possible

217
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,638
the way that the system is set up there

218
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,079
will be mistakes if I do that and I

219
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,800
finally got the system figured out to

220
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,878
where there are minimal mistakes I'm not

221
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,639
going to say we don't make mistakes uh

222
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,120
but everybody's trained well everybody

223
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
knows their role in the packaging and

224
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,478
sending part of the deal now and so

225
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,878
we're not making as many mistakes if I

226
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,519
were to uh take a cash app or a venmo

227
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,560
from you I would have to figure out

228
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,639
where that order goes it's just a I know

229
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,000
it sounds stupid but it's just another

230
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,879
it's all on the website it's all done

231
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,360
that way for a reason the orders all go

232
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,080
to ship station uh all the packaging

233
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,639
have help shipping them honestly and the

234
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,000
people helping me ship have to see it in

235
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,399
ship station it's got to go that way uh

236
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,839
I know it sounds stubborn but it's a

237
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,278
business that's the way we're running in

238
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,719
that's the way it's working uh there

239
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,559
aren't mistakes right now and that's

240
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,720
what matters the most uh shout out to

241
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,919
the people that help me also um where

242
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,879
were we can I send you venmo cash app

243
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,360
unfortunately that's not an option I

244
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,679
just don't want to pay shipping twice I

245
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,959
understand that but uh I'm going to give

246
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,479
you a free pack of seeds here so you

247
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,879
won't have to pay shipping twice and

248
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,200
you're going to get some free seeds it

249
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,720
says um is one of and then we're going

250
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,000
to get he goes back to talking about the

251
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,959
skunk testers here so we're just going

252
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,200
to say is one of the skunk testers more

253
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,278
indical leaning or more sativa does the

254
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,680
I skunk involve your Lemon Skunk is

255
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,958
there something different bread to it

256
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,000
and then it says I love some good skunk

257
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,359
um then he wraps it up with the stink is

258
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,559
just a bonus and then he says Uh there's

259
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
some more stuff here but I don't need to

260
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,719
read all this it says thanks man hope

261
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,560
you have an awesome day from Trent hey

262
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Trent thank you for the great question I

263
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,919
do have some answers but honestly I'm

264
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,240
going to be quite vague when it comes to

265
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,759
talking about testers I try not to give

266
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,120
you too many details because that will

267
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,078
bias or sway your testing right now

268
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,320
you've got some seeds and you don't know

269
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,278
what to expect other than the hopes of

270
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,879
skunk and that I've told you guys it

271
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,200
takes about 9 to 10 weeks for these to

272
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,278
flower CU I want you to finish them out

273
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,278
on time and let them do the right

274
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,679
flowering time but that's about all the

275
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,838
details I really want to give so I try

276
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,479
not to give you guys too much

277
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,360
information about the testers because I

278
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,360
don't want to bias or sway your testing

279
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
I know what I've seen uh from these

280
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,039
plants and I'm not too far ahead of you

281
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,679
guys and the testing honestly um I'm

282
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,559
having fun with them just like you guys

283
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,239
but uh I know what I'm seeing from the

284
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,319
phenotypes I know what I'm looking for I

285
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,919
know what I want to see if you guys

286
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,640
discover in those phenotypes and what

287
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,319
you pull out I want to see if you're

288
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,120
seeing the same things as me if you're

289
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,278
discovering the same things I do or if

290
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,159
you're getting different things in

291
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,919
different rooms and I don't want to give

292
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,838
you too many ideas because if I say one

293
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,679
does this or one does this you'll be

294
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,800
looking for that and it puts a fixation

295
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,479
on things and it creates bias within the

296
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,719
testing this is like a blind study uh I

297
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,360
know the seeds are good I know they're

298
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,200
not intersects I know they germ well I

299
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,000
know they're quality but I'm looking for

300
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,680
certain specific traits to see what you

301
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,278
guys get uh just for documentation and

302
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,838
then for advertising a lot also but uh

303
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,278
you guys are going to discover a lot of

304
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,079
that so when it comes to the testers I

305
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,480
don't give out a lot of information I've

306
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,879
got notes here to keep me on track cuz

307
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,079
I'm highest draft [ __ ] to be honest to

308
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,200
you guys odd said I can't tell you too

309
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:57,039
much because it will bias your testing I

310
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,399
used uh skunk so these came from how

311
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,679
much information do I want to give you

312
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,679
these came from two different batches of

313
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,759
skunk number one seeds so there's seeds

314
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,078
of skunk number one from two different

315
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,240
batches uh there's also the skunk number

316
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,879
one clone and there is another batch of

317
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,720
seeds that we played with and grew some

318
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,159
skunks out of but that didn't make it to

319
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,399
this round of breeding so what I can

320
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,639
tell you is one is uh they're both skunk

321
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,360
number ones but when we did the feno

322
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,759
hunting my myself and another friend of

323
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,039
mine went through these plants and grew

324
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,639
them and smoked them and uh scrutinized

325
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,639
these plants and any of the skunk number

326
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,000
one seeds that we started with if it had

327
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,680
that sweet or that cinnamon some had

328
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,039
cinnamon if it had sweet or like

329
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,199
seasoning sort of smells it went away

330
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,480
the only things that passed through uh

331
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,000
our rigorous um the casting couch the

332
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,759
fenal hunts were the ridiculous rotten

333
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,078
skunk I don't want to share too much

334
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,078
because like I said it's going to sway

335
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:56,239
your testing but they are both from

336
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,799
skunk number one seed stock and they are

337
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,120
skunky that's none of the sweet [ __ ]

338
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,838
it's none of the candy [ __ ] I focused on

339
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,278
straight skunk I want to elaborate so I

340
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,880
need to get away from this topic before

341
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,559
I tell you way too much because I feel

342
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,320
like I've already told you enough

343
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,719
honestly um we use skunks I tossed

344
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,600
anything sweet there are two different

345
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,120
skunk number one phenotypes it came from

346
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,199
seed plus the skunk number one clone the

347
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,639
original OG clone is in the breeding but

348
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,838
you guys aren't getting that yet that's

349
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,000
not in this batch which means that there

350
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,800
are more skunk crosses coming what so

351
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,679
once you guys test these there will be

352
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:32,559
more skunk there's a skunk uh number one

353
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,479
uh S1 from that there are um there's

354
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,439
possibly Mel Frank sturban poison to

355
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,240
skunk number one I've already said too

356
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,440
much but um that's as much as I could

357
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,959
tell you right now I know I just rambled

358
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,160
a long time about that skunk and I can't

359
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,399
give you too much info because I don't

360
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,240
want to sway your testing um you're

361
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,078
talking about buying another pack I

362
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,240
highly recommend that I would love to

363
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,000
see what happens if you ran both packs

364
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,198
under the same environment right next to

365
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,519
each other that's really what I'm

366
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:58,198
looking for um that would tell me a lot

367
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,039
of stuff that would help me continue my

368
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:02,479
breeding that's kind of what we're doing

369
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:05,078
here so yeah run them both if you can

370
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,639
and um here's a good update those skunks

371
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:08,479

now but by the time this episode comes

373
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,079

we're going to keep this show moving

391
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,919
I've got another great question here

392
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,560
this one has been coming up quite a bit

393
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,479
so I figured it was time to answer this

394
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,919
this question came from my good friend

395
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,079
Dylan I've been talking to Dylan on

396
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,278
Facebook for a long time what's up dude

397
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,799
Dylan sent this question on the growel

398
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:00,679
tab on the iy genetics website so that

399
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,198
means that Dylan you want a free pack of

400
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,198
seeds from

401
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,240
redirect.sh Yo Rasta Jeff what's up dude

402
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,959
says I have a question about the

403
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,399
structural terms of the cannabis plant

404
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,919
on your descriptions of your awesome

405
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:19,759
strains it mentions the term more open

406
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,479
structured plants I was hoping you could

407
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,759
elaborate a bit on what that means and

408
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,000
what to expect from that I'm currently

409
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,560
waiting for scarlet Bonas Redline

410
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,120
Morning Dew and candylicious and I can't

411
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,239
wait for that run to get started BR

412
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,639
classic uh Redline is going to be a

416
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,399

428
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,838
all of your excellent Creations I love I

429
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,560
genetics well Dylan we love you back bro

430
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,519
uh thank you for the great message now

431
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,919
this is a really good question uh Dylan

432
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,519
is asking about the terms I am using

433
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,360
when I talk about the structure of the

434
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,959
plants and since he listed four plants

435
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,879
here before I get into my notes that I

436
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,638
made my little chart that I wrote about

437
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,320
structure I'm going to address the four

438
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,320
plants he's talking about Scarlet Bonas

439
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,920
um so if I was talking about structures

440
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,278
of plants it's just like talking about

441
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,439
like if you looked at people or if you

442
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,559
looked at trees like I'm tall and skinny

443
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,000
and lanky that's a way to describe me uh

444
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,479
if somebody was built different than me

445
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,399
you could say that they were short and

446
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,600
Pudgy or thick might be the word or just

447
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,159
different that's what I'm doing with the

448
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,159
cannabis plants I'm finding words that

449
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,559
apply to the shape and structure of the

450
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,360
plant that I think would translate to

451
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,159
most people so if we're going to talk

452
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,879
about Scarlet Bonas Scarlett Bonas is

453
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,399
built mostly a lot of the phenotypes are

454
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,480
built like me tall lanky kind of

455
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,198
stretchy kind of skinny uh they're going

456
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,278
to stretch out a lot in flowers so I

457
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:00,240
would call that a tall stretchy branchy

458
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,480
kind of plan I'm tall lanky and stretchy

459
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,959
and branchy myself so I can say that

460
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Redline uh red line is a little bit more

461
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,679
bushy which bushy right you can now that

462
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,639
I'm giving you some descriptors to

463
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,758
compare it to Bushy it bushes out just a

464
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,919
little bit more the Scarlet Bonas goes

465
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,278
up up up and out a little bit the red

466
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:19,120
line goes out quite a bit and not up as

467
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,480
vigorously so now we're starting to

468
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,480
figure out the different the ways I'm

469
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,399
applying these words Morning Dew Morning

470
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,839
Dew uh she will grow kind of wide kind

471
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,120
of bushy but also she'll get a nice IAL

472
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,360
dominant top uh she has that open

473
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,879
structure I'm talking about um if you

474
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,680
look at the the red line she's bushy and

475
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:39,000
messy on the inside all the branches

476
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,958
that come up are making a bunch of

477
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,559
leaves it's all tight together in there

478
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,278
it's just messy on the inside you got to

479
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,318
get in there and clean that [ __ ] up the

480
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:47,559
morning do is a little bit more open to

481
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:49,838
where when you get in there to work with

482
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,719
it the branches aren't so claustrophobic

483
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,040
on the inside it's more open it's kind

484
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,199
of widened up it's self uh open is the

485
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,078
word for it more air flow less uh

486
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:00,479
nonsensical branching down at the bottom

487
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,239
less unnecessary leafing so that's the

488
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,838
open uh more branchy bushy structure

489
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,400
from The Morning Dew now candylicious uh

490
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,480
cand delicious has some phenotypes to

491
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,919
get pretty tall but also it's got a lot

492
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,000
of branching vit so now here's another

493
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,439
descriptor I talk about sometimes the

494
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,880
branches of the plants will um they'll

495
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,839
come out and they'll curve up and those

496
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,199
branches usually you'll notice reach the

497
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,519
top of the plant they try to make an

498
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,798
even canopy a lot of plants will shoot

499
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:29,639
branches that just go at an angle like a

500
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,240
45° I think it is about 45 yeah and just

501
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,960
go shoot shoot shoot and they'll just

502
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,640
come straight off and those will get

503
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
kind of messy sometimes you'll notice

504
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,000
that all that [ __ ] gets confused in

505
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,759
there that's a tighter more narrow more

506
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,160
closed up plant you may see that from

507
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,519
the uh the

508
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,120
candylicious so and that part comes from

509
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,639
the the Afterglow the Afterglow makes it

510
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,119
grow messy so those are just quick ways

511
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,559
to describe the four plants that you've

512
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,079
got now I do have a little flowchart

513
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:56,000
that I made here for myself I guess I

514
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,599
could call it um to talk about structure

515
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,960
um the first thing that we usually talk

516
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,359
about is frame and shape that's what

517
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,038
I've been focused on mostly here to

518
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,359
start um frame and shape things that I

519
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:07,480
would use to describe the frame and

520
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,879
shape are words like a tight structure a

521
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,480
tight frame an open frame but so let me

522
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,200
talk about a tight frame so some plants

523
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,120
will grow uh you get here I'm going to

524
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,440
use my arm is the main stock so some

525
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,158
plants you'll have a branch coming a

526
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,480
pair of branches coming here and then a

527
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:22,120
pair of branches coming here that's

528
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,919
about three or four inches apart and

529
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,199
then sometimes they'll be 8 to 10 in

530
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,840
apart if I say tight that means they're

531
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,519
closer together all the structure is

532
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,759
just tighter more compact um I would say

533
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,759
orange gasm compared to a rise orange

534
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,119
gasm is a tighter Golden Goat is a much

535
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,440
tighter plant compared to a rise a rise

536
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,199
just spreads itself out mansplains or

537
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,159
man spreads takes up all the room on the

538
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,798
bus where [ __ ] Golden Goat stays a

539
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,520
little bit tighter keeps into its own

540
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,599
space a little bit better so that's a

541
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,960
tight structure that open structure is

542
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,599
the next word on my list um those are

543
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,960
the plants where they're more open on

544
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,158
the bottom and they just spread out on

545
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,120
their own a little bit the branches

546
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,039
aren't touching and everything's growing

547
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,678
together it's just more open if you drew

548
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,240
a silhouette of it you could kind of see

549
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,600
some space of the background through it

550
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,079
it's not just a big bushy messy plant

551
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,079
the next word I've got is stretchy um

552
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,000
I've mentioned aise arise can be a tall

553
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,879
stretchy plant Jack Tripper can be a

554
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,919
tall stretchy plant it makes that

555
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,799
fishing pole in the middle that Long

556
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,159
Tall fishing pole Branch with all those

557
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:21,319
Long Tall stretchy branches that is

558
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,240
stretchy you guys have dealt with

559
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:26,038
stretchy before some of my stuff

560
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,519
unfortunately can be a bit stretchy then

561
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:30,240
the opposite of that is squatty plants

562
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,319
if you guys grow those plantss that they

563
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,798
don't go up a lot nuke town will do this

564
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,480
new town grows outward a lot uh but it

565
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,400
stays low that's a low squatty plant so

566
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,720
it's just down there if you've got a low

567
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,759
grow space I may recommend the nuke town

568
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,279
it may shoot up one appical dominant top

569
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,599
chop that [ __ ] out you got a nice Bush

570
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,079
bushy uh squatty plant there you go

571
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,279
that's and it's that one's kind of a

572
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,359
mess in the middle that's got a uh the

573
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,720
branches are open but on the inside it's

574
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,079
real branchy and leafy on the inside so

575
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,759
those are some structural terms uh some

576
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,918
visual descriptors we could talk about

577
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:05,879
that would identify the structure uh

578
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:08,000
branchy I just said branchy so nuke town

579
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,760
has train wreck in the lineage in the

580
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,798
background somewhere and that train

581
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,798
wreck represents itself in New Town as

582
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:15,839
just massive branches going every

583
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,359
direction uh you get the main branch

584
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,359
going up then you get a lot of [ __ ]

585
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,639
going out but then off of those you also

586
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,038
get little sub branches that most of the

587
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,200
time we would cut off cuz they're just

588
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,599
little suckers and we lollipop that if

589
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,480
you leave those on the nuk town they

590
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,959
will make more Buds and more free

591
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,558
branches so that is a branchy [ __ ]

592
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,840
plant in my opinion uh a word I've used

593
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:38,879
frequently also is bushy uh the red line

594
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:41,038
Red Line will go up and then it'll start

595
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,320
to go out especially if you top red line

596
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,919
take out that main top it'll get bushy

597
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,038
uh it'll look like a shrub or a hedge

598
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,960
you could just put two of them in front

599
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,158
of the front door it'll look like bushes

600
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,960
out there like you're greeting people

601
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,480
with nice bushes in front of the house

602
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,400
so that's bushy you guys understand

603
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,759
bushy the shrubs all the [ __ ] that you

604
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,159
see the decorative [ __ ] out there those

605
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,158
are bushes um tall plants a lot of my

606
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,200
stuff unfortunately I said now tall and

607
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,760
stretchy could be similar and different

608
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,080
at the same time you can have a tall

609
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:08,960
plant with tight node spacing have I

610
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,038
talked about tight node spacing yeah

611
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,400
we're going to talk more about that

612
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:13,919
stuff too I got that going on uh tall

613
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,480
plants and stretchy plants can be

614
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,440
different um Jack Jack Tripper will get

615
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,360
stretchy but uh the John Lemon will get

616
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,159
tall and that's a different thing

617
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,199
because it stays compact it stays

618
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,960
together it all gets tall where Jack

619
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,440
Tripper just [ __ ] that top takes off

620
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,519
the branches get out of control um so

621
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,000
that's tall and stretchy are different

622
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,720
things and then some plants grow very

623
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,359
wide um I used the the red line as an

624
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,798
example that one you might want to give

625
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,479
it a little bit of extra space because

626
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,158
it wants to reach out sometimes the

627
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,960
machine uh Saka sule those like to reach

628
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,520
out just a little bit and take up a

629
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,400
little bit more space if you ever grew

630
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,038
my Prana that was a plant that liked

631
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,600
more wide space more than it did the

632
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,200
vertical space so that is basically the

633
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,959
frame and structure that I'm talking

634
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,640
about when it comes to cannabis now

635
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,079
there are more things to cover on this

636
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,080
list now the next thing on my list is

637
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:04,678
node spacing I touched on this a little

638
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:07,278
bit ago when I was talking about tight

639
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,919
plants what do I mean by node spacing so

640
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:11,038
we've got our main stock of our plant

641
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,559
and we've got branches coming off of

642
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,759
that main stock by node spacing I mean

643
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,960
how far apart are those nodes and also

644
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:20,519
how far apart are those nodes on the

645
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,440
branches so you got your main branch

646
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,759
coming off and you've got more branches

647
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,159
and then you got more branch and more

648
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,079
branches how far apart is that there are

649
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,559
pros and cons to far and close

650
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:32,879
structures like that if your nodes are

651
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,839
too close together then that that plant

652
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,600
may not work in a high humidity

653
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,918
environment that plant may have a lot of

654
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,839
problems because there's going to be

655
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,799
branches close together leaves close

656
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,519
together high humidity may cause you

657
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:45,278
problems so you may want something a

658
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,400
little more open structured a little

659
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:49,519
less tight node spacing may be

660
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,679
appropriate a lot of the OG cush type

661
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,918
stuff has that far apart node spacing

662
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,200
but the Golden Goat has got really nice

663
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,960
kind of tight node spacing so if I breed

664
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,200
that Golden Goat to something kind of OG

665
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,640
G cushy it comes out with a really nice

666
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,480
frame and structure and really nice

667
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,759
appropriate node spacing it's not too

668
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,278
far apart to make the plant stretchy uh

669
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:10,440
and it's not too close together to give

670
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:12,960
it problems so I really think the Golden

671
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,519
Goat to older stuff really makes uh good

672
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,798
structured and shaped plants that's why

673
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,400
I use the Golden Goat so much it fixes

674
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,879
up a lot of that stretchy structure so

675
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,400
that's a lot of what I mean by node

676
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,440
spacing how far apart are the branches

677
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,320
uh from the main stock and also how far

678
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,960
apart are the shoots and Bud s sites on

679
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,000
those branches so that's what I mean by

680
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,558
node spacing another thing to think

681
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,038
about that tells us a lot about the

682
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:39,519
plant is leaf shape and size how big are

683
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,278
those leaves and what shape are they are

684
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,000
they real skinny long leaves are they

685
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,240
big fat leaves that you can make a shade

686
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,839
underneath that leaf structure and size

687
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,440
and shape will tell you a lot about that

688
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,079
cannabis plant it tell you a lot about

689
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,960
how long it's going to take to flower if

690
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:54,439
those leaves are real huge you may have

691
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
like an eight or nine week flowering

692
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,600
plant the longer and skinnier those

693
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,240
leaves get the longer flowering plant

694
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:02,639
you're generally going to have that

695
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,400
usually does apply so that's not a hard

696
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,759
and fast rule of thumb but most of the

697
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,559
time if you look at all your plants in

698
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,400
the room you go well holy [ __ ] that

699
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,000
Golden Goat that Jack trier's got them

700
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,880
long skinny leaves it's the longest

701
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,798
flowering plant in the room if you've

702
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,720
got Isabella those going to be long

703
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,200
skinny gigantic leaves it's going to be

704
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,038
one of the longest flowering plants in

705
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,000
the room uh if you've got some of the

706
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,038
old daybreaker crosses I made those make

707
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,839
giant leaves they finish up quite

708
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:28,000
quickly so you'll notice that leaf shape

709
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,038
will give you a huge indication of how

710
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,640
long that plant is going to need to

711
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:34,798
flower um then I talk about sturdy or

712
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,000
wispy branches that's a huge indicator

713
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,319
that definitely lies into structure uh

714
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,599
sturdy are the plants sturdy or are they

715
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,798
wispy and shitty um you'll notice a lot

716
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,278
of those OG kushes they can be kind of

717
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:46,679
wispy and shitty and need a lot of

718
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:48,240
supports but things that have been bred

719
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,759
with the Golden Goat the Golden Goat

720
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,679
itself a lot of the Jack Jack the Ripper

721
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,319
crosses those are very sturdy the

722
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,080
Platinum Tangi all the Tangi crosses uh

723
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,079
orange gasm it'll just hold itself right

724
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,079
up it's ready to go it will salute so

725
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,119
you got sturdy branching versus wispy

726
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,038
branching uh you got some plants that

727
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,639
make that a real Woody sort of a

728
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,558
structure some are just genetically will

729
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,120
make that Woody structure some will make

730
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,960
a real soft green plush structure uh

731
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,439
those both have their pros and cons so

732
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,399
those do fall into structure when I'm

733
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,759
talking about structure what else do I

734
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:21,798
have nug formation flower cluster um

735
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,679
some plants those OG kushes I've been

736
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:25,440
talking about are going to make golf

737
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,519
ball buds up that stock you're just

738
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,480
going to have a golf ball then 6 in 3 in

739
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,639
up there' be a golf ball and then a golf

740
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,798
ball they'll get bigger as they get to

741
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
the top of the plant and those golf

742
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:35,798
balls hopefully will'll turn into a nice

743
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,479
Cola at the top but those OG cushion are

744
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:39,558
going to make your golf ball type

745
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,079
structure then some of the other stuff

746
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:43,079
I'm just going to use Golden Goat you're

747
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,918
going to get that big donkey dick

748
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,119
baseball bat type of structure then I've

749
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,038
got plants like Grateful Dog that make

750
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,959
Acorn style buds they're silver and

751
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,359
purple they look like big acorns they

752
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,159
just triangles all over the plant you're

753
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,439
going to have different bud structure

754
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:58,240
sometimes you're going to have real

755
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,278
dense real tight buds

756
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,000
sometimes you're going to have open

757
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,440
fingery possibly foxtail type of buds

758
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,919
that's just all about the structure the

759
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,679
phenotype the genetics of that plant

760
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,038
what else do we have colors and Aromas

761
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,840
those are obvious we've talked about

762
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,158
that before colors that's what colors

763
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:15,000
the damn plants are Aromas uh that's

764
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:16,480
what you think it smells like sometimes

765
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,159
I'll tell people this smells like bubble

766
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,120
gum and they'll tell me I'm crazy or

767
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,240
whatever no it's subjective bro to me it

768
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,839
smells like bubble gum uh where are we I

769
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,759
wanted to give a couple of examples like

770
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:30,240
I did earlier um a tall plant let me

771
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,440
Jeffrey would qualify as a tall plant

772
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,319
all of the uh Jack the Ripper crosses

773
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,320
will qualify as tall plants branchy

774
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:40,359
plants uh nuk Town qualifies as a very

775
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,359
branchy plant the Double Dragon as a

776
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:44,000
branchy plant the bubble goat some of

777
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,398
those bubble goat phenotypes have that

778
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
open structure that I've talked about

779
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:48,519
and that's a real classic uh Christmas

780
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,880
tree looking sort of a shape real easy

781
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,278
to grow sort of a plant uh the orange

782
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,200
gasm that is a tall plant with a tight

783
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,480
structure so those are some examples of

784
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,319
some of my plants and the structures

785
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,079
that that I would identify so those are

786
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:02,480
just a few examples from strains in my

787
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,879
lineup that I can tell you about the

788
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,120
structure of course you're going to get

789
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,520
phenotypical variation uh different

790
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,918
lighting is going to give you different

791
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,720
amounts of stretch and different amounts

792
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,278
of height the way you feed uh your

793
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,278
environment will play into this but this

794
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:16,519
is generally what you can expect and

795
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,839
this guideline is just basically what I

796
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,158
call uh the basic structures of plants

797
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,599
that open structure that tight structure

798
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:23,960
uh you got some plants you can see it if

799
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,839
you drive through Cali you'll be able to

800
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,200
tell these differences uh out there in

801
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,839
the fields real easily there's those

802
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,159
super tall tall sativa plants uh they're

803
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,158
going to be out there for a long time

804
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:34,399
those are what I call the tall

805
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,120
stretchier plants those tight plants

806
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,798
that look like a big shrub and a bush

807
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:40,599
those are tight bushy plants uh once you

808
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,038
