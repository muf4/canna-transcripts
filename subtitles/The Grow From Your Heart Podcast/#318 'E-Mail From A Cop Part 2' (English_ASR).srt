i'm dad and on today I've been taking

00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,609
dabs of New York City diesel and Broza

23
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,829
batter from our friends at apothecary

24
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:50,480
extracts I just cracked open the jar and

25
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:52,189
I'm holding it kind of kind of low it's

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,369
on the table it's not up by my face and

27
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:57,049
I can just smell the diesel funk chirps

28
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:59,088
coming out of this it is overwhelming

29
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:02,088
when you take a dab of this it leaves

30
00:00:59,088 --> 00:01:03,350
this diesel e layer of funky cottonmouth

31
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:05,688
over your tongue that is just

32
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,790
disgustingly delightful I love it it is

33
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:09,889
so thick and so funky it's got my mouth

34
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,409
super dry but I love it it's a good

35
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,390
thing the high is intense it comes on

36
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:16,520
super quickly it goes right to the face

37
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,959
right to the head and something that

38
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:20,450
I've noticed from smoking it all day

39
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,849
usually my eyes don't get very red when

40
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,790
I smoke but today my eyes are bloody

41
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:27,438
dragon red from the New York City Diesel

42
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,299

51
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,680

52
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:52,759
of the videos up on YouTube that's right

53
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,170
all 317 episodes are now up on YouTube

54
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,239
which means I'm one behind because this

55
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,219
episode is out but I'm going to try to

56
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,839
get everything out within a week of

57
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,728
posting a new episode so when the

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,649
episodes come out on iTunes and stitcher

59
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:05,840
within a week I'll try to have it up on

60
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:07,009
YouTube which shouldn't be a challenge

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,899
at all I'm just saying a week to buy

62
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:10,459
myself time it takes me a little bit of

63
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,930
time to make the video and then loading

64
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,550
the video take several hours and then

65
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,879
YouTube has to process the video and

66
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,860
then it

67
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,870
finally pops up so I'm gonna try to stay

68
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,280
less than a week behind on all of the

69
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,230
YouTube videos that means the people

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,699
watching on YouTube are almost current

71
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,709
they're less than a week behind at all

72
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:26,209
times so all of the videos are on

73
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,469
YouTube if you want to watch on YouTube

74
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,870
just simply search for the girl from

75
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,389
your heart podcast and you will find the

76
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,640
channel on the last episode of the

77
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:36,199
podcast I read an email from a cop

78
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,149
and while I was reading his email I

79
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,699
actually asked him a few questions and

80
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,200
he was kind enough to reply already so

81
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:44,299
I've got a response from our friend of

82
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,339
the cop I mean if you didn't listen make

83
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,960
sure you go back and listen to episode

84
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,180
317 where I read the email from a cop

85
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,969
and this is email from a cop

86
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,469
part two and it goes like this hey Rasta

87
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:56,449
Jeff I hope this message finds you well

88
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:58,099
I listen to the podcast and I was really

89
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:59,539
stoked to hear my letter I wanted to

90
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,329
address a few points we brought up

91
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:04,159
during the program you gave a small rent

92
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,900
on how cops giving tickets and arresting

93
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,030
people has a snowball like effect on

94
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,370
people and becomes more punitive than a

95
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,830
simple ticket and I totally agree I

96
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,469
personally can't stand Highway Patrol or

97
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,150
traffic enforcement I got into this to

98
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:19,580
help people who can't help themselves

99
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,740
and to go after the Predators in society

100
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,390
I feel like people deserve warnings a

101
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,460
chance to be educated about traffic

102
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:28,309
violations and to be wish'd well on

103
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,530
their way save the ink for the real bad

104
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,909
dude hey I like that approach sometimes

105
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,110
you got to pull people over and say hey

106
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,490
bro we need you to slow down in this

107
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,350
area because we got trucks coming on the

108
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,780
highway or whatever but just pull them

109
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,099
over explain why don't pull them over

110
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,689
give him a hundred and fifty dollar

111
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,939
ticket and [ __ ] up their whole month and

112
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,469
then they hate the cops so I like your

113
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:46,909
approach man pull him over explain why

114
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:48,949
don't give them a ticket tell them hey

115
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:50,990
be careful have a great day send them on

116
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:52,339
their way that's how I think policing

117
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,409
should be done that is proper that's

118
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,659
respectable that's respectful that's

119
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:58,400
what we want so the email goes on and it

120
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,379
says I also wanted to address your

121
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,030
question about if I will be able to be a

122
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,319
cannabis advocate with my law

123
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,900
enforcement coworkers

124
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,939
the answer is yes and no by my actions

125
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,950
and my attitude I can influence other

126
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:12,079
officers but I will not be able to be

127
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,329
open about the amazing effects cannabis

128
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,670
has had for me while I am still employed

129
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,530
by the department so that makes sense

130
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,989
you can't go talking about something

131
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,849
that could get you fired and will cause

132
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,619
turmoil within within your job so that

133
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,120
makes sense as long as your co-workers

134
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,530
are seeing it and they're like man he's

135
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,540
he's actually doing pretty well just

136
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,159
using cannabis and you're not my two

137
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,080
braggadocious about it and too open

138
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,070
about it I bet your close friends see it

139
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,209
and I bet they're telling their other

140
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:37,099
friends and I bet words getting around

141
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,299
and they know without you blasting it

142
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,919
too much without airing it out they're

143
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,790
too much so that's cool I hope I hope

144
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:41,990
they're learning I hope they're

145
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,080
accepting you I hope nobody's uh

146
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,699
targeting you there's one more paragraph

147
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,829
of the email and it goes like this by

148
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,019
the way is any string with black cherry

149
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:52,909
in it meant it was originally from you

150
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:54,769
I'm really enjoying some black cherry

151
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,630
cookies indica right now and it's super

152
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,490
yummy what he's referring to is my

153
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,139
strained black cherry Kim I made a cross

154
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,300
called black cherry Kim several years

155
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,329
ago which is discontinued it's no longer

156
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,129
available but no if it says black cherry

157
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:08,750
Kim that does not mean I made it I got

158
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:11,000
the black cherry clone I didn't even use

159
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,279
black cherry black cherry Kim was at

160
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,230
plush berry cross the plush berry was

161
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,849
very black cherry dominant and it made

162
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,220
it brought out the black cherry in the

163
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,560
black cherry Kim so it got the name

164
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,630
black cherry Kim I did not make the

165
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,120
black cherry soda that was from another

166
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:28,219
breeder who I believe may be from Oregon

167
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,110
but I'm not sure that is kind of an

168
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,000
older strain and no I did not breed or

169
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,319
create the black cherry not everything

170
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,418
with black cherry and it was gonna be

171
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,529
from me so don't give me credit for all

172
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,060
that black cherry stuff you guys that

173
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:40,159
was not all me the black cherry Kim is

want their name said or not uh yes get

231
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,759
roasted and toasted for 20 as this

232
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,079
person's name they said I just started

233
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,550
listening to your podcast I've been

234
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,829
growing for about a year now I would

235
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,650
like to know what you think about back

236
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:42,180
building or Bud pinching technique the

237
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:44,489
email goes on to say Plus do you have a

238
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,199
strain that's 20 to 1 CBD I'm needing a

239
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,960
strain for my wife who has lupus and

240
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,939
cannot have high levels of THC dude due

241
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,949
to being a patient of a pain clinic in

242
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,500
my state that has not gotten there as

243
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:58,439
far as legalization thank you get

244
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,439
roasted and toasted for 20 let's start

245
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,509
from the top here get roasted um back

246
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,980
building and bud pinching I had to

247
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,199
google that and figure out what that was

248
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,740
I had to ask this email or what they

249
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,079
meant by that

250
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,180
they said that back building is where

251
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,668
you cut off the top of a bud to induce

252
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,829
bud growth something like one tenth of

253
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:18,269
the bud size I'm and he told me to

254
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,870
google it and he said he just saw it

255
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:23,819
come up in forms and on Google I think I

256
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,620
did this a long time ago to a plant on

257
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,629
accident I was moving a plant that had

258
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,699
just started budding and the top of it

259
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,860
got chopped off and it made a pretty

260
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,929
good size top bud but it never tightened

261
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,599
up the bottom of the plant made nice

262
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:38,699
buds but that top one just grew funky I

263
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,599
honestly don't have any experience in

264
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,990
that I don't think I would encourage

265
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,400
cutting off buds during flowering I

266
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,440
could be totally wrong but in my opinion

267
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,179
I feel like this would probably slow

268
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,580
down your plants it may make them

269
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,319
explode it may be very strange specific

270
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,759
but it's not

271
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,800
thing that I would recommend for a

272
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,569
commercial setting I think it would be

273
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,829
time-consuming and unless it's going to

274
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,840
give me a whole bunch of more but I

275
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,990
don't think it would be worth it so no I

276
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,000
don't have any experience with back

277
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,039
building or bud pinching I don't know

278
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,480
enough about it to say that I would

279
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,279
recommend it honestly it sounds like

280
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,560
something that I would probably skip

281
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,819
personally maybe experiment it with it

282
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,919
in your personal garden if you want to

283
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,810
try it maybe pick one plant and back

284
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,250
build it bud pinch it and then don't do

285
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,629
that to the other plants and see if that

286
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,080
one performs better

287
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:28,820
maybe it's strains specific but from my

288
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,770
experience when I accidentally did that

289
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,300
I did not like the outcome if you're

290
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,009
trying to grow things that you just want

291
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,599
to make concentrates maybe that would

292
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,519
work for you because in my experience it

293
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,440
made a fluffier but it didn't tighten up

294
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,909
like it should have the rest of the buds

295
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,740
tightened up the rest of the plants of

296
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:45,139
the same strain got tighter or more

297
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,850
dense is what I mean and that top bud

298
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:48,710
where I kind of pinched it on accident

299
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,840
that one didn't tighten up like the rest

300
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,530
so that's my experience and I wouldn't

301
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,330
do it again

302
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,490
so for the next part of your email you

303
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,639
asked if I have a strain that is 20 to 1

304
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,259
CBD to THC no unfortunately I do not

305
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,240
breathe that direction most of what I

306
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:04,730
breed is the exact opposite I am

307
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,879
breeding for high THC I am NOT a fan of

308
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,800
CBD I apologize that is just not what I

309
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,529
am breeding for I usually breed strains

310
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,269
that work for my brain injury strains

311
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,220
that work for my body's hype strains

312
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,370
that work for me I'm my guinea pig I'm

313
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,440
my tester so I'm breeding high THC high

314
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,539
limonene high Turpin alene type strains

315
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,450
that's the stuff I'm going for I do

316
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:28,939
apologize I don't have the 20 to 1 CBD

317
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,290
strain that you're looking for I do want

318
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,790
you to find something that will help out

319
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:33,889
your wife with her lupus that sounds

320
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:36,169
terrible I would recommend Tora Bora

321
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:38,629
from DNA genetics if you can find Tora

322
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:41,000
Bora that's a high CBD strain it is

323
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:43,820
reliable it's been lab tested and it's a

324
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,529
proven cannabis cup winter so look for

325
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,360
the Tora Bora from DNA genetics and

326
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:49,429
