the igro culture podcast I had a great

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,359
long discussion with Mike and Jesse it

49
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,399
starts off with just some random chatter

50
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,959
I decided to hit record uh I thought I'd

51
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,399
leave that in the show so without

52
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,839
further ado

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,560
here comes the podcast so quite a while

54
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,118
ago uh man how many years ago was it

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,479
when we had Metar going Mike five all

56
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:13,159
right four five six somewhere there I

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,480
don't know pot pot so pot years ago

58
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,680
between five and eight years ago Dude it

59
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,399
was close to seven or eight years ago

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
possibly by now I don't remember what

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,599
year it

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,800
was okay 08 098 08 it was 08 so it's

63
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:26,919
been six years all right so about six

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,239
years ago Mike and I were employed at a

65
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:32,518
dispensary together uh I was mostly the

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,680
dude in charge I managed I Bud tended I

67
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,959
cleaned I I thought I applied for the

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,200
job with you and then like I was told

69
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,920
you weren't the manager and then you

70
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,518
were the I don't know that place had

71
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,679
structure issues right yeah yeah that's

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,400
definitely uh I was hired well I was I

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
was hired as the guy there to help

74
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,719
transplant you kept the place from like

75
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,199
wandering away like the customers from

76
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,878
like carrying the furniture off and the

77
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,598
employees showing up on time and not

78
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:00,439
stealing everything there were there

79
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:02,158
were a lot of Chiefs in no India and

80
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,598
then one day I talked to the boss and I

81
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,079
was like I was straight up with the boss

82
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,399
I was like dude you are a great pot

83
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,400
grower you're a good man you've got a

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,480
good business but honestly you have no

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,640
idea how to run a damn business and he

86
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,079
kind of laughed at me the way that he

87
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,000
did he's a southern guy and he's real

88
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,879
laid-back so he just chuckled at me you

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,318
might be right about that and he handed

90
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,639
me the keys to the shop and he said here

91
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,439
you have a dispensary and see what it's

92
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,919
like and

93
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,840
so man I miss the good old days don't

94
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,079
you so from that day I pretty much had a

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,319
dispensary and we we rocked that place

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,519
we did uh I had days over $10,000 in

97
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,479
sales in one day I think of it as the

98
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,000
time I had the best job ever that was

99
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,878
the Wild Wild West it was wonderful it

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,639
was it was crazy it was definitely the

101
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:46,359
wild west kids coming in with quarter

102
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,798
pounds and backpacks and um boss handing

103
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,400
you three Edibles at the beginning of

104
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:50,920
your shift and asking how they tasted

105
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,519
four minutes later like yeah dude those

106
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,559
are two we got to elaborate on both of

107
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,719
those topics right we would have people

108
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,318
was people we would be at work just

109
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,479
serving customers cleaning up I would

110
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,078
have ree playing I'd have my laptop on

111
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,919
the desk playing music people would come

112
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,920
in uh I'd have a we'd be smoking a joint

113
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,158
I had a vaporizer set up at the bud bar

114
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,280
so that well to be fair we usually smoke

115
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:13,078
joints upstairs away from the customer

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,039
service area but there was plenty of

117
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,720
that downstairs too in the beginning I

118
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,358
was reckless in just smoking joints

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,079
because it was there were no rules there

120
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,399
were no rules as long as everybody had a

121
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,840
medical marijuana card we could be

122
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,000
smoking medical marijuana so there

123
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,159
weren't any things to worry about right

124
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,720
so we're all in there smoking and

125
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,240
customers are coming people would show

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,479
up and be like hey do you want to check

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,918
out this Sour Diesel that I grew I'd be

128
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,240
like I sure do and then they'd offer it

129
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,079
to you I'll give it to you for this much

130
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,879
a quarter pound and I'd be like well you

131
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,839
see what we sell at 4 and8 so you got to

132
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,279
give me a deal on that and then we'd get

133
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,478
a good price together and we'd start

134
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,799
selling that person's quarter pounds yep

135
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,240
so the good old days the good old days

136
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,919
Mike would be able to grow a quarter

137
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,680
pound and bring it in work and put it on

138
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,519
the shelf and get paid for it every

139
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,160
employee had something on this shelf

140
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,879
that they had arranged and had a little

141
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,400
profit cut of I remember that I remember

142
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,879
mine was little infused candies yeah I

143
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,319
of course had herb on the shelf that I

144
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,478
was growing a lot of White Rhino and

145
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,038
Cherry Widow was coming from my Gardens

146
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:09,758
you'd be able to so I would take my

147
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,879
quarter pound that I grew in my basement

148
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,960
and take that to work sell it to the

149
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,399
boss essentially for a specified price

150
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,120
and then get an hourly rate to stand

151
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,478
there and sell it yeah to push my

152
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,840
product that I just grew so that it'll

153
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:22,240
sell out sooner so that I could bring

154
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,839
another quarter pound back to work

155
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,000

156
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,879

157
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,120
end of the day and be like great job we

but I had one day off a week and I would

166
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:48,318
spend that one day uh I would drive to

167
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,080
another city and not be the dispensary

168
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,840
employee I would go in as a customer to

169
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,680
as many shops as I could and just go do

170
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,000
Recon work at all these dispensaries and

171
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
see what they had to offer and see how

172
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,038
their shops are set up see what who's

173
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
working there see what the bud tenders

174
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,959
know because I wanted I'm always that

175
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,160
guy if I'm doing something I want to be

176
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,680
really good at it I want to be the best

177
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,960
uh so I always go well let's see what

178
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,639
the best looks like you know let's go

179
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,198
try to see what I want to do and also

180
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,840
learn what I do not want to do cuz I saw

181
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,000
so we saw a lot of ways to do it wrong

182
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:20,119
yeah there was so much [ __ ] available uh

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,478
there are some shops that you can

184
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,478
smell uh that musty hay improperly cured

185
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,879
and dried cannabis smell in the waiting

186
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,758
room right and you're like I I just want

187
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,000
to leave I can already tell that this is

188
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,439
going to be b-grade product right I got

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,259
my feet wet uh growing commercial

190
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,598
cannabis in one of those

191
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,560
[Music]

192
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:45,120
places so how uh how challenging is it

193
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,639
to go from being an outdoor grower to

194
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,680
being like uh you're I want to call you

195
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,280
a caregiver you're an indoor they call

196
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,160
us basement Growers is what we're

197
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,879
labeled as but you know that's a

198
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,759
derogatory term it kind of is but uh if

199
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,598
you've got the right basement then yeah

200
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,160
it's not that you can't be a really

201
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,598
awesome sexy basement grower it's that

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,400
it's still sort of a dig yeah yeah I

203
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,159
like caregiver private caregiver

204
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,159
something along those lines how how was

205
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,319
your how were your changes going from

206
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,550
being a caregiver and a residential grow

207
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,639
to having a gigantic commercial

208
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,960
[Music]

209
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,680
grow um I always say it's uh you're on a

210
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,598
commercial grow you're not growing weed

211
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,120
you're managing a a

212
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:30,279
schedule um it's uh more of a a plant

213
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,840
management no fund intended but you know

214
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,839
you're trying to keep all the wheels

215
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:38,000
greased and rolling and functioning

216
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:40,719
properly um and if you start into a grow

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that didn't have that uh mindset to

218
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,319
begin with it's quite disastrous oh so

219
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,439
you had to come in and kind of take over

220
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,960
for somebody else I had to learn that

221
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,560
from I you know I I have no College

222
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,878
ucation learn the hard way in the middle

223
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,800
of it huh yeah yeah exactly trial by

224
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,280
fire yeah yeah sink or swim and also I

225
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,879
got to give you credit because the shop

226
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,000
that you were thrown into to uh they did

227
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,120
not provide the proper equipment

228
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,800
supplies no actually there was one

229
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,598
before that but oh okay yeah but uh yeah

230
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,199
no that one was a joke

231
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,560
too did you learn a lot from having to

232
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,560
deal with the joke at least yes oh

233
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,199
tremendous learning what not to do is

234
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,800
just as beneficial as Lear as learning

235
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,478
what learning what to do yeah um

236
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,680
sometimes it helps to figure out why you

237
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,639
do it that way by seeing how what

238
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,079
happens when it's done wrong yeah some

239
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,158
people can only learn that way I've

240
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,000
worked for a few of those people I made

241
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:33,879
just have to stand back and let it crash

242
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,080
I made a completely amateur mistake the

243
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,958
other night uh I've got a gorilla glue

244
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,599
plant and it's growing out of control so

245
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,879
I'm sort of it's kind of mainlining but

246
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,959
not really cuz I'm not cleaning

247
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,679
everything off I'm just trying to pull

248
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,399
it down I split that [ __ ] right down

249
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,559
the middle trying to pull one side too

250
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,278
far from the other it just uh one piece

251
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,399
of duct tape and a twisty tie it was all

252
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,000
happy yep but maybe a little clone gel

253
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,360
you know I thought about it but I I just

254
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,839
thought I panicked and was like I just

255
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,519
wrap this up now get out of here and

256
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,279
just quick first stayed splint it and go

257
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,759
yeah she's cool she's happy four or five

258
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,159
days later she's happier she looks

259
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,838
stronger there than she did before so

260
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,120
yeah they're Hardy made a super no

261
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,440
mistake so going all you had something

262
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,799
go for it oh I was just going to say

263
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,800
there's a reason they called it weed

264
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,479
yeah I mean it grows like a damn weed if

265
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,479
you do it right going to all those

266
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,360
dispensaries through I've been to shops

267
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,200
from uh PUO Colorado Springs

268
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,720
Denver uh east and west of Denver both

269
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,839
directions I haven't gotten up to

270
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,759
Boulder at Fort Collins to the

271
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,000
dispensaries but it seems like oh I have

272
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,159
but you're no shops in Fort Collins I

273
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,278
was up at a couple in Fort Collins

274
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:42,399
before they got killed um a long time

275
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,838
back in the batt old days again but uh

276
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,839
they were about like you'd see

277
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,720
everywhere um there are good and bad

278
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,959
examples and the good examples range the

279
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,000
Spectrum from very cultur to very

280
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,039
medical officy and so do the bad ones

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
but I don't know there's a lot of both

282
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:01,319
do you think that the huge regulation

283
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,320
has changed the quality and product

284
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:09,278
yes and no I think it hurt and helped it

285
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,039
okay um a lot of the incredible Growers

286
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,278
couldn't handle the regulation when it

287
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,679
first came down and then quality dropped

288
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,278
and it stayed kind of

289
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,799
down I don't want to you know bash it

290
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,639
too bad but quality dipped for a while

291
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,278
when the best Growers were all forced

292
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,120
out of the legal industry and it took a

293
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,639
while for the people who were great at

294
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,720
business and great at foll in

295
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,319
regulations to catch up with making a

296
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,959
great product well and then also oh

297
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,720
sorry no it's cool well there were

298
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:41,559
industry leaders for a while and I think

299
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,160
now solid product is more common than

300
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:46,039
Shady product but then again I'm not up

301
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,919
at the shops as often as I'd like to be

302
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,599
to say this [ __ ] with more confidence

303
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,679
right one of the things that kind of

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,399
annoys me we made all these regulations

305
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,319
to prevent shitty weed pesticides mil

306
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,919
problems guess what we're still getting

307
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,800
it they haven't they don't go inspect

308
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,759
the but at all they just pay attention

309
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,199
to the dollars and the sales they don't

310
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,399
care about the products or the safety

311
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,920
they check on the Edibles and make sure

312
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,600
the Edibles are the proper dosage but

313
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,159
other than that they don't really care

314
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,360
there isn't a regulatory system for

315
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:18,240
safety inspections for smokables other

316
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,360
than through tobacco and Colorado didn't

317
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,480
really have that

318
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,399
infrastructure with the food stuff

319
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,360
kitchen safety and all of those rules

320
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,958
are already in place and we saw what

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,839
happened when those first inspections

322
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,838
came out uh yeah everybody table kind of

323
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,680
smiled and looked at the sorry AJ I was

324
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,959
going to say theyve just recently

325
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,879
started enforcing these we saw AJ at the

326
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,599
secret cup over the weekend and uh it's

327

listen to the show AJ hashman shout out

331
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,639
over a 100 people got dinged and it's

332
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,639
not like they were doing

333
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,519
anything that bad or that wrong it was

334
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,399
just their first taste of what the

335
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,600
high-end food quality regulations really

336
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,839
looked like and in a medical edible

337
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,120
production kitchen like even Dixie got

338
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,170
hit and they're the ones that are like

339
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
the shining example in the

340
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:10,759
[Music]

341
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,879
industry it's just as the regulations

342
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,799
come down the people that were great at

343
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,679
following them have to step up and

344
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,120
figure out how to be great at growing

345
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,078
weed too cuz they haven't been

346
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,320
practicing for 20 years because they

347
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:24,439
were terrified of breaking the rules

348
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,720
that's why they're good at following

349
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,720
them

350
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,839
now that's why you can't my product on

351
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,000
the Shelf because they changed all those

352
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,360
rules yeah I think when it was all the

353
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,839
basement Growers and the caregivers

354
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,560
doing it in the basement it got to a

355
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,199
shop yeah it did because well all the

356
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,679
cameras all the regulations all that

357
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:45,759
stuff is super expensive but the the big

358
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,799
expense to start off is the property

359
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,879
like unless you can find a landlord

360
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:53,000
willing to give Uncle Sam his property

361
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:55,720
to let you live your dream which thanks

362
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Dad other than that you ain't finding it

363
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,480
um so you got to buy the property

364
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,159
yourself and unless you've got a million

365
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,959
dollars you're not owning retail

366
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,759
property in Colorado sir yeah not

367
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,198
anywhere other people live anyway yeah

368
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,958
yeah well I know several people that are

369
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:12,240
on the look for property there's always

370
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:15,559
that hunt raise his hand um from a

371
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,519
grower standpoint to um most business or

372
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,559
most dispensary owners are more at this

373
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,440
day and age they're more of a

374
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:25,278
business-minded person um and like you

375
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,000
said know nothing about growing and they

376
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,320
can be incredibly hard to work with from

377
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,759
a Grower's point of view you know I wish

378
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,199
I would have learned I wish I would have

379
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,360
gone to business school instead of

380
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:36,159
learning to be a super good pot grower I

381
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,600
went to business school these

382
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,399
regulations are confusing as [ __ ] oh

383
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,600
yeah like it ain't the lack of

384
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,078
schooling like you're better at business

385
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,720
than most of the people that I went to

386
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,439
Du business school with and you dropped

387
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,800
out of society and went on tour while

388
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
they went to college like it doesn't

389
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,559
have a lot to do with how well you did

390
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,680
in business school yeah I think the life

391
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,119
experience was

392
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,719
priceless uh right now following the

393
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,839
regulations is really a question of are

394
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,160
you willing to pay your

395
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,639
lawyer you got to have that Capital to

396
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,120
have that lawyer cuz the weed lawyers

397
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,198
are ridiculous right

398
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,320
now I don't know it's from my perception

399
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:15,159
kind of from the outside because I

400
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,519
really don't do a lot of shop shopping

401
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:20,799
or not as much as I'd like but the

402
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,720
really successful shops that have uh a

403
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,919
handful of locations a reputation for

404
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,759
amazing consistent product are the ones

405
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:32,360
that really invested in

406
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,199
a good grower and setting up a grow that

407
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,360
that grower can really run and paid the

408
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:42,078
[ __ ] out of their lawyer and their

409
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,320
grower and their grower they Happ oh so

410
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,599
many shops died because the grower in

411
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,720
the business people got in a pissing

412
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,920
contest and rather than succeed they

413
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,560
just peed on each other a bunch one of

414
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,000
the most popular dispensaries in the

415
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,838
state does not have their super popular

416
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,600
grower and grow team anymore because of

417
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,759
recent political changes they chose to

418
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,440
make

419
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,720
yeah I won't call out any names but yeah

420
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,759
that was a terrible breakup I was kind

421
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,199
of sad to see that but it did make for

422
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,519
some great new

423
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,399
opportunities right onward and upward

424
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,759

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,480
on politics um I don't pay attention to

444
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,599
the local news to tell you the truth I

445
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,000
just pay attention to the world and

446
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,000
national Cannabis News and the state

447
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,679
news so luckily Mike brought this to my

448
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,240
attention and Jesse had some stuff to

449
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,439
add to it I put these guys in touch and

450
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,159
then they were like we got to get on the

451
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,959
podcast tonight so it was their idea to

452
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,240
do a show about this so big shout out to

453
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:13,399
these guys thank you guys for giving me

454
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,959
material for sure thank you Mike yeah I

455
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,318
um I don't know what should I just start

456
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,078
telling the story uh I kind of took some

457
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:21,599
notes and I've got a little opening an

458
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,879
opening statement if you will it says St

459
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
let me try that again without a frog in

460
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,919
my throat it says City staff is

461
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,599
attempting to draft a new ordinance that

462
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,599
would ban all indoor growing in the city

463
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,278
of weblo they want to make the rules

464
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,839
that say they want to make rules that

465
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:35,720
say we have to grow in a separate

466
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,360
building detached from our house and

467
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,240
that is [ __ ] because of many reasons

468
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,039
is that pretty uh accurate what I wrote

469
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:48,360
there yeah cool not just uh indoor H

470
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,759
growing though all hom growing so green

471
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,120
no Greenhouse in your backyard no just

472
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,199
out in your

473
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,879
backyard no in your basement no in your

474
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,479
bedroom no little grow cabinet um with

475
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,160
which means everything at your local

476
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,240
hydro store is pretty much uh pointless

477
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,919
cuz you can't use any of it unless you

478
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,240
build a special out building just for

479
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,240
your six personal cannabis plants which

480
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,199
is ridiculous how many of us can afford

481
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,279
to build a special outbuilding just for

482
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,199
our cannabis plants I have six of them

483
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,759
the Hot Topic in the the chieftain the

484
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,199
last couple of weeks has been revolving

485
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,919
around most people in this well not most

486
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,720
people in the city several people in the

487
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,720
City not being able to afford trash

488
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,319
service electricity payments things like

489
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,839
this and we're talking about having

490
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:42,839
people build a special airtight

491
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:45,000
smellproof building so they can grow six

492
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,480
pot plants well technically three

493
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,079
because you're only allowed three In

494
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,038
Bloom at one time so you'd only have

495
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,319
three stinky flowering plants in that

496
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:56,640
building ever at once this would also

497
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:57,918
affect caregivers he's using a 64 as

498
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
reference but it would also affect

499
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,679
caregivers thank you you so they would

500
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,639
just be uh it would affect everybody in

501
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,880
the city outside so you can't do it

502
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,720
isn't that going to make it easier to

503
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,039
steal harder to take care of it's going

504
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,558
to be another building you're going to

505
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:13,359
have to get a building permit you're

506
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:15,440
going to need to wire that building well

507
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,798
dep well everybody in the neighborhood

508
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,919
would know that that's why you know six

509
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:20,359
people on the block or in the

510
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,400
neighborhood or whatever just built that

511
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:25,119
special new building behind their house

512
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,600
you'd have to own your said property yep

513
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,479
it's uh the first place my mind went is

514
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,519
it's a huge kick to Black back Hills

515
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,240
because everybody who's been using a

516
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,158
greenhouse or following the very letter

517
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,519
of the law and just chain linking their

518
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,360
plants into a cage and essentially

519
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,918
growing them purely outdoors in their

520
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:46,240
backyard but in an enclosed lock space

521
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,919
now you've got to put them under

522
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,440
expensive grow lights with fancy you

523
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,320
know air filtration equipment and all of

524
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,200
that's just a huge give to Black Hills

525
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,918
now you said that you had an idea of why

526
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,120
this ordinance was being drafted

527
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,840
so a couple weeks ago and I'm the city

528
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:08,639
council policy nerd I go attend just

529
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:10,639
about every meeting um I was there uh

530
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,360
two weeks ago listening to the

531
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,200
interviews for the new City Council seat

532
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:18,558
and then for the budgetary meeting they

533
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,319
had after that and during the budgetary

534
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,399
meeting just sort of offhandedly a

535
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,519
couple of the council members referenced

536
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,759
a complaint they had all received the

537
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,480
previous week from a homeowner on the

538
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,440
South Side who who's an elderly

539
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,679
gentleman and wakes up every day to the

540
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,200
stink of marijuana plants and now

541
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,720
everybody sitting at this table is like

542
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,558
you ask why' you say stink well it's cuz

543
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,880
that's how this old guy sees it that's

544
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,240
how what he called city council about

545
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,480
and being city council and not having a

546
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,558
whole lot um to do other than please

547
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,279
your constituents and you know respond

548
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,240
to stuff like this a number of them

549
00:19:53,279 --> 00:20:01,839
drove out to this guy's house and gave

550
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:04,000
it a smell and um Sandy daff said it was

551
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,759
a very strong from the driveway she

552
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,480
pulled up into this gentleman's house so

553
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,839
next she pulls up next door and she can

554
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,079
smell this guy's Garden um Steve nocki

555
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,678
said that he didn't really smell it but

556
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,319
when he was standing in the backyard he

557
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,919
could clearly see several plants over

558
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,319
the top of a privacy fence so you know

559
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,880
it gives you an idea how big this

560
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,678
caregiver was doing in his backyard and

561
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880
it doesn't sound like he's meeting all

562
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,038
of the basic city code stuff cuz they

563
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,400
weren't enclosed or locked were just in

564
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,279
his backyard but uh the cops have been

565
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,640
out at this guy's house his neighbors

566
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:39,440
are pissed like would any of you ever

567
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,600
stink out your neighbors like

568
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,640
this like it's it's a pretty easy way to

569
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,038
bring problems on yourself like if I

570
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,919
would be embarrassed if my neighbors

571
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,519
smelled me every morning as an indoor

572
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,080
grower I try to be really covert my

573
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,319
neighbors I'm certain my neighbors know

574
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:54,599
what I do because they've seen me

575
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,720
carrying things they see my dreadlocks

576
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,240
they know who I am uh they've seen my

577
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,360
Facebook they probably listen to the

578
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,880
podcast

579
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,678
one of my neighbors one of my neighbors

580
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,960
was a vendor I don't know what he sold

581
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:08,320
exactly but he brought me a large box of

582
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,840
Lighters fresh lighters like just he's

583
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,879
like I'm pretty sure you guys smoke you

584
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,798
want some lighters and that big gigantic

585
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,679
box over there is that's all lighters

586
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,679
dude I'm serious so my neighbors know

587
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,759
what's up but I still I don't I try to

588
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,559
keep it on the they're not calling City

589
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,599
Council on you saying you're a bad

590
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,278
neighbor because they don't wake up like

591
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,918
I would be mortified like clearly my

592
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:31,640
mother did not raise whoever's growing

593
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,759
these pot plants but um you know so city

594
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,278
council went out there and during the

595
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,240
meeting the other night they mentioned

596
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:38,400
sort of offhandedly that they had all

597
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,278
received this complaint and they all

598
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,240
agreed that this guy should be able to

599
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:44,919
wake up in the morning and not smell his

600
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,359
neighbor's pot plants and they didn't

601
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:48,840
really say anything else about it they

602
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,558
kind of chuckled about the smell and

603
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,158
contact high got thrown around a little

604
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,720
bit and then they went on to they were

605
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,120
busy they were going over budgetary

606
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,880
stuff in the city's millions of dollars

607
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,079
in the hole so it got dropped pretty

608
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,240
quick

609
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,759
and um you know being who I am and doing

610
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,679
what I do all day when I read the

611
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:10,960
article in the chieftain today I called

612
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,159
every city council member in PUO and

613
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,360
three of them called me back today and

614
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,200
discussed this issue and all of them

615
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,879
said that this isn't something that they

616
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,880
asked for or that they're aware that any

617
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,919
other council person asked for rather

618
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,559
it's something the city staff has put

619
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,520
together based on those off-handed com

620
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,399
comments at the council meeting the

621
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,400
other night so this is all the

622
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,038
brainchild of somebody in Planning and

623
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,000
Zoning who's attempting to please his

624
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:43,480
bosses who might not or who he decided

625
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,798
might want to weed can't smell weed in

626
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,919
peblo type ordinance um the city council

627
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,480
people I talked to all use the word

628
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,919
unenforceable or all agreed that any

629
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,240
sort of ordinance that covered growing

630
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,960
pot in a basement or in a garage like

631
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,919
all of that is unenforceable they can't

632
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,558
send some to every house in Pueblo and

633
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,520
check so essentially if you're not being

634
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,038
a jerk and stinking up your neighbor to

635
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,839
begin with there'd be no way for them to

636
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,400
find you making this totally pointless

637
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:14,158
so I don't see it really going anywhere

638
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,720
but regardless um everybody who gives

639
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,559
the [ __ ] needs to show up on the 13th at

640
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,600
700 p.m. at the city council building

641
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,759
down on Union and Grand you're the city

642
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,199
council guy you should be telling me

643
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:28,158
don't look at me with a question mark I

644
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,278
drive I drive there without thinking at

645
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,480
this point yeah I'm pretty sure it's you

646
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:33,759
need I will tweet the correct address

647
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,960
what Mike is saying guys we want to go

648
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,038
on October 13th to city council and tell

649
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,640
them that this proposed idea is

650
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:41,759
unacceptable and that it will not work

651
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,640
for us right while you were talking I

652
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,359
came up with an alternative a cannabis

653
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,080
courtesy law it's like a don't ask don't

654
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:51,278
tell but if we can smell it you got to

655
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:54,278
turn it down that's a cannabis

656
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,839
courtesy good I'd like to see more of a

657
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:58,640
a public service announcement that's

658
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,038
like don't be a [ __ ] [ __ ] sorry

659
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,240
that you can say you can say that I'm

660
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,079
not charging you a dollar but but like

661
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,000
it's it's a common courtesy thing I

662
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,599
would be mortified as the word I would

663
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,519
use to describe it not embarrassed not

664
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,678
ashamed [ __ ] mortified if my neighbor

665
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,839
smelled me every morning yeah and if

666
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,679
you're growing 30 or 40 cannabis plants

667
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,678
as a carer you're putting yourself at

668
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,480
risk your patient's medicine at risk

669
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,919
just having that wafting down the

670
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,360
alley like we already had one kid get

671
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,960
shot in the stomach with an air rifle

672
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,839
this summer because someone's too stupid

673
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,360
they put their [ __ ] in a fence like if

674
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,678
you throw a chain link fence over it

675
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,678
teenagers aren't going to bother they

676
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,640
can barely work scissors let Al freaking

677
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,240
wire cutters most of them are so lazy

678
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,520
that they're not ready to steal unless

679
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,558
it's right in their face anyway right if

680
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:45,119
you're growing in town don't don't push

681
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:47,359
the limits you know I think that's the

682
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,719
the thing we're getting at but right

683
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,479
like all of this is because one guy is

684
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,679
being inconsiderate yes yeah so we're

685
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,679
all going to get punished for that that

686
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
kind of sucks everybody who would like

687
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,798
to grow their own cannabis plants in the

688
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,600
city of PUO now has that right in

689
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:05,000
Jeopardy because one jerk on the south

690
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:06,359
side is stinking up his neighbor's house

691
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,119
but two jerks because somebody had to

692
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,798
shoot somebody also and I'm sure that

693
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:13,839
contributes that's surely not helping

694
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:17,278
anybody and there's another jerk out in

695
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:20,319
uh this uh County I almost said too much

696
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:23,759
of the neighborhood but he he's the the

697
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,439
main thing for um the the county kind of

698
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,960
doing the same thing that or wanting to

699
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,159
do the same thing that the city's going

700
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,840
to do or try to do the count is talking

701
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,679
about proposed plant limits is that

702
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:37,079
right they they are talking limits but

703
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:40,919
um regardless of uh caregiver ship or

704
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:45,359
anything like that it it would be

705
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:47,960
uh [ __ ] I can't 18 plants yeah uh 18

706
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,599
plants per single family residence 12

707
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:55,319
plants per apartment or multif Family

708
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:58,359
Residence um and it uh limits uh or

709
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,079
forbids outdoor growing too so that's

710
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:02,158
you know that's ridiculous especially in

711
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,439
the county the the forbidding of outdoor

712
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:09,000
growing is just a silly gift to Black

713
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,798
Hills that they don't deserve yeah it's

714
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,960
the sun is free abundant energy and

715
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:16,158
plants are meant to be outdoors and the

716
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,759
only reason marijuana was forced indoors

717
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,799
to begin with was

718
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,158
Prohibition um I don't know about you

719
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:23,918
guys but I love some summer outdoor yeah

720
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,200
and you say a lot of ridiculous [ __ ] but

721
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,000
that thing you just said about the only

722
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,319
reason marijuana was forced indoors was

723
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,398
because of prohibition is one of the

724
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,798
greatest things I've ever heard you say

725
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:34,398
every now and then a diamond F falls out

726
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:35,599
along with all the coal yeah dude yeah

727
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:37,719
you're you're kind of full of crap but

728
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,319
once in a while you spit out a real gym

729
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,079
that was and I agree with you and a lot

730
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:43,200
of people moved to Colorado to the

731
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:46,000
Pueblo area to grow outdoors because

732
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,440
this is an ideal climate mhm there's the

733
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,159
reason that uh most of the army uh

734
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,558
troops that have been to Afghanistan and

735
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,600
Iraq uh go through Fort Carson for

736
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,319
training before they go there yeah it

737
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,959
gets them acclimated to the similar

738
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,000
environment we up this altitude the air

739
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,038
is thin the temperature is the same yeah

740
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,960
the Hindu Kush Valley oh does that mean

741
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,960
that when uh when they take over and

742
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,960
they all come here that they're coming

743
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,399
to pbl

744
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,120

there for that and by then uh I was

853
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,599
already well known as the first guy that

854
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,119
bought pot I don't know how everybody

855
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,959
knew already it only been three or four

856
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:15,000
hours there wasn't a lot to talk about

857
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,600
in that line so the news actually came

858
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,558
to my house and filmed us Mike and I and

859

ni and put that on the news yeah I got a

861
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:28,480
little over excited with my first legal

weed purchase as just an adult and and

863
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,639
yeah that was fun I'm glad that uh they

864
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,200
were way more fascinated with the

865
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:37,199
dreadlocks and the dab rig than they

866
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,159
were with the Pasty white guy in the

867
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,519
corner I took uh I took two or three

868
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,679
dabs when the camera crew was here and

869
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,278
uh they put the tiny shitty weak dab on

870

the news oh [ __ ] yeah I was like oh you

871
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:49,558

872
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,000
news if I remember right they didn't

873
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:53,278

874
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,440
either did they yeah it was just a just

875

876
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,000
camera guy was a little lit

877
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:03,959
it wasn't his fault we got carried away

878
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,398

00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,679
how she wished she could smoke but they

883
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,558

885
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,119

921
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,480
to me and yeah it seems like yeah the

922
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,119
story we just told I'm a little Stone so

923
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,679
I'm kind of backtracking but know that's

924
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:47,199
cool we need to uh remind the people

925
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,360
that what's going to happen is the draft

926
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,120
will be presented on October 15th to the

927
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,199
city council what we've got to do is go

928
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:55,839
to the city council meeting on the 13th

929
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,759
and kind of be preemptive show them look

930
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,278
we know this is coming we're here to

931
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,960
infuence you first y uh come up with

932
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:03,839
good reasons why it's [ __ ] and if

933
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,038
you have if you got a speaking voice if

934
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,599
you're not scared to speak in front of

935
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,599
people go speak to the city council it's

936
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,838
a public form explain to them that they

937
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,280
can't make us grow in private buildings

938
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,199
because first that tells the robbers

939
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,320
right where our weed is yep second that

940
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,918
tells your neighbors that you are

941
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,159
actually growing cannabis if they didn't

942
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,319
already know yep third you can't afford

943
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,919
a damn building NP four that's going to

944
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,159
make more electricity for Black Hills to

945
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,559
go wire up that should be number one

946
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,358
okay see all these reasons already add

947
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,480
up second of all what are we doing wrong

948
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,960
there's a couple of people screwing up

949
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,440
go go make those people correct their

950
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,159
things don't punish the whole group for

951
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,159
a couple of people screw-ups this does

952
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,480
nothing to go over the act or try to

953
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,519
attack the actual criminal element that

954
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,119
does happen from some home grows it's

955
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,119
kind of nitpicking isn't it yeah yeah

956
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,079
it's well the the person growing weed in

957
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,679
their home on the black market for sale

958
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,919
on the black market isn't bothering to

959
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,679
follow any of the rules and they're

960
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,118
doing so they're doing everything

961
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,440
covertly because they don't want to get

962
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,358
caught in arrested the people who are

963
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,720
standing up following the letter of the

964
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,039
law but being dickish about it are just

965
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:07,480
bringing a black eye to the whole

966
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,440
community and causing everybody problems

967
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,320
we legalized it if enough idiots screw

968
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,480
up they're going to take that away the

969
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,880
next president could send the [ __ ]

970
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:22,358
Marines like it's not that outlandish

971
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,480
the vision in my head was just like

972
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:27,759
President Romney well remember in Boston

973
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,880

outdoor Garden will get droned in Boston

975
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,920
if we're not careful there was a man

976
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,519
hunt for somebody after the Boston

977
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,838
Marathon bombings and they were going

978
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,599
into every single house and searching

979
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:43,039
every single room looking for these

980
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,760
suspects yep um imagine if they tried to

981

do that here I mean you know I mean no

982
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760

only will happen on the East Coast we're

984
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,560
one of the most DED states there is I

985
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,960

and very gun friendly

988
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,760
I don't know anyone who grew up here

989
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:05,759
that can't like didn't grow up shooting

990

the guns go well with the liberal yeah

991
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,920
if yeah because you have to be able to

992
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,519
protect yourself being so liberal you

993
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,000
have to well there and there's a lot of

994
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,679
places in this state where you can fully

995
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,280
get eaten by a bear still like that's a

996
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,399
thing here 30 minutes from here you can

997
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,079

998
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,880
from here hell they found a moose down

999
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,240
in the river earlier this summer that's

1000
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,480
one of the most deadly creatures in

1001
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:27,799
North America and people do not respect

1002
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,079
the Moose nope it does not have big

1003
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,390
fangs now so they don't get afraid watch

1004
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,640
out for the knuckle part of

1005
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:35,039
[Music]

1006
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,679
it let's give a shout out to Jesse for a

1007
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,119
moose knuckle reference on the show that

1008
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,399
was pretty good I don't I don't know can

1009
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,760
we transition from moose knuckle to let

1010
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,838
me just finish it with saying I'm not

1011
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,480
too afraid to get up get beat up by a

1012
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:48,239
nice moose

1013
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,960
knuckle now let's go to the part you

1014
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:57,159
were going to do um as I blush and rub

1015
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:59,440
my face a little um I need more weed so

1016
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:00,920
one of the things that just kills me is

1017
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,039
Council I'd like to give you a dab but

1018
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,800
on the show you're going to choke for

1019
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:05,440
like 30 minutes give me the tiniest

1020
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,480
little baby girly dab start talking

1021
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,599
while I get them ready I'll take one

1022
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,519
first and by the time you're done I'll

1023
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,760
have a couple dabs going so uh one of

1024
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:15,400
the things that kills me about the

1025
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,000
Cannabis Community is for the last 80

1026
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,720
years or so we've been forced

1027
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,800
underground and into the dark and in out

1028
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:23,759
of the way and out of sight and that's

1029
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,519
how we've survived and that's how we've

1030
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,599
thrived but now that it's

1031
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:33,679
legal more of us need to stand the [ __ ]

1032
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:37,000
up and show up to city council and show

1033
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:39,879
up to vote and show up during budget

1034
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,838
meetings and have our voices heard we're

1035
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,280
used to hiding and pretending like we're

1036
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:49,400
not part of the system and we're against

1037
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:52,720
the system but we live here too it's our

1038
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,639
city too we're we have just as much

1039
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:59,039
right to have our city be like we would

1040
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:02,159
like it as anyone else in the City and

1041
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:04,880
if nobody shows up and speaks out

1042
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,440
against a ban on all hom growing that

1043
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,680
requires you to build a building City

1044
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,559
council's not going to care that it's

1045
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,000
ridiculous and unenforceable and a

1046
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:17,119
horrible idea they're going to go ahead

1047
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,559
and approve it because without thinking

1048
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,200
about it just on a quick gut check it

1049
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:23,000
seems like you ought to have the right

1050
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:25,799
to wake up in the morning and not smell

1051
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
marijuana and this ordinance might do

1052
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,400
that once for somebody Maybe

1053
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,599
so sure go ahead and approve it and if

1054
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,240
nobody's willing to throw on some clean

1055
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:38,039
clothes and show up Monday night at 7:00

1056
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:41,118
and say hey I think this is a really bad

1057
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:43,639
idea and I'd appreciate you not passing

1058
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,480
this ordinance who knows what's going to

1059
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:47,838
happen I mean I think they're going to

1060
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,838
kill it I think that if I show up and

1061
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,519
one or two other people show up and

1062
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,480
speak that they'll go ahead and kill it

1063
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:56,800
on the 15th or next month or whatever

1064
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,000
but who knows nobody's willing to stand

1065
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,720
up and that's part part of the reason

1066
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,318
PUO City doesn't have any medical shops

1067
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:06,239
in it or any recck shops yet because so

1068
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:08,279
far it's just me down at city council

1069
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,159
saying we ought to have these for a

1070
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,760
minute we had a little cannabis

1071
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,039
community group but they fell apart

1072
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,040
pretty quick quite quickly like you

1073
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,838
don't need a group though you just you

1074
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:19,719
just need to be a citizen who's willing

1075
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,880
to show up Monday night at

1076
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:25,318
7 so here's something that I've kind of

1077
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,599
tossed around to my head uh when when

1078
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:28,759
Mike and I had a shop together was owned

1079
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,280
by somebody else but you know we ran

1080
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,160
that place there were a couple times

1081
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,760
where we had to go to court for a couple

1082
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:37,000
of things and uh to support a member of

1083
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,680
our group that had a court trial also we

1084
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,280
went to a couple of city council things

1085
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:45,199
to try to speak up I look like your TP I

1086
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,640
I know it I look like a cliche freaking

1087
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,960
pothead well that's cool it's an enail

1088

1090
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,679
the it's not the first time that's

1091
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,279
happened to tell you the truth I had to

1092
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:59,480
learn how to take dabs with a mic in

1093
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,079
front of me also so I'm talking about I

1094
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,000

allowing more than six people to speak

1127
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,519
at the beginning of most meetings lately

1128
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,480

1136
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,639
two weeks at every single meeting they

1138
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,879
the meeting to stand up and say I don't

illegal I hate you like he takes five

1142
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:54,199
minutes to do that at the beginning of

1143
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,760
every meeting and he sits down and his

1144
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:59,239
crotchety friend gets up and does the

1145
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,800
same thing and and they're not any more

1146
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:04,279
valid or legitimate than you with your

1147
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,359
dreadlocks or Jesse with his beard or me

1148
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,000
with my earrings just cuz I clean up a

1149
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,679
little better than y'all as far as the

1150
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,239
cops are concerned doesn't mean you

1151
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,399
deserve less or more space at city

1152
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,159
council than I

1153
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,440
take the only reason they talk to me is

1154
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,799
cuz I show up all the time and I'm

1155
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,838
familiar face most people leave halfway

1156
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,039
through the meeting and then it's just

1157
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,960
the people that are stuck there playing

1158
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,639
a role in going through the pageantry of

1159
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,400
city government and because I'm willing

1160
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:34,920
to hang out for that last hour I can

1161
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,079
call City Council on 2:00 in the

1162
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,800
afternoon and by 8:00 have talked to

1167
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,358
little spot at the table I like it my

1168
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,119
other question is am I going to attract

1169
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:53,639
unwanted attention to myself like I'm

1170

1188
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,119
they need to worry about now if you show

1189
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,760
up and throw a rock at Sandy daff

1190
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:41,119
they're probably going to pay attention

1191
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,559
to who you are and follow you out of the

1192

building and give you a lot of problems

1193
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,680
but if you stand up and act like a

1194
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,280
citizen they will treat you like a

1195
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,318
citizen because doing so anything else

1196
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,559
is technically a crime can I wear a hat

1197

00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,240
to experience a Mass Exodus of cannabis

1249
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,599
caregivers into the county and with the

1250
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:06,199
fit they've been pitching over one weed

1251
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,800
farm out in whatever that road is I

1252
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:12,039
don't imagine they'd like the 3,000 plus

1253
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,920
caregivers that live in publo county and

1254
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:17,279
have since the medical uh medical

1255
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,880
marijuana program started publishing

1256
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,040
that information about a decade ago like

1257
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,240
all these people are going to have to

1258
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:24,440
pack their [ __ ] up and take it to the

1259
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,479
county and the county ain't ready to

1260
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,079
handle that so County folks show up and

1261
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,639
say this is a terrible idea I'm a

1262
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,200
wellestablished caregiver I've been

1263
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:33,679
caregiving for five or six years

1264
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:35,399
professionally I call myself a

1265
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,440
professional caregiver I do very well at

1266
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:42,440
it my patients love my products right uh

1267
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:44,559
they count on it they rely on it um I've

1268
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,280
got a system designed where I can

1269
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:47,839
provide exactly what they need I know

1270
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,359
when my patients are going to call I

1271
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,799
know when I know when my old friend I

1272
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:53,960
know exactly when he's going to run out

1273
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,920
I know when everybody I've got him

1274
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,720
scheduled to have to redo my grow to

1275
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,400
build another building would cause me to

1276
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:04,919
have to leave this town which would put

1277
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,079
five people that I'm responsible for in

1278
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,920
some deep [ __ ] with their cannabis needs

1279
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,920

1280
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,039
would and where are they going to get it

1281
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,400
because there's not there aren't going

1282
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,679
to be any other caregivers to take my

1283
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,079
spot because they can't grow nope in

1284

people moving here gr store makes a lot

1301
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,000
of money from us yeah yeah I mean can't

1302
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:07,639
lie Jesse just said they wrote a nice

1303
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,880
tax check I wish there was a higher

1304
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:12,519
profit margin on it but through the last

1305
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,079
depression the one gross store on Fourth

1306
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:16,559
Street sprung up what three new

1307
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,839
locations and two new competitors

1308
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:22,760
bloomed yeah the P ain't that big folks

1309
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:24,960
and we've got four now they're five or

1310
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:28,280
six hydro shops H with driving distance

1311
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,679
of here right and there all surviving

1312
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,079
just fine because there's a lot of

1313
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,239
employment bleeding off this industry

1314
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:35,559
yeah I'm going to do a Shameless plug

1315
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,399
right here I've been to all of the hydro

1316
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,440
shops in this town that's no doubt at

1317
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,358
all all of them several times and

1318
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,079
there's a reason why I've chosen one

1319
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:45,960
specific shop to be my

1320
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,720
sponsor

1321
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,880

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,680

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,039

oh not even they're both really antip um

1356
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,879
there was back on the subject of the

1357
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:08,960
proposed ordinance um they mentioned

1358
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,480
something about uh real or uh landlords

1359
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,519
in there and I kind of thought that was

1360
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:17,559
bs2 um I know a couple local landlords

1361
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:19,920
uh one of them has over 30 properties

1362
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:22,000
and the other one has 18 properties and

1363
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,519
some of those are big duplexes or

1364
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,838
apartment buildings um they don't care

1365
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,480
they actually tell their tenants they

1366
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:32,279
don't care that um you know I'm sorry I

1367
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,119
can't name them but um they they don't

1368
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,359
care that's golden information in this

1369
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,318
state you see almost all of their

1370
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:39,159
tenants grow almost all of their tenants

1371
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:42,519
pay rent on time they take care of their

1372
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:45,199
houses uh they love them um they you

1373
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:47,639
know so I don't know where they came up

1374
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:49,798
with landlords are pissed about this but

1375
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:51,798
that it's because no one in the industry

1376
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:54,159
stands up if you're on city council or

1377
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:57,838
if you're the police chief or the fire

1378
00:50:54,159 --> 00:51:00,118
chief you don't meet caregivers like you

1379
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,480
two you meet the caregiver who set his

1380
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:05,079
[ __ ] house on fire you meet the

1381
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,880
caregiver who got to or got drunk at the

1382
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:10,720
bar and backed into the somebody's car

1383
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,880
with three lbs in the trunk and like the

1384
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,480
guting in the backyard right yeah

1385
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,640
somebody who blew their garage apart

1386
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,240
open blasting and smoking a cigarette at

1387
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:22,598
the same time that's a good point um and

1388
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:24,399
because you guys are good at what you do

1389
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:27,720
and you've never blown yourself up or

1390
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,480
set your house on fire they've never met

1391
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,879
you they've never heard of you they've

1392
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,159
never seen pictures of your garden if I

1393
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,960
could take pictures of your grow room

1394
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:40,078
and take them to city council I could

1395
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,798
give them an idea of what looking or

1396
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,680
what doing it right looks like because

1397
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:45,440
they've only ever seen the one that the

1398
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:47,759
cops got called on and the cops took

1399
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,039
pictures of I mean that's part of the

1400
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,880
problem there unless you're reading High

1401
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,838

00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:31,279

going to go nice I think uh it was about

1423
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,399
45 minutes to get there I think your

1424
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,480
travel time was more than what you spent

1425
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:50,200
there yeah probably so yeah but it uh

1426
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,960

1427

little town on the map bro yeah and see

1436
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,039
I mean for something so positive too

1437
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,880
we're always on the map for some

1438
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:16,679
psychotically horrid [ __ ] it's so nice

1439
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,960
when it's positive you know um another

1440
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:20,679
thing I just want to say is most

1441
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,838
caregivers basements I've seen that's

1442
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:27,159
just a general term for where their grow

1443
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:29,920
is um most of them are way cleaner than

1444
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:32,480
most dispensaries uh grows I've seen

1445
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,159
that's just the honest truth nine days

1446
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,240
out of 10 I'd be happy eating off Jeff's

1447
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:39,199
growroom floor I'm kind of I've got a

1448
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:41,679
little bit of OCD and that plays very

1449
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,318
well being a pot farmer it does it plays

1450
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:44,960
and you'll notice my front yard is clean

1451
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:46,759
my backyard is clean the sides of my

1452
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,559
house are clean I asked my neighbors

1453
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,200
neighbors to remove some debris they had

1454
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,680
over there they had a trailer with like

1455
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:52,879
old wood they had chopped down and they

1456
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:54,679
didn't take it away for a long time I

1457
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,720
was like I ha to be a stickler but could

1458
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:58,159
you possibly take away that wood and if

1459
00:53:56,719 --> 00:53:59,519
you need some more reasons why I'll let

1460
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,759
you know why it's bugging me they're

1461
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,639
like I'm sorry we'll get rid of it and

1462
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,440
they took cuz it's bugs dude I don't

1463
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:07,639
need every little board uh my weeds are

1464
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,760
pulled all the time my garden my back

1465
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:11,159
backyard garden is clean uh because I

1466
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,799
can't afford the bugs that that will

1467
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:14,039
bring that'll bring more problems and it

1468
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:15,960
also makes your house look like [ __ ] and

1469
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:18,119
being a pot grower I want to be a good

1470
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,039
citizen and not make my house look like

1471
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,280
[ __ ] I mean that's part of the thing no

1472
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:25,880
one sees this no one sees how well most

1473
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,400
of the industry does it they uh most of

1474
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,240
City Council hasn't bothered to go out

1475
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,880
and visit any of the legal marijuana

1476
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,558
stores in town some of which have been

1477
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,680
open for like 78 years now I mean how

1478
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,920
long's Marisol been open and they can't

1479
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:41,358
make that drive I mean it's not exactly

1480
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,240
the best example I could have thrown out

1481
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,838
but like it's been there the longest and

1482
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:46,719
that's the first dispensary we got to in

1483
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:48,719
PUO we got to give them credit it's the

1484
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:50,639
first and I mean you can't go out there

1485
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,078
and check if if it's something that's so

1486
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:53,519
scary and should be fought like

1487
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,200
shouldn't you understand your opponent

1488
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:57,199
to kill it or at least some nonsense

1489
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,480
like that and go see it once some Jedi

1490
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:01,239
[ __ ] right there bro but it's so scary

1491
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,980
if they see it from the parking lot

1492
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:05,279
they'll have to go in and inject some

1493
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,119
[Music]

1494
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,040
marijuanas oh watch out they're going to

1495
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,358
turn gay guys if you're growing indoors

1496
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:14,000
it will walk into your grow room and

1497
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:17,440
close your eyes and breathe and if it

1498
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,679
smells like wet or smells like plants

1499
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,358
you're doing it wrong you need more

1500
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:21,879
ventilation you need more air out and

1501
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:23,358
more fresh air in you don't want to be

1502
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,838
able to smell that [ __ ] in your own grow

1503
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,519
room you shouldn't be able to smell it

1504
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:28,159
in there

1505
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:29,480
this random grow tip has been brought to

1506
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:31,318
you by our genetics I'm just thinking

1507
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,559
about filtration and [ __ ] if we're going

1508
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:35,199
to grow indoors yeah I got to order a

1509
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:36,160
couple carbon filters by the way if

1510
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,519
we're going to be growing indoors and

1511
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:38,920
doing it right that's that's how you

1512
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,759
know you're not putting humidity and

1513
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,838
mildew problems into the house and

1514
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,880
that's how you know you're filtering it

1515
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,199
to your neighbors aren't going to

1516
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,400
complain I blew a guy's mind the other

1517
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:50,279
day uh sold him an INT a carbon filter

1518
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,160
for the intake that so sweet what I

1519
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,798
first told him about it he was like

1520
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:59,318
sounds like a waste of money and within

1521
00:55:54,798 --> 00:56:01,639
45 seconds he was like oh wo oh wow yeah

1522
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:03,599
it's like dude it even like it makes

1523
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:06,639
your light pulps last longer I mean it's

1524
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,720
everything it's just it's better yeah

1525
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,679
yeah carbon filters guys uh carbon

1526
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,239
scrubbers if you're not using it to just

1527
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:14,159
uh pull the air out of the room that

1528
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,519
you're growing in put a filter with a

1529
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:16,598
blower in there just right in the middle

1530
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,280
of the room either on the floor or

1531
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:19,920
hanging in the ceiling to keep the air

1532
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,039
clean and keep air moving you can't have

1533
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,079
too much air flow in your grow room you

1534
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:26,000
really can't random tips from some pros

1535
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,599
today and we have really good air here

1536
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,480
too

1537
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:32,798
had everyone in town taken that advice

1538
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,599
at the beginning of the summer we would

1539
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:37,719
not be here recording this

1540
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:40,240
episode I'm I'm a a really you know I'm

1541
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:42,279
an outdoor grower um it it's hard to

1542
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:43,798
keep that stink away I I don't have a

1543
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,760
good suggestion at the same time have

1544
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:48,960
you ever had a

1545
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,160
neighbor no but where where I

1546
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:55,240
where well no i' I've been in many back

1547
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:57,759
door or backyard gardens back Jesus

1548
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:59,279
unstone I've been in many backyard Gard

1549
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,240
got something weird on your mind yeah

1550
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,720
kind of and

1551
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:07,038
uh I haven't seen a lot of pissed off

1552
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:10,919
Neighbors on either side generally

1553
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:15,520
Because unless you're doing it in large

1554
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:17,599
quantities or you're really good at it

1555
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,038
you're not going to produce a level of

1556
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:24,039
stink that's there for more than two

1557
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:25,680
weeks at any sort of obnoxious level I

1558
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:27,319
mean we're not talking more than like

1559
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,000
the dog [ __ ] from the guy next door who

1560
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:31,199
hasn't raked it up in a couple of weeks

1561
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,760
or the compost pile that's baking in the

1562
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:37,078
sun type odor here it's not that strong

1563
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:40,039
it's just

1564
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:41,599
peculiar and unless you're a real dick

1565
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,760
your neighbor's not going to call the

1566
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,440
cops and every member of city council

1567
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:49,039
instead of you also they're also those

1568
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,880
people that claim just the smell of pot

1569
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,000
makes me sick I get a headache and I

1570
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,680
think that's [ __ ] because I've

1571
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,920
smelled some all kinds of [ __ ] and no

1572
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,159
smells have ever really given me a

1573
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,720
headache uh just smelling something

1574
00:57:57,159 --> 00:58:01,159
probably that's but there are some

1575
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,879
people that love to cling to a problem

1576
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:05,798
or a well right now there's a lot of

1577
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,440
people looking for anything about

1578
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:10,599
marijuana to gripe about which we're

1579
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,440
seeing a lot of out in PUO West right

1580
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:14,680
now and these folks that are stinking

1581
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:17,280
out their neighbors are really you're

1582
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:18,919
hurting the cause man we we succeeded

1583
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,200
and we got full legalization and now

1584
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,200
we've got people looking to throw

1585
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:24,480
anchors at us and it sucks good job on

1586
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:27,078
the stink but man turn it down my

1587
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,318
in-laws live in public West every Sunday

1588
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:31,680
we go out there and eat dinner with him

1589
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:34,400
um I grew up out there so or well I went

1590
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:36,239
to high school out there um I drive

1591
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,680
around and stuff like that uh take

1592
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,919
different roads every single time I can

1593
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:43,919
find two or three plants sticking above

1594
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:47,480
the fence uh there's a place out there

1595
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:49,240
uh his hoop houses he have in his

1596
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,559
backyard kind of remind me of what

1597
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:53,598
Greener Side looks

1598
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:56,119
like you know I

1599
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,640
mean they're they're they're pushing it

1600
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:01,358
they're pushing the limits they're being

1601
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:02,960
[ __ ] um and that sucks I thought

1602
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:04,558
about go to the mountains I thought

1603
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,280
about doing some plants in my backyard I

1604
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,640
was going to buy one of those 10x10 dog

1605
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,480
runs and a little greenhouse and put the

1606
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,879
greenhouse inside the dog run but uh

1607
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,440
like seven out of 10 Growers that have

1608
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,240
grown some outdoor pot this year have

1609
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,200
either had caterpillars or thieves in

1610
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:20,639
this neighborhood and I'm just going to

1611
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:22,639
pass on the outdoor one of the things

1612
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:26,279
most people don't take into account for

1613
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:28,598
the outdoor is you're giving up like 90%

1614
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:32,200
your control to so that you can also

1615
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:34,798
give up 90% of your energy cost and 99%

1616
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:37,798
of your control well yeah

1617
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:40,358
95 yeah you would be much more qualified

1618
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:42,519
to speak on this and

1619
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:44,000
environmentally you can do weather and

1620
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:45,838
bugs are going to kick your ass all

1621
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,519
summer long I mean I just grew a bunch

1622
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:49,759
of veggies outdoor this year and the

1623
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,400
weather and the bugs pretty much killed

1624
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,599
me but I still got a massive Harvest

1625
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,119

1627
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,960
two truck fulls of

1628
00:59:56,679 --> 01:00:00,838
old pot dirt mix it with sand so it

1629
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,119
holds water a little better I mixed it

1630
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:05,558
with that clay crap Pueblo was built on

1631

ever bring up a pot ordinance again if

1719
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:26,440
we had 80 people show up they would do

1720
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:29,920
whatever we

1721
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:32,318
asked if we had five people show up this

1722
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,920
ordinance would never see the light of

1723

01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:48,879
somebody would make me a super cool

1811
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:51,920
theme about 2 minutes long maybe uh say

1812
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,720
a few key phrases I gr culture podcast

up to you in some sort of way depending

1816
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:01,199
on what state you live in and how old

1817
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:02,558
you are we could work on a little

1818
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:04,278
compensation but there would definitely

1819
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,480
be some pay in there I'm not begging I

1820

just need a theme song I'm tired of

1821
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,960
listening to that cheesy ree tune I made

1822
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:12,318
and I've been putting the show on you on

1823
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,440
YouTube and YouTube gets mad at me for

1824
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:15,759
using all those other people's songs

1825
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,838
I've got their written permission all

1826
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,440
the artists that I use I've got

1827
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:20,199
permission proving that to Google's

1828
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,559
tricky exactly they don't even care if

1829
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:22,719
you do prove it they're like that email

1830
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:24,480
doesn't mean [ __ ] to us we need a

1831
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,919

1832
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,240

1836
01:07:32,358 --> 01:07:35,239
like hey can I use your music and like

1837

1838
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:38,719
know they've said yes but that's as far

1839
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,720
as we've gotten yeah you can't play

1840
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:42,399
Google that voicemail that's right so

1841
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:43,798
somebody if you want to write I like ree

1842
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,318
obviously if you wanted to write a

1843
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:46,798
couple of them that'd be badass maybe

1844
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:48,759
one for the start of the show one for

1845
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:51,199
the end of the show maybe a short piece

1846
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,960
for like between segments uh something

1847
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:54,759
with a real aggressive dance hall ree

1848
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,079
beat would be pretty smooth I don't know

1849
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,240
I'm just begging at this point I could

1850
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:59,720
use a theme song that's what I'm trying

1851

1852
01:07:59,719 --> 01:08:04,318
so you know he's a big Slayer fan so

1853
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:05,639
anything with there's nothing like

1854
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:08,519
getting real high and just listening to

1855
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:11,078
a thousand beats per minute in your head

1856
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:14,318
