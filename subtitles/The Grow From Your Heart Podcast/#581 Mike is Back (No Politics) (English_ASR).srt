intimately familiar with that snow

50
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,519

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
ounce mountain dew bottle

52
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,200

53
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,919
that bottle getting filled up and by the

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,359
end of the day

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
it wasn't filled up it was just stacked

56
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,280
up along the side

57
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,920
it was about 12 ounces deep by the time

58
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920

59

like a decade ago

62
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,359
came out of nowhere it came out of

63
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,880
nowhere it was like hey we might get

64
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,239
some snow tomorrow and then

65
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,560

76
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400

77
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
of the ground

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,439

82
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,199
out of the ground

83
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,199

89
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319

freaking cold it is it is a cold

92
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,280

00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,039
for the night

94
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,039
another great way to set the tone is to

95
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,439

96

describe the flavor as lemons

119
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,079
lemons and even more lemons i've talked

120
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,158
about this on the podcast

121
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
[ __ ] agree dude it's lemontastic

122
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,598
those lemon perps are my friend my

123
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,359
favorite they work with my uh

124
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,119
i've got a brain injury it still exists

125
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,599
it's still i've got weird lingering

126
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
[ __ ] fuzzies from it it was years ago

127
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,438
years ago if you know the years ago joke

128
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,519
shout out in a fist bump but years ago

129
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,799
i had a brain injury some lingering

130
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,879
effects occasionally

131
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,280
i've noticed the lemony limonene type

132
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,798
terps kind of correct some of the

133
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,839
in my opinion i don't know you may see

134
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,279
differently on that from another

135
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
perspective but i feel like it kind of

136
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,079
fixes

137
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,599
my glitches my skips like uh if your

138
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,240
brain is a [ __ ] record i've got a

139
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,320
little

140
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,079
little skip somewhere and occasionally

141
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,360
some songs it'll just it'll just it'll

142
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,120
just and you got to nudge the record

143
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,319
player to get it going that's my brain

144
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,319
i feel like the limit

145
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,918
it wipes off the scratch on my cd or it

146
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,040
fills in the scratch on my record or

147
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,120
whatever and it makes my

148
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,560
uh my brain flow a little more smoothly

149
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,478
my beats don't have that weird skip

150
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,759
remember when you would download music

151
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:52,639
from uh limewire and occasionally

152
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,759
you [ __ ] boom and chat camp boom chat

153
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,800
and then occasionally you're

154
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,160
in the middle of the song and you're

155
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,879
like oh [ __ ] you have a little seizure

156
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,240
from it

157
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,839
that's what my brain does occasionally

158
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,000
you'll hear the beat will be smooth and

159
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,359
then the middle the b you get

160
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,120
just this weird [ __ ] up note that

161
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,360
doesn't belong there this makes those

162
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,959
notes go away this the lemony terps

163
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,240
makes that not happen so that's where

164
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,319
i'm headed with all that [ __ ]

165
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,280
rambles

166
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,399
this is your regular advisement to avoid

180
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,560
older part of town

181
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,319
where um there's a word that they use to

182
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,360
describe the people the descendants from

183
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,800
this part of the world i don't know if

184
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
it's a derogatory term but they call

185
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
themselves that here but those people

are very short

187
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,360
they're smaller people and the houses

188
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,919
here were built for those shorter people

189
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,960

and we knew it was gonna happen but he

359
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,919
lost his mind when those poor little

360
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,600
fingers started warming up

361
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,599

were exhausted yep so a couple of dabs

367
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
in a podcast seemed like the perfect way

368
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
to wrap up the day

369
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,200

along with my kovid garden

373
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,240

374
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,680
of broccoli the size of my

375
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,159
five-year-old's head

376
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,078

00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,399

476
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
remember that he's a soldier so uh when

477
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,078
he realized it was a soldier he

478
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,759
definitely felt uh some compassion and

479
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,599
wanted to help out some camaraderie

480
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,600

veteran i don't know how to do that

505
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,440
keith knew how to do it because

506
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,000
he said as soon as he spoke to another

507
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,000
veteran they would know

508
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,919

847
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,440
episode

848
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,440
uh but really all of the interaction all

849
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,200
that support i've had a lot of fun

850
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,400
i know it's been a podcast filled with

851
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,679
shout outs we've been going for almost

852
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,278
25 minutes here

853
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,038
i haven't really done a lot of cannabis

854
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,440
related content but we need to catch up

855
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,038
after the last show that we did people

856
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,480
are there's a couple people out there

857
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,798
with their cheeks clenched wondering

858
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,400
which direction the shell is gonna turn

859
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,240
yeah i think it's gonna be rambles are

860
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,320
they gonna do cannabis stuff is mike

861
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,159
gonna do another politics rant

862
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,599
i think it's just gonna be gonna happen

863
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,080
yourself and uh

864
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,359
us getting your audience back i feel

865
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,359
like i may have lost a couple of people

866
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,278
because that last episode honestly

867
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,199
we lost to the right people it's fine

868
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,880
yeah it's that's the thing about people

869
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,960
who jump off the boat like they

870
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,760
clearly didn't want to be here if y'all

871
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,519
made it to 570 sub episodes and hadn't

872
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,240

873
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,079
liberal

874
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,278

recording properly in one of our devices

952

but when i saw your face i definitely

955
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,399
knew that a

956
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,479
spot for an idiot we'll just have to

957
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,678
double listen sorry folks yeah we may

958
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,599
not even take that out they may get to

959
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,519
see that little behind the scenes part

960
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,759
it's snowing like a son of a [ __ ] it's

961
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,480
a six degrees outside

962
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,919
we're liable to get some tanks i think

963
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,839
the first time we tried one of these

964
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,200
zoom podcasts i called it a bunker

965
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,038
session and

966
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,960
it feels more and more like that every

967
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,960
every time we do one but

968
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,000
i think we got the technology figured

969
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
out mostly hopefully

970
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,079
i sound really good in everybody's ears

971
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,959
this week um there's a new piece of tech

972
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:24,319
that should be bringing my volume up

973
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,519
yeah it's snowing like a beast outside

974
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,359
and we can't do anything about the

975
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,278
internet connection so

976
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,959
we're trying folks we really are we're

977
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,798
having fun though we are having fun

978
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,798

979
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,440

00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,000
of things that may happen

987
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,558
uh thank you for the compliments but i

988
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,720
know we can do better and it is time

989
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,240
in place um i don't want to talk too

990
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,679
much about it here because i just want

991
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,798
to say that things are in place

992
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,640
and patreon will see it first i can't i

993
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,480
can't wait for us to be podcasting from

994
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,679
the same space again

995
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,798
like there is something lost when it's

996
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,720
i'm staring at a

997
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,798
screen with lights in my face there's

998
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,558
just that millisecond of social like is

999
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,839
he done talking do i talk now do i talk

1000
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,519
over him like there's that one

1001
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,759
millisecond that we both hesitate

1002
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,798
so yeah i mean it's a lot harder to

1003
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,839
deduce over

1004
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,519
over zoom than it is in in person and uh

1005
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,119
just hanging out with you for a brief

1006
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,879

chit chat with

1045
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,880

and could get me in trouble and i might

1057

not want to do that anymore

anymore

1151
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,679
i would base my time off of events that

1152
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,080
happened like well it had to be

1153
