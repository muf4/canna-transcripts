not English class which is cool because

70
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,709
we get a little weed a little ridiculous

71
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,439
on that yeah we went to the cannabis cup

72
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,329
the US cannabis cut I think it's the

73
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,538
High Times us cannabis cup in Denver

74
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:28,060
where anybody 21 and over was able to

75
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:30,399
hang out freely smoke cannabis with us

76
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,949
dabs where available cannabis was

77
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,038
available we were having a grand old

78
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:35,038
time

79
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:38,869
so the first day I guess we'll get kind

80
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,329
of into that the first day we got there

81
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,649
we stood in line for two hours which

82
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:44,089
sounds like it would suck but studied

83
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,500
through the men that was kind of it

84
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:47,299

87
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,560
dabbing in the parking lot it's sort of

88
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,329
a kind of reminded me a lot of my old

89
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,699
school fish to our widespread panic to

90
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,930
our days that's where we just hang out

91
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,849
in the water all day and make friends

92
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:09,410
and get down kind of do with what you

93
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:10,610
had there we met people from seven or

94
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,710
eight different states just while we

95
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,660
were hanging in line for two hours hey

96
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,799
Sean that's my buddy Sammy for a little

97
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,300
bit of help there we needed some help

98
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,710
for a minute and Sam helped us that was

99
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,418
really cool too bro really appreciate

100
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:24,859
that all day that's a cool guy the shout

101
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:26,689
out Sammy show it to the weed nerd crew

102
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,970
and there was no drama at the Cannabis

103
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:30,649
Cup I didn't see any ridiculous like

104
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,380
crazy drama I saw one girl look like

105
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:34,909
she's having a she might be passing out

106
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:36,918
kind of a moment they had to kind of put

107
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,660
her in a chair like but that was the

108
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:39,829
scariest sure and I saw all weekend for

109
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,180
the most part people seem to behave

110
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:43,359
themselves and take good care of

111
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,360
themselves

112
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:56,120
yeah I think they really really improved

113
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,519
the Cannabis Cup this year last year it

114
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,449
was crowded it almost gave heard a lot

115
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,649
of people saying they're having panic

116
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,000
attacks because it was just too damn

117
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,228
crowded this year you were able to move

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,959
around you were able to get to the

119
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:08,959
booths they gave out a pretty nice map

120
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:11,689
they told you where where who was where

121
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,180
who was on first if you will we're not

122
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:15,439
even gonna go down that rabbit hole so

123
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,970
it was a big shout out to those guys

124
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,288
they did a really cool really cool

125
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,460
improvement everything was nice and

126
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:25,699
smooth it was easy to get through there

127
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:27,978
wasn't a vegetarian food option that I

128
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,779
could find but I guess that's my own

129
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:31,310
dumb ass I don't need to complain about

130
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:33,379
that if I can find some vegetarian food

131
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,030
there would have been an oasis I had ice

132
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:36,050
cream for lunch which kind of made me

133
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,959
feel like [ __ ] by the end of the day

134
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,509
that's my only gripe I guess with the

135
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,668
whole thing it was worth it because I

136
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,500
got to see all of my friends old and new

137
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:47,818
sure if I wanted to list all the people

138
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,379
that I saw there and say hi to everybody

139
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,539
this show would be four hours long

140
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,830
because Kevin and I we spent more time

141
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:54,180
just stopping and saying hey what's up

142
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:57,538
man good to see a good to meet you like

143
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,918
it was a great time we got through the

144
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:02,250
first day and it was hot we roamed

145
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,359
around we uh we were only there for a

146
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,098
couple of minutes before we started

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,310
bumping into people but then it rained

148
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:09,990
so everybody kind of sought shelter we

149
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,879
ran into this little building and that

150
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,710
kind of cleared out a lot of the large

151
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,849
chaotic crowd for the first day so Kevin

152
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,318
and I felt like we had a lot of the

153
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:18,750
place to ourselves I felt like it was

154
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,939
mostly the true you know like people

155
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,288
that had a booth and like that yeah so

156
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,759
we ended up we're walking through and

157
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:25,318
this guy named swerve swerving he's a

158
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,479
owner of the callee connection he kind

159
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,710
of calls us over it is booth and we

160
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:30,120
thought he wanted to chat he actually

161
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,408
wanted to hang out with us he invited us

162
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,060
to the back of his booth we did a few

163
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:34,468
dabs

164
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,829
ended up hanging out with Addison demora

hatch that kept mail and that's that

244

245
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:58,269
to smoke a lot of hash yeah they get to

246
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,240
definitely Addison hit it right

247
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:03,819
afterward and did a very similar

248
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,350
reaction he's the one one actually

249
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,790
pointed me out to Darby's glass

250
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,028
he doesn't like showing me this rig is

251
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:11,740
like come here yeah so that was a huge

252
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:13,149
honor just to be invited to hang out in

253
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,379
the back of the Cal connection booth I

254
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:18,519
don't know how we managed that

255
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:20,470
and then Saturday was chaos it wasn't it

256
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,199
was controlled chaos but Saturday about

257
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,000
three 350 I realized four twenties

258
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,620
creeping up we should find a nice spot

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,539
to hang out take some dad's and it was

260
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,250
it was a hectic place it's like a State

261
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,599
Fair based around weed and I don't mean

262
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,490
to downplay it but you know you got your

263
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,750
booths you got all your vendors lined up

264
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,519
and there's a grid of people just

265
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,350
rushing left and right everyone's trying

266
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,909
to get from place to place we wanted to

267
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,460
find a nice cool spot to take some gaps

268
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:43,838
or 4/20 and something my mind said that

269
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,870
Cali connection booth had two really

270
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,130
cool couches so we uh we wandered

271
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,778
towards enter we could see from one

272
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:53,139
angle that those couches were completely

273
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:54,669
empty and there happen to be well that

274
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:57,250
was Sunday sorry sorry yeah it was

275
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:58,899

276
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,240

chatter on the table for the weekend and

282
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,600

283
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:18,100
bit better that's cool so Sunday by the

284

lot of people hate on those I know that

321

but it sticks out if you play a sport

322
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,909
imagine the biggest star if you play

323
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,950
basketball imagine Michael Jordan

324
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:42,539
inviting you into his house and play

325
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:48,390

330
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,800
fellow readers are ignoring customers to

331
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:03,539
come run over to you and talk to you for

332
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:06,870
a moment that's kind of neat to see yeah

333
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:11,458
I really enjoyed getting all the ceramic

334
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:13,289
products they're really impressed with

335
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:17,069
the ceramic brothers I wasn't sure if I

336
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:19,769
would be but I have been very impressed

337
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,690
so we don't get your hands on some

338
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:26,220

341
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:32,338

342
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:34,528
start of next week we're gonna actually

343
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,970
all have you bring over your ceramic and

344
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:37,250
we'll do a little review on the show and

345
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,379
we'll see how you think a week later

346
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,850
yeah I'm gonna I'm curious about it it

347
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,740
did taste good it seemed kind of clean

348
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,199
only took dad's off it but I'm a little

349
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,579
partial to the titanium I'm afraid I'm

350
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,829
gonna break that ceramic that's my

351
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:55,370
biggest fear but I don't want to take

352
00:14:50,830 --> 00:15:01,190
there you go your personal alright yeah

353
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:02,919
on my pendant I take it around there you

354
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,120
go yeah

355
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:06,979
I'm looking for someone music here I

356
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,269
know what I want to find it's easier to

357
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,100
play it off in this way than doing it

358
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:12,110
the other way you're gonna play a little

359
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,389
bit of task this episode and fun seeing

360
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,210
him got a little a great vibe for buck

361
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:20,299
the background I hate it that uh YouTube

362
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,560
plays commercials now it's obnoxious so

363
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:24,409
my favorite part of the cannabis cup

364
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,449
collectively I think would be just the

365
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:28,309
unity that I felt the welcome miss and

366
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,650
the unity and it felt like we're

367
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:31,579
actually uh we're getting somewhere

368
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:33,139
you know we've been going all these

369
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,490
events we've been one we've been working

370
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,659
our asses off people don't see what the

371
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,820
hash companies doing with the seed

372
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:38,959
breeders do as much but and we're

373
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,370

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,600
Facebook saying that she wasn't having a

394
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,099
good time in Colorado and that there

395
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,930

398
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:39,689
very happy when we last

399
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,399

I usually just pop the chair up next to

432
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:16,388
him it's usually a pretty bouquet so

433
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:22,519

454
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:11,179
would recommend it to anybody it was so

455
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:13,879
good the price was reasonable it was

456

just delicious the waiter was super cool

457
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:16,459

458
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:18,259

533

BOOM we'll announce some winners all

534
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,839
right so they did a lot of awards they

535
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,430
did edibles they did concentrates they

536
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,730
did booth we're just gonna read you the

537
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:19,250
flowers and they did two separate

538
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,230
categories there was the medical and the

539
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,089
u.s. competition the medical competition

540
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,519

available to anyone 18 and over that can

543
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:33,319
afford to enter and felt like doing so

544
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:35,929
so the best medical hybrid hybrid is a

545
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:38,539
not indica not sativa but a nice blend

546

it can't be more than 70% leaning me

547
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:42,379

00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:52,759
into that cannabis saved her life and

814
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:54,770
she she gives that back every day I

815
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,329
think being involved in what she does so

816
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:58,519
much definitely so much love and respect

817
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:01,579
to natural mystic cannabis caregivers in

818
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:05,089
Colorado Springs they also won best

819
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:07,399
medical non-solid hash for first place

820
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:11,750
with the blueberry waltz awesome

821
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,909
non-solvent hash that's your my hash guy

822
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,679
bro even let's uh we're both back down

823
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:20,148
here a little bit but explain non

824
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:23,750
seulement hash is just they don't use

825
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:25,398
any solvents nothing is dissolved the

826
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,889
plant matter they essentially use cold

827
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:30,668
temperatures and ice to freeze keep

828
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:34,419
plant matter frozen not good track bones

829
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:37,398
off of the plant and to be able to

830
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:40,069
separate using filters to attract

831
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:43,668
Coneheads from the trichome tails and

832
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:47,930
then they make pure forms at high slacks

833
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:50,449
by swags and reduce

834
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:52,579
did they lay it out them and flatten on

835
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:53,839
parchment and dry it for several days so

836
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:55,940
there's no chemicals there are no

837
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:59,630
chemicals used in it only water is water

838
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,849
so the the other option is solve

839
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,950
attached which would usually be BHO or

840
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:06,409
butane honey oil which is made with or

841
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:08,210
co2 the BHO is made with butane and the

842
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:09,589
co2 is made with compressed co2 of

843
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:12,289
course and there's ISO that's made with

844
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,850
isopropyl alcohol so this is non solvent

845
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:16,070
which means it's made with essentially

846
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:18,079
ice and water and some people I'm gonna

847
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:20,720
cut you off don't even go there you're

848
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,069
gonna say but water is a solvent yes we

849
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,230
do understand that but in this case

850
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,390
water is not being used as a solvent I'm

851
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,889
kind of quoting Nick a tea I'm giving

852
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:30,469
credit to this statement writer to make

853
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:32,089
a tea this is not my teachings nicotine

854
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:34,969
has taught me that water is not being

855
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:36,890
used as a solvent in water hash or ice

856
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:38,509
hash it is simply being used as a

857
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:40,819
separator and a carrier because what

858
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,160
we're trying to do work 3do we're

859
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,840
freezing the trichomes basically and you

860
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:46,069
knock them off of the plant matter like

861
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,570
how do you get gum out of your hair

862
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,650
remember back in the day you just freeze

863
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,750
the gum and it comes out of your hair

864
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,730
kinda it does the same thing the

865
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,079
trichomes and oils will fall off of the

866
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,059
plant so you're not using it as a

867
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,159
solvent it's a carrier and it's not

868
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:00,320
dissolving it's just better to freeze

869
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,899
its what is it then you're extracting it

870
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,309
from the plant material so I did that

871
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,200
all I probably said that all wrong but

872
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:07,610
it's not a solvent in this case because

873
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:10,039
it's not being used to dissolve we're

874
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:12,170
washing something essentially right yeah

875
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:13,579
shout out to nicotine he kind of he

876
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,960
taught me better than that I just can't

877
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:16,190
remember exactly what I said I should go

878
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,070
google it so that I could get it right

879
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:28,250
for him but make it to use nicotine is

880
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:30,230
awesome at that right here on the screen

881
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,480
it says second place sour lemon OG

882
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,210
solvent list from essential extracts and

883
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,639
trill alternatives and then right here

884
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,559
best US non seulement hash white OG

885
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:41,269
solvent less wax from essential extracts

886
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:44,779
and down with Derby Hashanah - down with

896
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,199
future

897
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:03,990
I predict

898
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:05,309
I predict that so uh 4/20 weekend

899
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:11,339
happened right did anybody hear about

900
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:13,440
that no not only was there the cannabis

901
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,380
cup but there was also a big event at

902
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,059
Civic Center Park in Denver there were a

903
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,700
few bands set up there's actually an

904
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,079
area where they were selling alcohol

905
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:23,909
which we ranted about that on the first

906
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,869
on the last podcast we did we don't

907
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:29,009
approve of that and I hope nobody drank

908
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,569
Kevin had a couple of friends that went

909
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,060
to the event at Civic Center Park and

910
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:34,800
how did you say that they felt about it

911
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:36,989
yeah the people I've talked to everyone

912
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,660
said very much it was really boring and

913
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:43,049
they felt very uncomfortable unlike past

914
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:45,259
years with all the fencing and security

915
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,130
and all that stuff they like they

916
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,050
commented that it made them feel like

917
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:53,039
they were in it in like a prison yard

918
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:56,039
and they were extremely uncomfortable so

919
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,050
I saw a tweet that said with all of

920
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,880
these barricades and things if somebody

921
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,519
shoots this year all we're going to do

922
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,780
is trample each other yeah yeah that's

923
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:06,119
pretty ridiculous

924
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,620
that I wasn't there I can't judge it but

925
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,239
I think you guys are getting the wrong

926
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,009
idea of how we need to have our cannabis

927
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:14,429
events need to come look at a cannabis

928
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:16,950
cup and see how that was done I think

929
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:19,409
there were 40,000 people there there had

930
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:20,849
to be 50 I'm gonna guess there were

931
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:23,759
40,000 people there but this was a

932
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:25,589
cannabis event and everybody's

933
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,540
everybody's friend did a cannabis event

934
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,650
if I would have been patient enough we

935
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,059
both would have gotten in what's a

936
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,320
wristband you know what I mean we just

937
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,610
didn't want to hunt around and find the

938
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,550
right people we wanted to get in there

939
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,110
so everybody's bringing in a homey like

940
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,789
every vendor got so I'm sure there were

941
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:41,340
50,000 people in that place I'm gonna

942
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:43,349
guess 40 to 50,000 people and I didn't

943
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,150
see any problems there was no need for a

944
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:46,559
major security and I can agree that too

945
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,940
much security to be intimidating you're

946
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,599
just trying to get stoned and chill out

947
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:53,909
participate yeah they come dressed for

948
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,150
war we come dressed for a party right

949
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:59,309
all right well by late afternoon at the

950
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,530
4/20 rally in Denver Denver police had

951
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:03,029
issued 47 citations for public marijuana

952
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:05,280
consumption at the downtown rally as

953
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:07,470
well as 16 other arrests or citations

954
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,510
for other reasons Denver Health Medical

955
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:11,189
Center paramedics had treated 14 people

956
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:14,460
including three who were taken to

957
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:16,260

cartoons to watch yeah I hope those were

962
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,990
being too drunk

963
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:32,519
yeah the hospital's emergency room had

964
00:39:30,989 --> 00:39:33,929
treated about half a dozen people most

965
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,940
of whom had passed out through a

966
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:37,940
combination of Sun and substance abuse

967
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:44,129
those people that don't use the

968
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:45,539
elevation water yeah if you don't drink

00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:01,350
would assume that a lot of those people

976
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,450
are I pick on Texas a lot so let's say

977
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:05,069
some people from Nebraska it weren't

978
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:06,599
used to being up so high and they wanted

979
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,039
to get dad down they just ended up

980
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,170
dropping like flies

981
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,929
by the way what I'm reading comes from

982
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:17,400
the Denver Post I just want to give them

983
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:18,659
some credit so uh I don't want to read

984
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,670
about this girl that got a ticket I'm

985
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:21,929
not gonna say her name she lit up her

986
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,510
Chilam on the outskirts of the rally

987
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:26,159
just before police officers on bicycles

988
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,900
rode by they handed her a hundred and

989
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,809
fifty dollar ticket for public marijuana

990
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:34,500
consumption but they said go into a

991
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:35,909
crowd where we can't pick you out so

992
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,139
they were trying to be cool about it the

993
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:38,699
shooters just right on the out spirits

994
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:41,460
portion they were like he done ass we

995
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:45,139
got to give you a ticket you know so

996
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,139
maybe that was not smart on her part

997
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:52,070
doesn't seem like there were many uh

998
00:40:49,650 --> 00:41:00,930
events because of cannabis this year I

999
00:40:52,070 --> 00:41:02,550
bet they were predicting a lot worse oh

1000
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:05,129
that's well with all the police they had

1001
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,330
set up dude like this is ridiculous you

1002
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:12,180
can see the pictures of it there are

1003
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:17,369
guard towers yeah mm-hmm that's no way

1004
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:19,139
to celebrate 4/20 this year's rally had

1005
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:20,819
fences around Civic Center designated

1006
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:22,679
entry points with pat downs and bag

1007
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,210
check street closures dozens of

1008
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,159
Booth's from hemp energy drinks to

1009
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:28,470
festival favorites like the turkey leg

1010
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:31,230
guy and two stages for musical

1011
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:33,119
performance after a shooting marred last

1012
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,710
year's rally armed security guards this

1013
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,239
year walked through the crowd at

1014
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,010
mid-afternoon the air even smelled

1015
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:41,339
slightly less perfumed with pop than

1016
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:43,140
last year's are the nears best mm-hmm

1017
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:46,500
that's kind of funny so they were

1018
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:48,480
smoking less down there is actually

1019
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,130
easier to smoke outside before it was

1020
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,920
legal a person said the police are

1021
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,360
watching much more now so maybe we kind

1022
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,460
of hosed ourselves by doing this you

1023
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,599
guys maybe and then we can do about it

1024
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:03,920
now but we gotta be careful gotta be

1025
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:06,239
responsible right all right so uh I

1026
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,550
think we should take a quick dab and

1027
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:14,369
then we should do the part of the show

1028
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:16,140
that we call give thanks really special

1029
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:17,639
all right guys we're gonna find a cool

1030
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:23,339

1031
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:25,829

00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:28,980
say if you guys have musical suggestions

00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:28,040

1079
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,630
special episode of our version of give

1080
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:30,920
thanks we've ever done we want to give

1081
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:33,349
thanks to the young lady by the name of

1082
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,030
Jenny Kush I've been looking for the

1083
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:37,400
right words to say about Jenny Kush and

1084
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:41,300
I honestly did not know Jenny a whole

1085
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:44,539
bunch but I do see the effect that she

1086
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,760
had on my community our community and I

1087
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:49,489
feel that she deserves to be awarded and

1088
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,800
honored and so I was at the Cannabis tub

1089
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:53,539
I know cannabis tub up above but I saw a

1090
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,470
magazine with miss Jenny Kernan on the

1091
00:45:53,539 --> 00:46:00,019
cover and the magazine is cm report and

1092
00:45:57,469 --> 00:46:02,359
it's October 13

1093
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:04,429
it's Volume one issue three it's a free

1094
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,630
magazine it's got a beautiful painting

1095
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,859
of Jenny on the cover she's got a red

1096
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,670
building green hair purple in the

1097
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,769
background

1098
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:12,750
and the author of this and him and I

1099
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:14,838
kind of we're in the same boat about

1100
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,280
with our level of how much we knew Jenny

1101
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:20,989
so I'm gonna read another person's

1102
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,400
article because it's perfect here we go

1103
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:25,500
Jennifer to let Mon said more commonly

1104
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,210
known as Jenny Kush and often self

1105
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,099
referred to as Ginny [ __ ] cush

1106
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:31,588
it's so awesome hi I'm Jenny [ __ ]

1107
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,660
cush anyway Jenny [ __ ] cush a mother

1108
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:35,099
an activist mmm and we'll make her a

1109
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:37,379
friend and a lover of many things

1110
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:40,588
ironically taken from us by the very

1111
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,550
things she fought so hard against I want

1112
00:46:40,588 --> 00:46:42,960
to make sure I'm recording this because

1113
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,230
we've had issues with the computer all

1114
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,400
right while traveling home from a

1115
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:49,019
concert Jenny and her life partner

1116
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,789
Jeremy were struck head-on by a drunk

1117
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:52,800
driver travelling the wrong way on the

1118
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:55,920
high occupancy vehicle lane early in the

1119
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,450
morning of August 31st Jimi hosted sex

1120
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,760
pot radio where they would discuss some

1121
00:46:57,449 --> 00:47:01,500
of our favorite things sex pop and

1122
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,190
all-around mental physical and spiritual

1123
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,530
well-being

1124
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:06,858
Jenny off the tinted local Jenny often

1125
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:09,329
attended local rallies and protests and

1126
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:13,469
with her background in Nursing Jenny was

1127
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:15,420
always ready to help someone in need and

1128
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:17,068
this isn't my article but I completely

1129
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,180
missus we're in the same boat here so

1130
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:19,798
says I only had the pleasure of

1131
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:21,509
interacting with Jenny a few on a few

1132
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:23,130
occasions so I feel somewhat under

1133
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,780
qualified to write this article although

1134
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:27,150
my personal experience with Jenny was

1135
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,410
limited by experience what those are

1136
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,750
life touch is plentiful

1137
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:33,449

1140
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:40,230

1141
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,789
have never before witnessed within hours

1142
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,980
of hearing the horrible news her friends

1143
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:45,690

community that did that well I can't say

1159
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,800
our community but that was mostly you

1160
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,150
know the cannabis community so that

1161
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,800
shows that we're not a bunch of wheat

1162
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:29,710
heads that we ignite for a cause and

1163
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,120
when we love somebody man we can show so

1164

1376
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,719
growing cannabis he says that we we talk

1377
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,099
over people's heads sometimes he said he

1378
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,920
has no idea what we're saying a lot of

1379
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:12,809

was provided the pollen and just hit it

1538
01:06:15,969 --> 01:06:25,389
with a plan I had and I wasn't expecting

1539
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:28,090
what came out from it it's really floral

1540
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:31,159

the the other female yeah I'll just kind

1552
01:07:08,449 --> 01:07:15,859
of keep that one female that uses male I

1553
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:21,050
know that's a good [ __ ] so yeah right on

1554
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:23,720
Clint's lost over here yeah what's so he

1555
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:25,700
made a scream he took a female plant and

1556
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:27,019
used I'm not even gonna ask about the

1557
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:28,339
method because I'm a breeder - I don't

1558
01:07:27,019 --> 01:07:29,719
know we don't talk about how we do our

1559
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:31,760
reversing and such that's kind of our

1560
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:34,579
own but you take a female plant you

1561
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,740
reverse it make it into a male by

1562
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:38,809
certain techniques and then it'll spit

1563
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:40,939
out pollen that only has female traits

1564
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:45,199
and so you'll make female seeds out of

1565
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:48,349
that elaborate on that a little more if

01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:39,800
and mk4 or m4k whichever one yeah good

1613
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:41,809
cats really good cats good family keep

1614
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:45,470
going sorry I totally interrupted um I

1615
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:48,560
took second behind uh my job

1616
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:52,369
conveniently so it was not too bad but

1617
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,630
um it was a talisman OG or I don't even

1618
01:09:52,369 --> 01:09:57,289
know if they're calling or no G but

1619
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:59,090
talisman um in my mix was actually three

1620
01:09:57,289 --> 01:10:01,130
different fee knows of the talisman

1621
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:04,159
altogether so I figured it'd give a

1622
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:05,300
better you know taste for what it was

1623
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:09,260
made of um

1624
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:11,480
I dubbed it chemtrails because it was

1625
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:16,220
made out of one of the parents of

1626
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:17,809
talisman is Kim dog og so it's very very

1627
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,570
keen me so that's why we named it the

1628
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:22,640
chemtrails sweet so some somebody hit me

1629
01:10:20,569 --> 01:10:25,279
up and said I like Kim but I don't like

1630
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,829
Kim trails and I was like well you'll

1631
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,479
like it anyway so it was cool dankness

1632
01:10:27,829 --> 01:10:33,350
has a strain called chemtrails so be

1633
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:34,549
careful yeah I wondered about that

1634
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:36,070
sometimes I'm gonna bust your balls a

1635
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:38,570
little bit and we're bro so it's cool

1636
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:40,880
when the hash makers make hash sometimes

1637
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:42,009
it's confusing to patients when you

1638
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,329
label it as Kim

1639
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:45,880
because now they think it's chemtrails

1640
01:10:43,329 --> 01:10:47,769
dabs yeah or if you made up a name I see

1641
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,810
I know one guy on the online on the damn

1642
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:51,010
Internet that makes up names oh he took

1643
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:53,380
off his headphones we're gonna fight

1644
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:56,230
no the headphones cut out so oh man I

1645
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:58,390
can tap them here but when people mix up

1646
01:10:56,229 --> 01:11:00,399
the the flavors it's confusing to the

1647
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:01,630
patient so just to bust your balls a

1648
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:02,889
little no worries let's cool the hose

1649
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,210
for a competition it wasn't for a

1650
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:05,619
dispensary or anything we can get your

1651
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:07,480
headphones gone bro yeah I was gonna hit

1652
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:09,849
a Kevin next so here I'll keep talking

1653
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:11,500
does it sound anything see I just got a

1654
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:13,030
TAC polygon again see it's right here

1655
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,439
right there how's that mmm that feels

1656
01:11:13,029 --> 01:11:15,789
good oh you like that but does it make

1657
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:18,699
the headphones work right there okay

1658
01:11:15,789 --> 01:11:19,630
yeah that's kind of gross yeah you

1659
01:11:18,699 --> 01:11:22,119
should have seen the look he gave me

1660
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:23,380
that's kind of gross are you doing over

1661

01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:46,630
gonna do a little bit of a review

1670
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:48,310
we gotta get if you're using a hive nail

1671
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:49,840
something I should tell you don't use

1672
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:52,300
titanium tools don't use metal tools

1673
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,850
don't use a paperclip coated a plastic

1674
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:56,409
like of our friends tried to do you

1675
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:57,730
listenin bro you've done a lot of

1676
01:11:56,409 --> 01:12:01,689
smarter [ __ ] than that in your life

1677
01:11:57,729 --> 01:12:03,399
let's not uh yeah don't don't use weird

1678
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:04,809
tools on the hive used some glass or

1679
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:13,289
some they need to make a nice ceramic

1680
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:15,250
diver they do okay all right fair enough

1681
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:19,300
so you're supposed to heat it in a

1682
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:20,500
circle right yep for how long I can

1683
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,520
count do you know do you have like a

1684
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,649
count on your head I always know how

1685
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,870
long I haven't counted I have not took

1686
01:12:23,649 --> 01:12:27,488
the time to count it's about 15 to 20

1687
01:12:25,869 --> 01:12:31,319
seconds if you have encountered how do

1688
01:12:27,488 --> 01:12:31,319
you know that how do I know what

1689
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:36,880
estimating time okay estimation what a

1690
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:38,880
ball busting on this show estimation

1691
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:41,010
time so heat in a circle

1692
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,010
[Music]

1693
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:44,010
five

1694
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:47,860
Tan

1695
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:53,390
fifteen I think that's good and I feel

1696
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:55,039
it now feel it okay don't touch it don't

1697
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:56,150
grab don't just grab it I think it needs

1698
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,769
a little more I know how to tell when

1699
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:59,899
it's hot enough it needs a little more

1700
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:01,700
high that's what I kind of feel warm by

1701
01:12:59,899 --> 01:13:03,049
your fingers about an inch above twenty

1702
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:05,149
to twenty five is where I think we need

1703
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:06,619
to go you don't want it to be hot but

1704
01:13:05,149 --> 01:13:09,319
you don't want it to take a second to

1705
01:13:06,619 --> 01:13:11,689
feel warm yeah do one of you hash guys

1706
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:12,889
want to explain about low temp dads and

1707
01:13:11,689 --> 01:13:14,419
all the people overheating their dads

1708
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:16,940
either one of you guys both you together

1709
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:20,270
Spence nada to you bro go alright I'll

1710
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:21,769
chime in thor's yeah the low temp jobs

1711
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:24,350
like really help conserve the

1712
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:27,590
cannabinoids and the terpenes throughout

1713
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:30,740
the hash when you do higher tabs you end

1714
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:33,489
up boiling away and it destroys some of

1715
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:35,569
that molecular structure if it's too hot

1716
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:38,840
but also you don't want to do them too

1717
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:40,399
cold either because sometimes you know

1718
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,289
you want to melt all the hash obviously

1719
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:46,819
you want to get everything consumed from

1720
01:13:42,289 --> 01:13:49,519
the dab and God forbid if there is

1721
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:51,369
residuals it does help burn off the

1722
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,810
residual so you don't consume those

1723
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:56,000
pentane burns at 600 zeros yeah you

1724
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:57,470
don't want it to be too cold so no I'm

1725
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,649
wrong with that help so I don't remember

1726
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:03,020
yeah 600 like 605 will burn off pentane

1727
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:05,119
and butane yeah a lot of people don't

1728
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:06,680
understand it but it's you know you

1729
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:09,199
don't want to be diving off of a

1730
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,860
scolding red nail that's not very good

1731
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,899
for your body

1732
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:14,269
Yeah right here I mean obviously you can

1733
01:14:11,899 --> 01:14:17,319
tell like when you're yakking up after a

1734
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:19,360
dive it's most likely from your dad's or

1735
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:21,460
a red-hot nail or you take too big of

1736
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:24,399
dads like I do or you do that I kind of

1737
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:25,569
do them too large so I like that that

1738
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:27,189
was nice and smooth honestly it wasn't

1739
01:14:25,569 --> 01:14:29,738
my first date off there but it's my

1740
01:14:27,189 --> 01:14:31,029
first one on the show it's smooth it

1741
01:14:29,738 --> 01:14:33,339
tastes good I overheated it just to

1742
01:14:31,029 --> 01:14:35,319
touch but it tastes good it's nice and

1743
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,969
smooth what I liked is somebody told me

1744
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:38,289
that you could take several dabs off of

1745
01:14:36,969 --> 01:14:40,000
it if you kind of overheat it the first

1746
01:14:38,289 --> 01:14:43,300
yeah holds temperature really well if

1747
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,738
you're I even say this if you're in the

1748
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,969
car and dabbing and all three of you in

1749
01:14:44,738 --> 01:14:47,198
the car need to get a DAB and you don't

1750
01:14:45,969 --> 01:14:51,520
wanna be with the torch in the car a lot

1751
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:53,138
and he can pull two or three dabs I'm

1752
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,630
not sure that if I just promoted dabbing

1753
01:14:53,139 --> 01:14:56,980
in the car but people do a guy in Denver

1754
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:58,480
a couple weeks ago dabbing in the car

1755
01:14:56,979 --> 01:14:59,828
he's scared the [ __ ] out of me I thought

1756
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:02,078
he was gonna drive into some [ __ ] he

1757
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:03,399
doesn't he was not pro like us oh I

1758
01:15:02,078 --> 01:15:06,639
thought you were talking about a parked

1759
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:13,658
car yeah

1760
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:15,550
dab in the car if you're parked go for

1761
01:15:13,658 --> 01:15:17,529
it [ __ ] it so if I'm driving keV should

1762
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:19,210
take dad no problem he should take more

1763
01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:21,639
dabs you should take one for me right

1764
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:24,730
yeah exactly for your homies mm have

1765
01:15:21,639 --> 01:15:27,159
slowed your face what do you think of

1766
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:30,549
that nail dress yeah it's really smooth

1767
01:15:27,158 --> 01:15:32,078
cool cool it scares me though I've seen

1768
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:35,320
a couple of minutes yeah go ahead you're

1769
01:15:32,078 --> 01:15:38,889
gonna I'm a big guy a fragile thing

1770
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:41,559
scare me means well yeah that's partly

1771
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:43,449
why I'm afraid of it until we break it I

1772
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:45,250
approve that's a cool thing I'll try my

1773
01:15:43,448 --> 01:15:47,919
best not to break your nail bro it's

1774
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:49,719
ceramic and in my world we're heating it

1775
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,750
and cooling it I just make sense to me

1776
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:55,328
that it's gonna bust I've seen one my

1777
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:57,399
friend's house and they broke it pretty

1778
01:15:55,328 --> 01:15:59,710
quickly now the nail is the the piece

1779
01:15:57,399 --> 01:16:02,408
that's that's connected to the ball yeah

1780
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:04,448
Clinton noob yeah yeah I'm gonna ask the

1781
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:05,738
questions that some people I know it's

1782
01:16:04,448 --> 01:16:07,689
awesome I like it we need you here for

1783
01:16:05,738 --> 01:16:09,609
more episodes yes I'm in just like that

1784
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:11,609
exactly what I need you for I believe

1785
01:16:09,609 --> 01:16:14,139
that would be referred to as the rig's

1786
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:16,819
sorry the thing that looks like a bong

1787
01:16:14,139 --> 01:16:19,730
called the rig there is the

1788
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:21,769
the heated parts it's a baby bonk it's

1789
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:23,929
the heated the part that you're heating

1790
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:27,470
up is called a Mickey yeah from what

1791
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:31,100
I've gathered so far yes ceramic or

1792
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:32,990
titanium or quartz or glass if they're

1793
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:36,110
really cheap [ __ ] I've seen I've seen

1794
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:41,149
Jeff Davin off of titanium as well as

1795
01:16:36,109 --> 01:16:44,809
now I've seen the ceramic now between

1796
01:16:41,149 --> 01:16:46,279
those two what do you guys prefer is

1797
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:49,640
there a preference in between those two

1798
01:16:46,279 --> 01:16:51,409
or is it still nude is a ceramic still

1799
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,850
new and you don't know yet um I haven't

1800
01:16:51,409 --> 01:16:54,680
spent enough time with the ceramic to

1801
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:56,510
see how long it'll last the titanium

1802
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,760
does burn out from heating and cooling

1803
01:16:56,510 --> 01:17:00,739
and absorbing all that Earl and all that

1804
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,239
it does kind of burn out I haven't had

1805
01:17:00,739 --> 01:17:06,260
this rat McClung enough haven't seen one

1806
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:07,909
around I I'm not the ceramic doesn't

1807
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,560
come in a domed version and in my

1808
01:17:07,909 --> 01:17:11,869
backpack when I'm cruising I need a dome

1809
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,460
because I get [ __ ] stuck to my domeless

1810
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:15,349
nail the next time I go to use it it

1811
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:17,199
tastes like [ __ ] it's funky so I need a

1812
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:19,730
dome going like with the dome here oh

1813
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:22,550
it's almost a cap that goes over your

1814
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:24,349
nail and these are domeless there's a

1815
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,489
hole right down the center of it so you

1816
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,870
don't need the dome so it's a little

1817
01:17:25,489 --> 01:17:28,579
more convenient for here at the table

1818
01:17:26,869 --> 01:17:32,779
but in my backpack I need this style

1819
01:17:28,579 --> 01:17:34,309
seems like go for it I just did I didn't

1820
01:17:32,779 --> 01:17:36,109
even heat it with the torch it was still

1821
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:37,520
hot enough for me to do my dab it was

1822
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:39,139
like the perfect temperature actually

1823
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,450
that's kind of a throw dab that's gonna

1824
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:44,869
need yeah this actually also represents

1825
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:46,279
progression and nails - yeah starting

1826
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:48,739
with the domed ones and then the dome

1827
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:51,229
lists no the ceramics is so the domed

1828
01:17:48,739 --> 01:17:53,329
ones were the first ones yeah right yeah

1829
01:17:51,229 --> 01:17:55,819
actually what was kind of first was the

1830
01:17:53,329 --> 01:17:57,470
swingarm skillet yeah they made a piece

1831
01:17:55,819 --> 01:17:59,029
that came out of here and it hung upside

1832
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:00,170
down and they wrapped like a piece of

1833
01:17:59,029 --> 01:18:02,420
wire around it and hung a little

1834
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:03,949
titanium plate underneath there okay and

1835
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,810
you drop your dab on the plate and it

1836
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:12,199
would go when you inhale it go up and

1837
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:14,210
those things hit like so we're very

1838
01:18:12,199 --> 01:18:16,729
happy that we moved away from that yes

1839
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:18,710
yes shout out the task for improving and

1840
01:18:16,729 --> 01:18:21,379
innovating the nails every day for sure

1841
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:25,500
oh yeah I had a question on the gray

1842
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:27,900
posy or oh gee sorry great bounce

1843
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,909
nobody idea on the gray poaching is

1844
01:18:27,899 --> 01:18:31,379
that's something that that somebody can

1845
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:33,119
pick up is there a place they can pick

1846
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:35,369
that up or is that just your personal

1847
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:36,809
stuff that's my personal okay and then

1848
01:18:35,369 --> 01:18:38,729
on the shatter we were talking about

1849
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:40,740
earlier I already forgot the name of it

1850
01:18:38,729 --> 01:18:42,029
is that something that do they sell that

1851
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:53,429
kind of stuff in dispensaries and

1852
01:18:42,029 --> 01:18:55,920
recreational places we like I work for a

1853
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:58,800
shop so like the demand for it is so

1854
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,569
high that it's never around okay

1855
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,420
I mean it is but once it's there it's

1856
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:05,039
going I guess I kind of half-assed

1857
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:11,520
trying to plug your stuff so people can

1858
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:13,050
buy it it's your stuff then yeah yeah a

1859
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,940
lot of dads are hard to come by where

1860
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:16,500
those of us that are blessed enough to

1861
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:19,829
have a nice little slab like this we

1862
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:21,539
kind of hoard it yeah I take my material

1863
01:19:19,829 --> 01:19:23,010
from Lima seed maker I'm a seed breeder

1864
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:24,720
and I have my own little caregiver girl

1865
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:26,340
and I take my leftover material the trim

1866
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,770
and whatnot and let these two guys blast

1867
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:30,300
it for me and that's how they make a lot

1868
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:31,320
of their cut for their personal hash I

1869
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,480
don't want to get into their business

1870
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:35,429
but then I get my cut back and I barely

1871
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:37,289
get enough I dab a lot yeah and I've got

1872
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:40,829
patients that I have to distribute it to

1873
01:19:37,289 --> 01:19:43,319
share it with medically so it disappears

1874
01:19:40,829 --> 01:19:46,529
very quickly all right yes see you know

1875
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:49,019
in the room not like I'm sitting there

1876
01:19:46,529 --> 01:19:50,429
going oh cuz I've only hung out with you

1877
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:52,200
when somebody's dabbing it's only been

1878
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:54,270
you and I always see like there's a good

1879
01:19:52,199 --> 01:20:01,710
amount of I guess chatter yeah so we're

1880
01:19:54,270 --> 01:20:03,360
gonna call yeah yeah wax wax is the same

1881
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:05,250
you take this probably for doing it

1882
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:07,769
right you take this product and at the

1883
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:09,630
end you heat it again and apply like a

1884
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:11,070
whipping motion to it to put air into it

1885
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:13,590
and it just fluff it up a little bit

1886
01:20:11,069 --> 01:20:15,149
okay and some people skip a couple of

1887
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:16,619
steps and they do that too early and

1888
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:18,299
that [ __ ] everything up if you do it

1889
01:20:16,619 --> 01:20:20,369
right and do it at the end wax can be

1890
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,690
great now what I like about it this we

1891
01:20:20,369 --> 01:20:22,979
have to use the little dab tools it's

1892
01:20:21,689 --> 01:20:25,409
kind of shatter it's hard to work with

1893
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:27,119
wax you can pick it up and play with it

1894
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:29,010
make a little ball and a slam dunk it

1895
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,229
without a dabber okay a little easier to

1896
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:32,770
work with and it hits harder yeah some

1897
01:20:31,229 --> 01:20:34,599
of the best-tasting

1898
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:37,510
have ever smokes has been worse okay

1899
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:39,670
sure yeah for sure some tangi wax as

1900
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:41,020
long as your day the guy down there at

1901
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:45,640
the end of the table actually has made

1902
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:47,410
the best tasting wax oh sure I think it

1903
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,119
was something you grew it a couple years

1904
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:51,609
ago that was actually if you you know a

1905
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:56,649
while ago too so it's probably the dog

1906
01:20:51,609 --> 01:21:04,960
or the I want to say it was the lemon

1907
01:20:56,649 --> 01:21:08,549
skunk wax yeah cool thank you I think

1908
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,550
that lemon Geoffrey is some of the best

1909
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:12,579
a lot of people always ask what's your

1910
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:14,140
best for dabs if you're making shatter

1911
01:21:12,579 --> 01:21:15,640
order up a pack of lemon Geoffrey but

1912
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,020
guess what everything sold out for a

1913
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,880
minute

1914
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:20,790
they're coming to I'm working on it it

1915
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:23,079
takes a long time to breed some seeds

1916
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:26,019
see that you're sold out I think you can

1917
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:28,000
refill it tomorrow or like it takes a

1918
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:30,960
minute bro how long does it take to

1919
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:40,750
breed seats and what exactly is that oh

1920
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:41,949
wow the quick part is you got to get

1921
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:43,659
plants that you have to make selections

1922
01:21:41,949 --> 01:21:45,519
you have to have a male and no which

1923
01:21:43,659 --> 01:21:47,769
females you want to breed with you have

1924
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,150
to get them large enough to put into the

1925
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:51,310
flower stage which will take you two or

1926
01:21:49,149 --> 01:21:53,259
three months okay the way that I like to

1927
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:55,270
grow usually about two months three if

1928
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:57,190
you're just from clone then you got to

1929
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:59,050
get those flowering you have to one

1930
01:21:57,189 --> 01:22:01,479
needs a head start on the other will not

1931
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:02,920
get specific in two times so you're

1932
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:06,069
looking about twelve weeks of flowering

1933
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:07,690
time after the two months so you're

1934
01:22:06,069 --> 01:22:09,729
looking like five or six months just to

1935
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:11,109
produce the seeds and then you need to

1936
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:12,729
test them like if I were gonna put him

1937
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:14,529
out I would give them to all these guys

1938
01:22:12,729 --> 01:22:15,969
to grow to see what they do before I

1939
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:18,250
would even consider putting them out to

1940
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:19,869
anybody of course yeah yeah and then if

1941
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:21,340
I find that they're kind of [ __ ] up

1942
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:22,840
but they're close I'll find one that's

1943
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:26,920
really close to what I'm looking for

1944
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:28,720
because it'll be variations that's there

1945
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:30,430
be variations in phenotype it's like if

1946
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,140
like your brothers and sisters all don't

1947
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:33,159
look the same well stations yeah yeah

1948
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:34,810
yeah I'd find the brother and sister

1949
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:36,618
that looks just perfect that I want to

1950
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:38,209
make babies with

1951
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:41,029
to breed it back with the daddy again

1952
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:43,788
okay and so that'll bring the traits

1953
01:22:41,029 --> 01:22:46,158
that I want maybe or or sometimes

1954
01:22:43,788 --> 01:22:47,359
crosses sometimes when you [ __ ]

1955
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:48,558
everything up huh

1956
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:50,148
but if you do it right if you fly if you

1957
01:22:48,559 --> 01:22:51,679
got that magic cut it's all genetic

1958
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:53,539
combinations if they match up right

1959
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,550
you'll come out with by the third or

1960
01:22:53,538 --> 01:22:57,559
fourth generation every seed will be

1961
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:59,659
very similar to each other by the time

1962
01:22:57,559 --> 01:23:02,389
they're done okay yeah so breeding could

1963
01:22:59,658 --> 01:23:04,759
take if you're making F ones from fans

1964
01:23:02,389 --> 01:23:07,010
and you're cool with that five months

1965
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,139
six months after making F ones that are

1966
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:11,719
rags five or six months but if you want

1967
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:13,578
to make f2s which are going back and re

1968
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:15,439
breeding or make F threes

1969
01:23:13,578 --> 01:23:17,688
you're looking at years and years I

1970
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:21,559
thought I was doing I've been that

1971
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:23,539
crossing for four or five years now so

1972
01:23:21,559 --> 01:23:26,869
Wow and I'm only on the third leg of the

1973
01:23:23,538 --> 01:23:29,300
back cross so goodness yeah so there's

1974
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:32,628
there's there's a lot more to you know

1975
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:34,279
growing a weed then then many people

1976
01:23:32,628 --> 01:23:36,800
give you guys credit for you know

1977
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:38,389
because I look at it I'm like alright

1978
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,458
well there's plants in the ground or

1979
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:42,260
plants and pots and they're growing them

1980
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:44,538
and then harvest them and I don't look

1981
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:47,059
at you know all the back work that goes

1982
01:23:44,538 --> 01:23:48,918
into that and I know that like like the

1983
01:23:47,059 --> 01:23:51,559
last time I smoked weed was ten years

1984
01:23:48,918 --> 01:23:53,479
ago and so of course things are gonna

1985
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:56,510
get better but I I did see that huge

1986
01:23:53,479 --> 01:23:57,649
progression when when Medical started

1987
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:59,090
being okay oh yeah

1988
01:23:57,649 --> 01:24:00,499
that's yeah they're really what is what

1989
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:03,860
helped us be able to breed we could set

1990
01:24:00,498 --> 01:24:05,300
up not we but they could set up thousand

1991
01:24:03,859 --> 01:24:07,158
light wire houses and just throw out as

1992
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:08,628
many seeds as they could and grow all of

1993
01:24:07,158 --> 01:24:10,848
them and then you find that magic keeper

1994
01:24:08,628 --> 01:24:12,800
and then yeah if you've got that if you

1995
01:24:10,849 --> 01:24:14,269
can grow in that many numbers that's why

1996
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,189
Holland is big haulin lets you kind of

1997
01:24:14,269 --> 01:24:19,189
get away with a lot of playa numbers you

1998
01:24:16,189 --> 01:24:22,369
shout out to Holland the best comes from

1999
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:25,610
Northern California or came in Colorado

2000
01:24:22,368 --> 01:24:28,158
Colorado Colorado breeders are killing

2001
01:24:25,609 --> 01:24:29,958
it not even from here but we have a lot

2002
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:32,359
of we have a lot of advantages were the

2003
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:33,918
same altitude and climate and conditions

2004
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:35,839
as Afghanistan which is where a lot of

2005
01:24:33,918 --> 01:24:38,898
our favorite genetics are from oh it's

2006
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:42,078
really advantageous yeah 300 days of

2007
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:43,820
sunlight a year yeah that's you don't

2008
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:46,840
get that in a lot of places yeah besides

2009
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:50,219
like Iraq I grew up all right

2010
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:53,289
do you yeah so the plants get huge here

2011
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:55,650
gigantic yields trunks this big around

2012
01:24:53,289 --> 01:24:59,319
they for the listener that was like a

2013
01:24:55,649 --> 01:25:01,779
twelve inch circumference yeah easily

2014
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:04,799
one of those Gatorade bottles or yeah

2015
01:25:01,779 --> 01:25:07,869
gonna arm two water bottles

2016
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:10,420
I've seen I've seen branches that grow

2017
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:12,699
man can actually stand on to like reach

2018
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:14,199
the top of their plan yeah I've seen you

2019
01:25:12,699 --> 01:25:18,039
guys have to get ladders to trim the top

2020
01:25:14,199 --> 01:25:19,750
yeah there's I know spots where I've

2021
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:22,420
been on three hundred and fifty plant

2022
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:24,189
outdoor farms where the four of us grown

2023
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:25,420
men sitting here sorry Kevin Dineen to

2024
01:25:24,189 --> 01:25:26,799
disclude you from the grown men but it

2025
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,649
wouldn't take you also it just needs us

2026
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,180
for the four of us could reach around

2027
01:25:28,649 --> 01:25:32,859
these plants and barely touch hands but

2028
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:35,440
the four of us would take to get around

2029
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:36,969
these plants Wow yeah we're looking five

2030
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:38,500
pounds on some of those not on Jesse's

2031
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:40,480
but these are like in a mountain town

2032
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,420
where nobody you'll find him five pounds

2033
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:45,009
out of one plant five pounds out of one

2034
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:46,690
and then rocking probably 300 of a month

2035
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,949
some of these plantations but that's I

2036
01:25:46,689 --> 01:25:50,259
mean there's putting a lot of money into

2037
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:51,729
like the like you were saying yeah

2038
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:53,230
there's there's a crew like us weren't

2039
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:54,849
like us boys there's a crew of us

2040
01:25:53,229 --> 01:25:56,619
working there all day long from morning

2041
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:59,350
to night all day and then at night they

2042
01:25:56,619 --> 01:26:02,019
just hang out like they pass out yes

2043
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:03,970
it's hard manual labor it is people

2044
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:05,620
don't give us credit for yeah for being

2045
01:26:03,970 --> 01:26:07,329
uh I've got an indoor facility and

2046
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:08,739
you've got trash to deal with like the

2047
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:10,059
city doesn't want your weed trash you

2048
01:26:08,739 --> 01:26:11,800
gotta know that you got to get that to

2049
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:16,180
the dump and the dump doesn't want it

2050
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:17,529
either well yeah but that's a fire

2051
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:21,640
ordinance you know I don't want to come

2052
01:26:17,529 --> 01:26:22,329
into your grow facility it smells it

2053
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,280
stinks

2054
01:26:22,329 --> 01:26:25,539
it smells got to deal with you got water

2055
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:25,869
to deal with there's a lot to think

2056
01:26:25,539 --> 01:26:28,539
about

2057
01:26:25,869 --> 01:26:32,019
it's yeah electricity the fire hazards

2058
01:26:28,539 --> 01:26:33,789
licensing there's a lot too yeah see and

2059
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:36,430
that's something I think everybody got

2060
01:26:33,789 --> 01:26:38,229
mad because like the dispensaries were

2061
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:39,550
oh it's gonna be so expensive I can get

2062
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:41,979
it from this guy and it's like well yeah

2063
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:44,350
but look how professional they are being

2064
01:26:41,979 --> 01:26:45,759
with these in these dispensaries yeah

2065
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:47,680
they have to go through such regulations

2066
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,579
right and the weed there mostly is

2067
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:53,140
usually pretty clean usually they're

2068
01:26:51,579 --> 01:26:54,819
going through a lot of regulation now so

2069
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,289
the weeds tested they're all going

2070
01:26:54,819 --> 01:26:58,359
through steep hill Halen labs or a

2071
01:26:56,289 --> 01:26:59,409
similar laboratory

2072
01:26:58,359 --> 01:27:02,429
and they're getting all their stuff

2073
01:26:59,409 --> 01:27:04,659
tested for mold parasites pesticides

2074
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:06,340
little bugs so if there's spider mites

2075
01:27:04,659 --> 01:27:08,380
or fungus gnats or white flies in your

2076
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:10,420
weed they're gonna find it they're able

2077
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:13,989
to test Addison said that they can test

2078
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:15,940
for things like flora mite and has a max

2079
01:27:13,989 --> 01:27:17,319
and as oh my in your plants in Eagle 20

2080
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:22,589
in your bud

2081
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:22,590
if you use that [ __ ] in the cloner yeah

2082
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:28,420
yeah that's one of those is a mite aside

2083
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:30,190
one of them is actually a fungicide and

2084
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:32,109
the other one is just like an all-around

2085
01:27:30,189 --> 01:27:33,789
bug treatment but what that means is in

2086
01:27:32,109 --> 01:27:35,139
the cloner is basically the start of

2087
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:36,519
life you cut a plant and it's got a

2088
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:39,550
clone to make roots and then you got a

2089
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:41,740
veget most people go 3 or 4 weeks I go

2090
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:44,680
30 to 45 days I like them a little

2091
01:27:41,739 --> 01:27:45,729
bigger and then you flower for usually 9

2092
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,680
weeks is average

2093
01:27:45,729 --> 01:27:49,659
so from these little tiny babies all the

2094
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:53,260
way to they grow and you flower it you

2095
01:27:49,659 --> 01:27:55,090
dry it you trim it out this lab can find

2096
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:56,560
pesticides in there they can be like oh

2097
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:57,100
yeah use this [ __ ] here it is we found

2098
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,780
it in there

2099
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:01,960
oh you dry it out of these like this

2100
01:27:58,779 --> 01:28:05,920
kind of but these are like neurotoxins

2101
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:07,149
and proven carcinogenic sand now you

2102
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,680
don't want a dad nervous because where

2103
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:10,750
most of us are dabbers they're they're

2104
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:14,579
meant for ornamental flowers that aren't

2105
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:21,390
going to be consumed okay yeah but

2106
01:28:14,579 --> 01:28:24,819
doesn't care medical caregivers we don't

2107
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:26,560
like his pops is quite sick he's got a

2108
01:28:24,819 --> 01:28:29,229
condition that if we gave him some

2109
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,940
cannabis that had neurotoxins in it it's

2110
01:28:29,229 --> 01:28:32,349
only gonna make him worse we're trying

2111
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:34,149
to heal him you know so that's the kind

2112
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:37,090
of stuff that we all have to be aware of

2113
01:28:34,149 --> 01:28:38,799
and we have to be conscious of and like

2114
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:40,420
that's our goal that's what separates

2115
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,190
the medical growers and the real growers

2116
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:44,170
from just the guys out there trying to

2117
01:28:42,189 --> 01:28:46,119
make a buck I'd rather cut down a moldy

2118
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:48,010
plant throw it away and sell it to one

2119
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:49,479
of my own most of my patients honestly

2120
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:50,590
are older cats and I don't want to see

2121
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:53,019
them I don't want to feel like I just

2122
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:54,310
killed them I don't want that I do this

2123
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:56,980
to feel better it feels good to watch

2124
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:58,660
people his old man came over one time

2125
01:28:56,979 --> 01:29:00,989
felt like he walks with a cane

2126
01:28:58,659 --> 01:29:03,309
yeah hunched over walks with a cane

2127
01:29:00,989 --> 01:29:05,079
smoked the perfect strain with him that

2128
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:06,820
dude stood up and walked up the stairs

2129
01:29:05,079 --> 01:29:09,010
and turned around and said hey we bring

2130
01:29:06,819 --> 01:29:10,090
me my cane I forgot it nice yeah that's

2131
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:11,650
the kind of [ __ ] that makes you feel

2132
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:14,469
like Jesse smiling over there

2133
01:29:11,649 --> 01:29:14,829
is not in his head that's like yeah it's

2134
01:29:14,469 --> 01:29:16,750
awesome

2135
01:29:14,829 --> 01:29:19,000
oh yeah that's that's some weed that

2136
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:20,710
people hate I drew that and it made this

2137
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,060
guy stand up and he forgot her know if

2138
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:23,529
he forgot that he heard or if the pain

2139
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:25,270
went away it doesn't matter the

2140
01:29:23,529 --> 01:29:27,340
interaction the smoke session and the

2141
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:29,170
cannabis healed him long enough for him

2142
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:33,310
to forget his cane and walk up some

2143
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:37,539
stairs so that's that's where is even

2144
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:39,150
going I guess no topic but as the at the

2145
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:46,420
bud Bowl this weekend one of the judges

2146
01:29:39,149 --> 01:29:49,539
did it uh don't worry Oh judges that

2147
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:51,520
smoked the grape OG was epileptic and

2148
01:29:49,539 --> 01:29:53,439
she told me she didn't have any seizures

2149
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:56,380
for three days why she was smokin that

2150
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:58,658
oh and I mean that's awesome

2151
01:29:56,380 --> 01:30:01,239
she had already smoked pot and you know

2152
01:29:58,658 --> 01:30:03,879
had good results from it but it still

2153
01:30:01,238 --> 01:30:06,129
had the occasional seizure but with the

2154
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:09,069
grape OG she I guess three days with

2155
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:11,500
that one so now is that a like a THC

2156
01:30:09,069 --> 01:30:12,849
content or a CBD content hasn't been

2157
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:14,619
tested it's the perfect combination

2158
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:16,539
whatever it is I don't think it's one

2159
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:18,729
I'm not a scientist but as my experience

2160
01:30:16,539 --> 01:30:20,408
with the plant and administering plants

2161
01:30:18,729 --> 01:30:23,339
and strains do people think it's a

2162
01:30:20,408 --> 01:30:25,509
combination of terpenoids and THC CBD

2163
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:27,310
all of the different cannabinoids I

2164
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:29,579
think it's a combination perfectly

2165
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:32,170
matching her condition in her body

2166
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:33,550
profile there may be another person

2167
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:35,619
sitting right next to her that has the

2168
01:30:33,550 --> 01:30:37,659
same condition that it may not help yeah

2169
01:30:35,619 --> 01:30:39,698
exactly but I may have a plant in my

2170
01:30:37,658 --> 01:30:41,649
arsenal that may be perfect for that

2171
01:30:39,698 --> 01:30:44,139
person well there's thousands of strains

2172
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:46,569
now yeah yeah and there's millions

2173
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:48,010
because Jesse's appalled and chucker

2174
01:30:46,569 --> 01:30:49,359
Spence is on his way to be an apology

2175
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:51,369
I'm a pollen chucker

2176
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:52,839
by the time calf gets good at drawing

2177
01:30:51,369 --> 01:30:54,969
weed he'll fall in chucker because he's

2178
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:56,350
watching all of us yeah it only takes a

2179
01:30:54,969 --> 01:30:57,880
little once if you're reaching for

2180
01:30:56,350 --> 01:31:00,190
quality you want a pollen jock it's the

2181
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:03,880
way that the progression goes I had to

2182
01:31:00,189 --> 01:31:05,259
explain to a customer one time he he

2183
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,880
actually was like I don't see why

2184
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:08,560
there's all these different strains they

2185
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,800
can't be different and I had to explain

2186
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:14,230
him like actually they are like we found

2187
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:16,090
over 200 different molecules that are in

2188
01:31:14,229 --> 01:31:21,000
different levels in every single plant

2189
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:24,930
so you can teach us about genome mapping

2190
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,100
I can't wait I'll call him and see what

2191
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:26,880
he knows maybe he can put us in touch

2192
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,410
with the right people

2193
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,329
shadow absent amorous steve hill labs

2194
01:31:28,409 --> 01:31:33,239
yeah something else i just like to

2195
01:31:30,329 --> 01:31:35,840
mention kinda on the subject a CBD only

2196
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:39,479
legislation that is happening estates

2197
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:43,170
that like maybe just a strain named

2198
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:47,099
after a book they only want to grow that

2199
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:48,869
well that's [ __ ] because because of

2200
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:52,890
what we were just talking about yeah

2201
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:55,229
it's the full profile not just CBD some

2202
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:57,539
conditions do require a higher level of

2203
01:31:55,229 --> 01:32:00,000
certain things than than other

2204
01:31:57,539 --> 01:32:01,619
conditions yeah you need to find the

2205
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,079
right one that has the right levels of

2206
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:05,880
the right molecules for you you know one

2207
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:07,319
thing that one thing that somebody

2208
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:09,989
discovered i did this was not my

2209
01:32:07,319 --> 01:32:11,489
discovery I think it was Mitch to know

2210
01:32:09,989 --> 01:32:13,170
so they made this realization plants

2211
01:32:11,489 --> 01:32:14,939
that are high in CBD and low and THC

2212
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:17,369
qualifies him and it's legal to grow

2213
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:18,809
hemp all the [ __ ] over mm-hm so grow

2214
01:32:17,369 --> 01:32:21,689
that [ __ ] grow a large fields of CBD

2215
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:26,010
plants if that's you're sick yeah and

2216
01:32:21,689 --> 01:32:27,299
then make RSO out of it so actually

2217
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:28,800
we're not supposed to call it artists Oh

2218
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:30,210
Rick I was referring to Rick Simpson oil

2219
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,619
but we're not gonna call it Rick Simpson

2220
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:33,300
oil anymore because there's some

2221
01:32:31,619 --> 01:32:35,369
controversy with that people claim that

2222
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,810
he stole the idea and there's a lot of

2223
01:32:35,369 --> 01:32:38,069
weird stuff being said in the cannabis

2224
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:41,400
community and I don't want any part of

2225
01:32:38,069 --> 01:32:42,809
the backlash so it's full cannabis plant

2226
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:44,189
extract essentially you take a whole

2227
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:45,840
plant and I don't know how to do it I'm

2228
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:47,909
kind of ignorant to it that's not my I'm

2229
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,110
not an extract guy I'm a grower you take

2230
01:32:47,909 --> 01:32:50,489
the whole plant and you take a whole

2231
01:32:49,109 --> 01:32:53,939
bunch of it and you make a little bit of

2232
01:32:50,489 --> 01:32:56,340
it looks like tar and it's edible or you

2233
01:32:53,939 --> 01:32:58,109
can rub it on and it's uh it's basically

2234
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:00,270
all the cannabinoids and all the good

2235
01:32:58,109 --> 01:33:02,189
parts squished into a little tiny vial

2236
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:04,860
and you take just a pea-sized bite of it

2237
01:33:02,189 --> 01:33:08,579
and it's been known to I can't see cure

2238
01:33:04,859 --> 01:33:09,960
cancer but stop cancer and it Tommy

2239
01:33:08,579 --> 01:33:12,510
Chong claims if that's what got rid of

2240
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:16,500
his prostate cancer Wow yeah real life

2241
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:18,420
snake oil yeah but the real [ __ ] yeah

2242
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:21,090
yes so he calls it snake oil is like oh

2243
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:22,409
so it's fake but it's it's miracle [ __ ]

2244
01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:24,090
but no none of the medical

2245
01:33:22,409 --> 01:33:25,739
establishments want to recognize that

2246
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:27,180
it's actually your curing and helping

2247
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:28,769
well of course not because if it's

2248
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:30,720
curing things and they have no job

2249
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:32,130
exactly exactly but they're a little

2250
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:33,990
girls not having seizures and Tommy

don't hurt yourself it looks [ __ ]

2270
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:17,480
scary dude it looks scarier than making

2271
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:17,480
BHO to me one of those ingredients to

2272
01:34:18,949 --> 01:34:23,489
our s oh yeah it's a little tiny bit of

2273

it it's supposed to get rid of cancer

2274
01:34:23,489 --> 01:34:27,539

2287
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:55,920
guys headed 20 if I can find it yeah

2288
01:34:51,779 --> 01:34:59,819
cool I got a very basic question good

2289
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:01,710
like indigo versus sativa anybody wanna

2290
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:05,039
laugh um a Mike Adams cool and that one

2291
01:35:01,710 --> 01:35:07,319
too yeah he meant the first one yeah he

2292
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:12,899
wants to know about what's what's blue

2293
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:15,869
versus sativa indica is more of a strain

2294
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:17,579
from Iraq Afghanistan rocky mountainous

2295
01:35:15,869 --> 01:35:19,470
regions that is more that make you

2296
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:21,119
lazier or couch locky

2297
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:25,140
that's the strains where you will find

2298
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:27,059
the CBD stuff so sativa is more of a

2299
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:28,530
tropical region kind of stuff it'll grow

2300
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:30,810
so the indicas grow short and bushy

2301
01:35:28,529 --> 01:35:32,399
gonna have bigger fatter leaves they

2302
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:34,050
finish earlier because where they're

2303
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:35,879
from the cult comes and they got to be

2304
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:38,279
done sooner and they don't get as tall

2305
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:39,850
because they're in Rocky your area so

2306
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:41,500
the land

2307
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:43,420
the roots actually branch out further

2308
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:44,859
this way instead of going down yeah

2309
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:46,510
because they're in rocky regions they

2310
01:35:44,859 --> 01:35:48,099
can't dig so they stay it may get bushy

2311
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:50,050
because they can dig up bigger feet so

2312
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:51,460
they can balance out wider sativas on

2313
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:52,539
the other hand err from tropical area so

2314
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:54,310
they get real tall and they kind of get

2315
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:55,930
Airy so they don't get moldy because

2316
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:57,850
there's humidity there so they've got to

2317
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:58,990
get some like this is the grossest

2318
01:35:57,850 --> 01:36:01,030
[ __ ] description you know and it's

2319
01:35:58,989 --> 01:36:04,389
hot here ball swing yeah sativas kind of

2320
01:36:01,029 --> 01:36:06,219
spread out a little a little bit trying

2321
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:07,180
to get some space yeah so the sativa is

2322
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:08,320
kind of do that and if you guys are

2323
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:09,610
getting larvae buds in your grow room

2324
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:11,590
just cuz you're overheating and that's

2325
01:36:09,609 --> 01:36:12,909
the exact reason why if you're not

2326
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:14,260
growing a good sativa in your shits air

2327
01:36:12,909 --> 01:36:16,569
it out it's cuz it's too hot try to get

2328
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:18,940
some space make sure yeah

2329
01:36:16,569 --> 01:36:20,559
so a sativas are more from like what a

2330
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:22,479
vietnam like a lot of stuff is from

2331
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,370
vietnam like like asian countries and

2332
01:36:22,479 --> 01:36:29,679
stuff like that the way laughing

2333
01:36:24,369 --> 01:36:31,090
spinster now somebody hey Shona Fung

2338
01:36:37,779 --> 01:36:41,679
picture of it right now

2339
01:36:38,649 --> 01:36:44,769
Instagram and I'll tag Jeff in it so we

2340
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:46,300
can check it out too but uh so that I

2341
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:48,070
can check it out I've never seen it

2342
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,779
before yeah what's it look like pretty

2343
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:51,880
cool I was saying see your listeners can

2344
01:36:49,779 --> 01:36:53,409
check it out indicas we'll finish

2345
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:56,289
earlier and because I've seen some

2346
01:36:53,409 --> 01:36:58,000
they've finished in 55 56 days I like to

2347
01:36:56,289 --> 01:37:00,609
let most plants go at least 60 I think

2348
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,829
they're done then but uh indicas will be

2349
01:37:00,609 --> 01:37:05,500
done around 9 weeks the longest I've got

2350
01:37:02,829 --> 01:37:07,390
sativas that take 77 days which is 11

2351
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:09,850
weeks in flower that's just the the

2352
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:12,130
flowering cycle and they'll grow tall

2353
01:37:09,850 --> 01:37:14,650
and skinny and I think they pack on way

2354
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:17,199
more THC like the sativa plants they get

2355
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:19,839
you way I prefer that buzz so that's an

2356
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:21,250
ex parte the high indicas are the ones

2357
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,970
when you smoke at the end up laying on

2358
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,380
the couch

2359
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:26,039
that's indica if you need to calm down

2360
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:28,300
if you need to sleep if you need to eat

2361
01:37:26,039 --> 01:37:29,680
that's in because the way to go if you

2362
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,940
need to get the dishes done if you want

2363
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:32,230
to paint if you want to play music and

2364
01:37:30,939 --> 01:37:34,750
get create if you want to ramble on a

2365
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:36,959
podcast smoke some sativas okay yeah

2366
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:40,659
that's that's kind of the opposite there

2367
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:44,489
no no for like a layman like me somebody

2368
01:37:40,659 --> 01:37:47,170
that doesn't do this and I do feel like

2369
01:37:44,489 --> 01:37:49,369
you know this could be advantageous to

2370
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:53,579
writing and stuff like that

2371
01:37:49,369 --> 01:37:59,250
where would I start you know who find it

2372

2374
01:38:04,789 --> 01:38:08,310

01:38:56,579 --> 01:39:00,869
bit and then they'll write it sober and

2400
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:02,340
then smoke a little and go back and

2401
01:39:00,869 --> 01:39:03,720
season it that's like putting the

2402
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:04,949
dressing on it you know back and that's

2403
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:07,140
when you kind of go and sprinkle some

2404
01:39:04,949 --> 01:39:08,279
detail and get a little funk into it all

2405
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:10,079
right that's kind of how I did it as a

2406
01:39:08,279 --> 01:39:12,269
musician - we'd go to like writing

2407
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:14,069
sessions totally sober but then you show

2408
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:15,300
up for Brett practice or recording and

2409
01:39:14,069 --> 01:39:17,549
you smoke a little puff and that's when

2410
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:19,020
you start Oh Oh check it out oh yeah

2411
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:20,640
then you get a little funkier when you

2412
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:23,640
get stoned you just loosen up a little

2413
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:25,470
yeah and I feel like the right strain

2414
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:27,720
some strains don't do this but the right

2415
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:29,820
strain like when you put blinders on a

2416
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:31,619
horse when the horse is at the fair so

2417
01:39:29,819 --> 01:39:32,969
it can't see the [ __ ] on the outside the

2418
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:34,680
left and right eye just focuses on

2419
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:36,810
what's in front of it good weed the

2420
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:38,940
right strain does that to me and it puts

2421
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:42,860
me just boom in the focus if I'm playing

2422
01:39:38,939 --> 01:39:45,539
music or growing weed watching a movie

2423
01:39:42,859 --> 01:39:47,549
playing a video game I'm in that [ __ ]

2424
01:39:45,539 --> 01:39:50,159
like just that it's like goggles for me

2425
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:52,980
humming trimming oh yeah dude give me

2426
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:54,059

2427
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:56,549
me down

2428
01:39:54,059 --> 01:39:58,649
and time flies and I trim the whole crop

2429
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:59,969
it's awesome but but for a nonsmoker

2430
01:39:58,649 --> 01:40:01,169
where they're gonna get started is

2431
01:39:59,969 --> 01:40:01,649
probably just trying to start with a

2432
01:40:01,168 --> 01:40:03,448
pipe

2433
01:40:01,649 --> 01:40:04,800
yeah maybe a joint or a pipe and just

2434
01:40:03,448 --> 01:40:06,779
one or two good puffs is all you need

2435
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,069
well if somebody here drew one puff if

2436
01:40:06,779 --> 01:40:09,988
you got it from the dispenser you take

2437
01:40:08,069 --> 01:40:11,639
two and just put it down and see what

2438
01:40:09,988 --> 01:40:13,108
happens if you don't feel high enough

2439
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:14,699
you'll know we're gonna take your time

2440
01:40:13,109 --> 01:40:16,619
yeah I mean really well some people

2441
01:40:14,698 --> 01:40:17,698
don't you know some people like the

2442
01:40:16,618 --> 01:40:19,139
edible people that have just been

2443
01:40:17,698 --> 01:40:20,578
scarfing the whole snack thinking that

2444
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:22,708
there's Superman and getting hurt and

2445
01:40:20,578 --> 01:40:24,509
[ __ ] see that's something that I had

2446
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:25,828
kind of thought like I was like man the

2447
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:27,780
edibles are probably like where you want

2448
01:40:25,828 --> 01:40:29,788
to start but that's way wrong

2449
01:40:27,779 --> 01:40:31,858
yeah the edibles will sneak up on you

2450
01:40:29,788 --> 01:40:32,908
spence's Naughton one night Spence's

2451

lady

2452
01:40:32,908 --> 01:40:36,898
they made some dads in a pyrex dish like

2453
01:40:34,948 --> 01:40:38,398
you're supposed to do and we had plenty

2454
01:40:36,899 --> 01:40:39,989
so they didn't want to scrape it all out

2455
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,999
you know there's some residuals in there

2456
01:40:39,988 --> 01:40:43,648
she put the dish in the oven to heat it

2457
01:40:41,998 --> 01:40:44,908
up and all the dabs soak to the bottom

2458
01:40:43,649 --> 01:40:47,099
or sunk like in a puddle

2459
01:40:44,908 --> 01:40:50,788
she bought a brownie mix on top of that

2460
01:40:47,099 --> 01:40:52,679
[ __ ] and I think there were four or six

2461
01:40:50,788 --> 01:40:55,349
grown men in that room that ate that

2462
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:57,569
[ __ ] and all of us were comatose it

wrecked us and I can't get that high

2464
01:40:57,569 --> 01:41:01,589
from smoking like it would take all day

2465
01:40:59,099 --> 01:41:03,569
to smoke that much so that's that's pro

2466

01:41:12,059 --> 01:41:16,469
something where I don't know where the

2472
01:41:13,849 --> 01:41:18,599
where my thoughts came from on that like

2473
01:41:16,469 --> 01:41:20,189
I I guess I just thought you know you

2474
01:41:18,599 --> 01:41:21,149
would you would just start with brownies

2475
01:41:20,189 --> 01:41:22,439
or something just have a piece of a

2476
01:41:21,149 --> 01:41:24,838
brownie and that's where you'll start Oh

2477
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:27,329
to last four or five times longer if you

2478
01:41:24,838 --> 01:41:30,448

01:44:21,010 --> 01:44:26,050
millimeter flux now cuz that's what I

2557
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:28,920
flux with is there a strange for a

2558
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:31,810
non-user that you would recommend that

2559
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:34,840
is setting on user a medical patient or

2560
01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:38,350
just a recreational smoker this is gonna

2561
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:40,900
be Rick or you know what I think that's

2562
01:44:38,350 --> 01:44:41,980
I don't know what do you think your

2563
01:44:40,899 --> 01:44:43,420
listeners they're gonna want to hear

2564
01:44:41,979 --> 01:44:46,658
honestly I think they'll want to hear

2565
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:48,340
both yeah for a medical patient I'm

2566
01:44:46,658 --> 01:44:50,259

2567
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:52,329

2570
01:44:53,619 --> 01:44:59,408
questions there Tora Bora is an

2571
01:44:57,550 --> 01:45:02,079
all-around good strain for new smokers

2572
01:44:59,408 --> 01:45:04,000
it's high in CBD it's low in THC you'll

2573
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:05,619
get a nice tingly body buzz if you're a

2574
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,090
new smoker your body will feel good and

2575
01:45:05,619 --> 01:45:08,408
high but you won't freak out you won't

2576
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:11,050
get paranoid

2577
01:45:08,408 --> 01:45:12,969
it's not so high in THC and th TV and

2578
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:14,590
THC aid that your head is gonna spin and

2579
01:45:12,969 --> 01:45:16,060
you're gonna get paranoid cuz that's

2580
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:17,230
what ruins the high for a lot of people

2581
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,090
they reverse sign they're so high

2582
01:45:17,229 --> 01:45:20,678
they're scared and paranoid and freaking

2583
01:45:19,090 --> 01:45:23,170

get head wrecked go for a strong sativa

2587
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:32,229
get some Sour Diesel I'm not sure if

2588
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:35,139
that's really sativa but when I smoke it

2589
01:45:32,229 --> 01:45:37,569
I can't pay any attention like I'm a pro

2590
01:45:35,139 --> 01:45:40,630
and Sour Diesel messes me up I can't sit

public up that you guys just did how

2621
01:46:44,119 --> 01:46:50,869
prestigious is that how many entries and

2622
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:54,590
stuff like that are there how many their

2623
01:46:50,869 --> 01:46:56,750
first debate okay so everybody's first

2624
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:59,210
event is kind of you know it's the first

2625
01:46:56,750 --> 01:47:02,109
one so nobody knows exactly what to do

2626
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:07,730
yeah but I mean there was entries from

2627
01:47:02,109 --> 01:47:12,349
Penrose local pueblo dispensary pueblo a

2628
01:47:07,729 --> 01:47:14,119
couple other local growers so it was I

2629
01:47:12,350 --> 01:47:19,550
mean it wasn't a large event but I mean

2630
01:47:14,119 --> 01:47:21,979
because it was the first you are they

2631
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:23,539
gonna do it or is it gonna be I think

2632
01:47:21,979 --> 01:47:26,238
it'll be annually oh yeah I think this

2633
01:47:23,539 --> 01:47:34,460
plant and and is there a reason they did

2634
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:36,500
it in April 420 that one I got it's like

2635
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:38,300
our Super Bowl yeah and actually with

2636
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:41,119
the cannabis scope it's rapidly becoming

2637
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:43,460
that I heard literally yeah I was

2638
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:44,809
thinking um that maybe there was

2639
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:46,250
something to do with the growth cycle or

2640
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:48,289
something like a good harvesting time

2641
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:52,130
that that would have been that's why but

2642
01:47:48,289 --> 01:47:54,219
maybe I don't know when if you are doing

2643
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:56,989
it outdoors you're not gonna have like

2644
01:47:54,219 --> 01:48:00,319
indoor conditions like that you can

2645
01:47:56,988 --> 01:48:03,649
control your outdoors so when is the

2646
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:05,630
harvest when you're outdoors oh yeah

2647
01:48:03,649 --> 01:48:08,319
right around Halloween course depending

2648
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:13,670
it depends on strange conditions yes

2649
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:16,130
right before the first snowfall yeah no

2650
01:48:13,670 --> 01:48:16,789
you go cut that [ __ ] Colorado you got to

2651
01:48:16,130 --> 01:48:18,949
let him go right

2652
01:48:16,789 --> 01:48:21,680
then sometimes or you pull out the hoop

2653
01:48:18,949 --> 01:48:24,739
houses and the heaters people get

2654
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:26,810
elaborate but basically right around

2655
01:48:24,739 --> 01:48:29,929
Halloween is usually about harvest time

2656
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:33,020
okay yeah so so why isn't and then how

2657
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:34,900
long after say you harvest and it takes

2658
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:37,160
you a couple weeks to trim everything

2659
01:48:34,899 --> 01:48:38,839
depending on the size of the harvest um

2660
01:48:37,159 --> 01:48:40,250
didn't dried and cured up to three weeks

2661
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:42,680
and then and then after you've done

2662
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:44,140
trimming how long until that weed is

2663
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:46,430
able to be smoked

2664
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:48,350
depending on your thirst for the money

2665
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:50,450
right then or gear it for a couple of

2666
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:53,660
weeks or your trim style too I suppose

2667
01:48:50,449 --> 01:48:55,939
yeah yeah yeah okay and then and then in

2668
01:48:53,659 --> 01:48:59,090
good conditions how long can that we'd

2669
01:48:55,939 --> 01:49:01,219
stay good six months ish I've seen we

2670
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:02,750
last a year but six months is before

2671
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:04,610
it'll start degrading and [ __ ] in a jar

2672
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:07,699
sealed alright so maybe the end of May

2673
01:49:04,609 --> 01:49:09,979
would be the end of excuse me may be the

2674
01:49:07,699 --> 01:49:12,050
end of May would be like the trying to

2675
01:49:09,979 --> 01:49:13,819
get rid of everything so I guess April

2676
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:15,289
20th would be like a good that's the

2677
01:49:13,819 --> 01:49:16,489
time people flush out all their that's

2678
01:49:15,289 --> 01:49:18,140
why you see the dispensaries with all

2679
01:49:16,489 --> 01:49:21,679
their sales they're getting rid of last

2680
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:23,450
year's outdoor stuff oh for 20 yeah I

2681
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:25,310
also think what's a holiday that it's

2682
01:49:23,449 --> 01:49:27,349
becoming a lot of growers playing a

2683
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:29,270
shoot for that they plant and there's

2684
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:30,350
like there's cups there's contests you

2685
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:33,290
know I'm saying and there are actually

2686
01:49:30,350 --> 01:49:35,420
uh harvest ball cannabis competitions

2687
01:49:33,289 --> 01:49:36,859
but we're so busy if you got a big

2688
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:38,600
outdoor girl you're just too busy at

2689
01:49:36,859 --> 01:49:40,250
that season even do anything you've got

2690
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:41,660
a big harvest you're trying to trim it

2691
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:42,800
curious you got to flip it you gotta pay

2692
01:49:41,659 --> 01:49:44,389
your trimmers you got to get back

2693
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,220
cleaned up you got to get [ __ ] going

2694
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:49,220
like it's a busy time of year so make

2695
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:50,930
sense no that's that's all good

2696
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:52,970
information that you know if somebody

2697
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:54,710
was wanting to attend one of those

2698
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:56,750
there's a good reason that it's in April

2699
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:59,199
like that you're not super busy at that

2700
01:49:56,750 --> 01:50:01,399
part when when are you starting like

2701
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:10,340
when you start plants and stuff when

2702
01:50:01,399 --> 01:50:15,139
you're outside now yeah June 1st is a

2703
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:17,569
good day I mean set somewhere towards

2704
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:19,048
the end of July beginning of September

2705
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:24,478
to say that right

2706
01:50:19,048 --> 01:50:25,998
August August yeah with my brain that's

2707
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:31,378
what most strange will start flowering

2708
01:50:25,998 --> 01:50:32,818
okay outdoors I've seen plants you know

2709
01:50:31,378 --> 01:50:33,538
go a little faster than what they did

2710
01:50:32,819 --> 01:50:37,289
indoors

2711
01:50:33,538 --> 01:50:39,148
I've seen the exact opposite but you

2712
01:50:37,288 --> 01:50:43,349
know that's when you go from the it

2713
01:50:39,149 --> 01:50:46,019
stops growing and and starts well not

2714
01:50:43,349 --> 01:50:47,519
necessarily stops growing but that's

2715
01:50:46,019 --> 01:50:50,689
what it starts produced seeing a flower

2716
01:50:47,519 --> 01:50:54,479
a fruit and that's the that's the cone

2717
01:50:50,689 --> 01:50:56,399
the bug yeah and that's what we're

2718
01:50:54,479 --> 01:50:58,319
little white pixels yeah for sure first

2719
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:01,260
part you're smoking yeah that part takes

2720
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:04,439
about nine weeks to develop yeah ish

2721
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:08,399
depending on the strain yeah snap [ __ ]

2722
01:51:04,439 --> 01:51:09,809
me up I'm having a good time I didn't

2723
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:12,659
even ask you how your 4/20 was other

2724
01:51:09,809 --> 01:51:16,309
than other than your victory yeah yeah

2725

2727
01:51:19,408 --> 01:51:23,478
side yeah how was that I smoked a lot of

2728
01:51:23,038 --> 01:51:25,708

01:51:25,708 --> 01:51:33,028
yeah it was chaos it was nice checked it

2731
01:51:29,219 --> 01:51:34,229

01:51:37,408 --> 01:51:48,808
Dani Danko giddy up I think that's it

2735
01:51:45,628 --> 01:51:52,048

2749
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:25,909
around you but it was fun I got to see a

2750
01:52:24,538 --> 01:52:30,018
bunch of people that I wanted to meet

2751
01:52:25,908 --> 01:52:30,018
also pick up genetics

2752
01:52:30,059 --> 01:52:33,750
yeah that was a lot of people's goal

2753
01:52:31,618 --> 01:52:35,399
they did a lot of genetics hey uh when

2754
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:44,698
you say pick up a genetics or I mean get

2755
01:52:35,399 --> 01:52:46,109
come on his face buying seeds all the

2756
01:52:44,698 --> 01:52:47,759
breeders go and they have booths all the

2757
01:52:46,109 --> 01:52:50,158
seed makers yeah so you could buy seeds

2758
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,539
of almost all the hottest strains most

2759
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:53,098
of the hottest strains on the market you

2760
01:52:51,538 --> 01:52:55,679
could pick those up at the cup for

2761
01:52:53,099 --> 01:52:56,819
discount prices and if you know the guys

2762
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:58,288
and he make buddies they'll throw you

2763
01:52:56,819 --> 01:52:59,670
freebies and [ __ ] if you buy intro from

2764
01:52:58,288 --> 01:53:02,038
them a lot cheaper and you get some

2765
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:07,699
hookups no are those like feminized when

2766
01:53:02,038 --> 01:53:11,488
they come some Sam and reg yeah what

2767
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:16,049
what would um what constitutes it being

2768
01:53:11,488 --> 01:53:17,908
feminized like it will 99.9% of those

2769
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:20,900
plants will be females will grow from

2770
01:53:17,908 --> 01:53:20,899
those seeds Yeah right

2771
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:26,819
and then you get G papa yeah there's

2772
01:53:24,630 --> 01:53:28,949
some strains that have failed and this

2773
01:53:26,819 --> 01:53:30,448
is breeding techniques some genes don't

2774
01:53:28,948 --> 01:53:31,618
match up properly so they don't make

2775
01:53:30,448 --> 01:53:33,328
good seeds and you have to throw those

2776
01:53:31,618 --> 01:53:35,429
away but that has come from a specific

2777
01:53:33,328 --> 01:53:39,058
plant that are going to produce female

2778
01:53:35,429 --> 01:53:41,368
plants female seeds feminized seeds so

2779
01:53:39,059 --> 01:53:43,440
why take a female plant and I treat it a

2780
01:53:41,368 --> 01:53:45,808
specific way and that makes it turn into

2781
01:53:43,439 --> 01:53:47,759
a male mm-hmm but it doesn't actually

2782
01:53:45,809 --> 01:53:49,590
have any male genetics in it I just kind

2783
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:51,510
of stressed it to do that hmm and so

2784
01:53:49,590 --> 01:53:53,819
when it produces that pollen there's no

2785
01:53:51,510 --> 01:53:55,710
male chromosomes in there Wow so when it

2786
01:53:53,819 --> 01:53:58,529
hits the female it's only female

2787
01:53:55,710 --> 01:54:00,719
genetics that are combining once women

2788
01:53:58,529 --> 01:54:02,578
figure it out or all folks

2789
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:06,868
yeah females I hope you weren't

2790
01:54:02,578 --> 01:54:09,479
listening to that [ __ ] [ __ ] I explained

2791
01:54:06,868 --> 01:54:12,269
it to my girlfriend once and that was

2792
01:54:09,479 --> 01:54:14,819
kind of my replay replay we just end the

2793
01:54:12,270 --> 01:54:16,500
show with a suction sound and we're all

2794
01:54:14,819 --> 01:54:20,788
done right there once women figure it

2795
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:23,210
out we're [ __ ] us again the hate tweets

2796
01:54:20,788 --> 01:54:26,090
we're gonna get

2797
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:28,710
our listeners loved us they're all stone

2798
01:54:26,090 --> 01:54:30,539
alright so you're at the cup did you go

2799
01:54:28,710 --> 01:54:34,670
to some concert I saw some pictures bro

2800
01:54:30,539 --> 01:54:37,649
um yeah I went to a dizzy concert he's

2801
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:40,949
somewhat of a new hip-hop artist out of

2802
01:54:37,649 --> 01:54:42,839
Las Vegas he's got a good movement you

2803
01:54:40,949 --> 01:54:46,079
know he's all about like he makes a song

2804
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:48,449
called world peace you know and he

2805
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:51,229
smokes a lot of herbs so I was fortunate

2806
01:54:48,449 --> 01:54:53,369
enough to be able to give him to lead

2807
01:54:51,229 --> 01:54:56,219
because who knows where he's getting his

2808
01:54:53,369 --> 01:54:58,050
weed from so I figured hey I'll give you

2809
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:59,640
some weed Instagram because he was

2810
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:00,779

2813
01:55:02,039 --> 01:55:06,180
garden of Weeden jar and he looks faded

2814
01:55:04,170 --> 01:55:07,260
I think he's actually next to you

2815
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:09,750

2816

01:56:42,189 --> 01:56:47,739
yeah I'm not interesting at all that's

2858
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:49,450
interesting guys you want to stretch out

2859
01:56:47,739 --> 01:56:49,989
one more question we are like about 10

2860
01:56:49,449 --> 01:56:53,050
more minutes

2861
01:56:49,989 --> 01:56:59,260
sure more good question I I know that

2862
01:56:53,050 --> 01:57:01,449
like hemp is important for for just

2863
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:06,070
becoming a better society honestly like

2864
01:57:01,449 --> 01:57:08,769
there's so much we can do with it I know

2865
01:57:06,069 --> 01:57:12,699
that we can only grow it or can we grow

2866
01:57:08,770 --> 01:57:15,780
it now is that like is that legal

2867
01:57:12,699 --> 01:57:19,029
now can we grow it like in a field

2868
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:21,789
untested oh well in a field never end us

2869
01:57:19,029 --> 01:57:25,929
that's another question I thought you

2870
01:57:21,789 --> 01:57:30,069
meant in a garden like well I think so

2871
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:31,570
because until now dr. Bronner's had to

2872
01:57:30,069 --> 01:57:32,829
buy all of their hemp in Canada and have

2873
01:57:31,569 --> 01:57:34,750
it shipped here and I'm pretty sure that

2874
01:57:32,829 --> 01:57:36,550
the first hemp crop that was produced in

2875
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:38,770
America was purchased here in Colorado

2876
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:40,539
it was purchased by dr. Bronner's so

2877
01:57:38,770 --> 01:57:42,910
there's some legal way that we can grow

2878
01:57:40,539 --> 01:57:47,170
him crops here now I'm ignorant to that

2879
01:57:42,909 --> 01:57:49,750
okay yeah I unfortunately don't know all

2880
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:52,480
the specifics you guys are growing for

2881
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:53,649
different purposes completely yeah but

2882
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:54,909
that's a good question that we should

2883
01:57:53,649 --> 01:57:56,199
understand because that's a part of our

2884
01:57:54,909 --> 01:57:58,750
industry and hemp is really reliable

2885
01:57:56,199 --> 01:58:00,639
that's something I can show you oh okay

2886
01:57:58,750 --> 01:58:03,760
the government did just do something to

2887
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:05,260
make it there was a hint bill I'm gonna

2888
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:07,989
sound really ignorant but I'll give you

2889
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:11,230
this much yeah there was a hint building

2890
01:58:07,989 --> 01:58:12,639
got approved and then in Colorado I

2891
01:58:11,229 --> 01:58:16,209
believe they just issued the first

2892
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:18,880
licenses this year the actual license

2893
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:21,819
that last year's crop was just kind of

2894
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:25,930
crazy own testing the boundaries getting

2895
01:58:21,819 --> 01:58:27,789
the guys feet wet but uh yeah in in a

2896
01:58:25,930 --> 01:58:31,480
nutshell that's so like the first

2897
01:58:27,789 --> 01:58:34,720
industrial license industrial hemp crop

2898
01:58:31,479 --> 01:58:39,399
I saw pictures of crop yeah it was down

2899
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:40,960
in our Springfield yeah hemp drop on the

2900
01:58:39,399 --> 01:58:42,099
on the notes here that'll be somebody

2901
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,569
I'll try to talk about on one of the

2902
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:45,900
next upcoming shows that's a good topic

2903
01:58:43,569 --> 01:58:48,299
um Adam Dunn would be

2904
01:58:45,899 --> 01:58:50,159
pretty good answer this close well yeah

2905
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:51,810
I'll see him up at hood lab pretty soon

2906
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:53,460
here shoutout to the hood lab here those

2907
01:58:51,810 --> 01:58:55,470
guys threw an awesome party here though

2908
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:56,640
if I didn't ask you about your 4/20 bro

2909
01:58:55,470 --> 01:59:04,079
we talked about that in the last show so

2910
01:58:56,640 --> 01:59:05,550
yeah yeah so yeah

2911
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:07,800
shadow to Adam doing he threw a hell of

2912
01:59:05,550 --> 01:59:10,650
a party we all hit the hive nail the

2913
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:11,970
ceramic anybody got into reviews or

2914
01:59:10,649 --> 01:59:13,529
opinions you want to throw down and out

2915
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:15,270
of it towards the end of the show I'm hi

2916
01:59:13,529 --> 01:59:19,259
I'm stuttering it's awesome very high

2917
01:59:15,270 --> 01:59:22,350
good I don't mind it um I like the

2918
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:24,060
flavor the flavors a little bit better

2919
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:25,710
than titanium I would say I guess

2920
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:28,800
depending on what you're dabbing good

2921
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:33,149
smooth it's smooth only reason I don't

2922
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:34,949
like it is because I broke mine so it's

2923
01:59:33,149 --> 01:59:38,429
cool it wasn't like it wasn't as

2924
01:59:34,949 --> 01:59:41,340
expensive as titanium so it's it's if

2925
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:44,789
you break it you can probably buy

2926
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:47,039
another one um but I don't know if where

2927
01:59:44,789 --> 01:59:48,329
the directions in yours yeah okay see I

2928
01:59:47,039 --> 01:59:51,000
didn't read directions that's probably

2929
01:59:48,329 --> 01:59:56,489
why I broke a so I guess I am a fan of

2930
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:59,069
it yeah I've been using pretty much

2931
01:59:56,489 --> 02:00:03,809
non-stop since I got it props for the

2932
01:59:59,069 --> 02:00:05,579
nice little rig - yeah sneaky the dudes

2933
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:07,740
that I got it from hooked me up pretty

2934
02:00:05,579 --> 02:00:10,229
nice on it so got a little pendant ring

2935
02:00:07,739 --> 02:00:11,969
from them too so that was [ __ ]

2936
02:00:10,229 --> 02:00:14,219
awesome I don't even remember their

2937
02:00:11,970 --> 02:00:15,810
[ __ ] name I asked him like four times

2938
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:19,590
yeah their sign was hard to read it was

2939
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:22,350
something Street New Jersey maybe Jersey

2940
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:27,449
Jersey Boys that's a mr. Dubois clue

2941
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:40,140
some great Chris Christie if you're

2942
02:00:27,449 --> 02:00:43,439
listening which I'm sure you are did you

2943
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:44,220
have any opinions on it I'm like I said

2944
02:00:43,439 --> 02:00:46,289
I'm a big guy

2945
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:51,680
it scares me yeah that's cool just the

2946
02:00:46,289 --> 02:00:56,159
mic it was smooth it's it's hard to tell

2947
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:57,000
how hot it is like that was mine like

2948
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:58,619
you say I'm a big

2949
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:03,210
I'm kind of afraid to break it yeah I

2950
02:00:58,619 --> 02:01:04,949
think I'm not a highly educated see I

2951
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:06,720
didn't pay him to say that he doesn't

2952
02:01:04,949 --> 02:01:08,309
even know that the show is sponsored by

2953
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:16,560
highly educated titanium products he

2954
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:18,660
didn't know that so the show spot I'm

2955
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:20,730
sure he's probably just mute - I know

2956
02:01:18,659 --> 02:01:26,189
yeah it doesn't even yeah it's just like

2957
02:01:20,729 --> 02:01:28,399
when you're a girl give me some seeds no

2958
02:01:26,189 --> 02:01:30,869
those don't exist any one about clones

2959
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:32,519
so it's my turn I like the hive did it

2960
02:01:30,869 --> 02:01:33,840
taste good you're right it's hard itself

2961
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:35,340
it's hard enough I agree with that I'm a

2962
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:38,340
big guy I'm afraid I'm gonna break it I

2963
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:40,470
agree with that I can't use my

2964
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:42,090
pre-existing card cap and dagger that

2965
02:01:40,470 --> 02:01:44,850
I'm in love with and so I'm gonna buy

2966
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:46,529
all new [ __ ] for that which I mean for

2967
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:48,870
me that's not a big deal I do okay but

2968
02:01:46,529 --> 02:01:50,159
some people are not privileged in doing

2969
02:01:48,869 --> 02:01:52,199
well and they can only buy a few dad

2970
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:54,059
things so I guess here's my my sum up if

2971
02:01:52,199 --> 02:01:54,899
you can only buy one nail get titanium

2972
02:01:54,060 --> 02:01:56,970
because you're gonna break the hive

2973
02:01:54,899 --> 02:01:58,109
eventually for sure but if you're

2974
02:01:56,970 --> 02:01:59,970
spoiled and you want to try something

2975
02:01:58,109 --> 02:02:01,799
cool if you're a spoiled hash bag for

2976
02:01:59,970 --> 02:02:04,409
your connoisseur so if you're from

2977
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:07,020
Colorado I personally don't recommend it

2978
02:02:04,409 --> 02:02:12,689
for like your travel rigs like towards

2979
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:14,790
bounce it around and [ __ ] like just

2980
02:02:12,689 --> 02:02:17,129
chill it on the table put it on your

2981
02:02:14,789 --> 02:02:19,699
coil home if you know what I mean by

2982
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:22,140
coil then you got a coil condenser

2983
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:23,309
there's no way to hook it up to it so

2984
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:24,690
far that I know of I could be totally

2985
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:27,870
wrong I've never seen a way to hook it

2986
02:02:24,689 --> 02:02:29,609
up to an email uh yeah once they get

2987
02:02:27,869 --> 02:02:32,519
that going I think that constant he

2988
02:02:29,609 --> 02:02:33,779
would probably bust it that would be you

2989
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:36,740
should be using a honey hole anyway if

2990
02:02:33,779 --> 02:02:38,449
you're doing that shout out Joel Halen I

2991
02:02:36,739 --> 02:02:43,590
definitely do like highly-educated

2992
02:02:38,449 --> 02:02:45,750
titanium for sure if you can only afford

2993
02:02:43,590 --> 02:02:48,150
one nail definitely educated either the

2994
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:49,770
whatever size you got go for the duality

2995
02:02:48,149 --> 02:02:52,109
that's probably my favorite nail of all

2996
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:55,350
of there's the duality you know the flux

2997
02:02:52,109 --> 02:02:58,308
the turbine flux that's the so that the

2998
02:02:55,350 --> 02:03:00,110
flux is the one here it's got

2999
02:02:58,309 --> 02:03:02,480
and then the turbine flux has like a

3000
02:03:00,109 --> 02:03:04,908
cone shape on the inside so kind of

3001
02:03:02,479 --> 02:03:07,279
swirls around the turbine flux is my

3002
02:03:04,908 --> 02:03:08,538
favorite my second if you have a dome

3003
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:11,509
the turbine flux if you're going

3004
02:03:08,538 --> 02:03:14,179
domeless go for the duality yeah that's

3005
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:19,159
and then a carb cap of course and I use

3006
02:03:14,179 --> 02:03:21,139
my carb cap on my domed rig to go that

3007
02:03:19,158 --> 02:03:22,549
was a fat plug right there man yeah that

3008
02:03:21,139 --> 02:03:24,230
was nice cool

3009
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:25,489
one more question broke because that was

3010
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:28,968
a quick question and it ended up more of

3011
02:03:25,488 --> 02:03:30,589
us rambling about him um like what laws

3012
02:03:28,969 --> 02:03:33,948
are coming out right now that we need to

3013
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:37,429
be aware of like I know that like on the

3014
02:03:33,948 --> 02:03:38,569
iGrow culture twitter you had posted a

3015
02:03:37,429 --> 02:03:40,550
few things like

3016
02:03:38,569 --> 02:03:42,019
look at look at these guys look at these

3017
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:42,889
guys there are two of them that we

3018
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:47,420
should pay attention to

3019
02:03:42,889 --> 02:03:49,880
SB 77 and 78 is the drug endangered

3020
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:51,649
Child Act they're gonna make it to our

3021
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:55,760
what's hum and that's a weird sound it

3022
02:03:51,649 --> 02:03:57,799
sounds like a drag car Wow Wow dude what

3023
02:03:55,760 --> 02:04:00,889
do you guys got some gas over there some

3024

Taco Bell so uh SB 77 and 78 the drug

3025
02:04:00,889 --> 02:04:06,440
endangered child act it basically has

3026
02:04:03,529 --> 02:04:09,019
accidentally aimed at cannabis users if

3027
02:04:06,439 --> 02:04:10,519

3028
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:12,320
home and you have children you're

3029
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:16,730
endangering your child maybe not

3030
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:19,250
accidentally yeah that was another part

3031
02:04:16,729 --> 02:04:21,439
of my rant on that too is giving kids

3032
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:22,550
cannabis now because it helps so that's

3033
02:04:21,439 --> 02:04:24,769
something we need to fight against

3034
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:26,690
because that accidentally like if I had

3035
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:28,340
this in another room and my daughter was

3036
02:04:26,689 --> 02:04:29,928
on the couch that's a drug endangered

3037
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:31,610
child in their eyes with the new axe so

3038
02:04:29,929 --> 02:04:33,380
we need to fight that down and on the

3039
02:04:31,609 --> 02:04:35,269
Instagram for agriculture or on the

3040
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:37,940
Twitter there's plenty of info of people

3041
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:39,949
to email and talk [ __ ] to about that the

3042
02:04:37,939 --> 02:04:41,839
other one I can't remember the numbers

3043
02:04:39,948 --> 02:04:44,808
of it it's a caregiver act that's trying

3044
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:46,550
to limit Colorado caregivers to 30

3045
02:04:44,809 --> 02:04:49,159
plants maximum no matter what your

3046
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:52,190
location or status okay that's gonna

3047
02:04:49,158 --> 02:04:53,299
[ __ ] a lot of reasons for several

3048
02:04:52,189 --> 02:04:55,339
reasons we went over it on a whole

3049
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:56,809
episode but if you're if you have a

3050
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:58,639
perpetual grow and you've got five

3051
02:04:56,809 --> 02:05:01,400
patients that require the amount of dabs

3052
02:04:58,639 --> 02:05:02,279
that my patients require 30 plants won't

3053
02:05:01,399 --> 02:05:04,159
cut it yeah

3054
02:05:02,279 --> 02:05:06,029
yeah and a lot of people grow small

3055
02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:07,380
hydroponic plants and there's a reason

3056
02:05:06,029 --> 02:05:10,139
why their doctors recommended them a

3057
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:11,369
certain amount of plants and now there's

3058
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:13,020
gonna be a new law it's like we're

3059
02:05:11,369 --> 02:05:15,000
playing football we're playing football

3060
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:15,960
right you caught this pass you got super

3061
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,189
close to the endzone

3062
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:18,449
you got tackled you're cool right you're

3063
02:05:17,189 --> 02:05:19,799
doing good but then suddenly the breath

3064
02:05:18,449 --> 02:05:22,050
comes out and goes oh wait new rule new

3065
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:23,640
rule you can't wear purple how you want

3066
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:25,409
a purple back the [ __ ] up twenty yards

3067
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:26,700
and you're like wait wait I didn't know

3068
02:05:25,409 --> 02:05:28,829
about that rule you just made and that's

3069
02:05:26,699 --> 02:05:31,019
what they're doing to us caregivers have

3070
02:05:28,829 --> 02:05:34,649
been around for 14 years you know as

3071
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:37,890
long as a minimum 20 has been no issues

3072
02:05:34,649 --> 02:05:39,359
up until now and it's all about the

3073
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:41,130
patients and the caregivers without that

3074
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:42,839
relationship it wouldn't exist the whole

3075
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:44,220
model would fall apart and they're

3076
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:45,750
trying to make more people have to shop

3077
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:47,640
in dispensaries and the dispensaries are

3078
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:49,319
already out of medical weed but they

3079
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,700
have plenty of recreational weed which i

3080
02:05:49,319 --> 02:05:53,309
think is a whole other rant that's

3081
02:05:50,699 --> 02:05:54,869
[ __ ] so that's it's about money in

3082
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:58,110
the long run is what I think taking the

3083
02:05:54,869 --> 02:05:59,550
money away from and it's not they don't

3084
02:05:58,109 --> 02:06:01,439
realize we don't make any money being a

3085
02:05:59,550 --> 02:06:03,119
caregiver there's no money in it because

3086
02:06:01,439 --> 02:06:04,349
we don't take a lot of money from our

3087
02:06:03,119 --> 02:06:06,059
patients because they're sick people

3088
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:07,620
there most of them don't work like the

3089
02:06:06,060 --> 02:06:09,390
people I work with don't have a real job

3090
02:06:07,619 --> 02:06:11,609
that are actually sick so I don't take

3091
02:06:09,390 --> 02:06:13,680
money from them and growing weed cost

3092
02:06:11,609 --> 02:06:16,170
time money and energy so I lose money

3093
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:19,530
honestly being a grower like a caregiver

3094
02:06:16,170 --> 02:06:21,050
they're on fixed budgets yeah so we're

3095
02:06:19,529 --> 02:06:23,340
trying to they think that they're gonna

3096
02:06:21,050 --> 02:06:25,350
funnel money into their system from it

3097
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:27,900
which they kind of will but in the long

3098
02:06:25,350 --> 02:06:30,300
run my patients are gonna go in pain or

3099
02:06:27,899 --> 02:06:31,949
sick or what if what if you were working

3100
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:33,270
with cash hi cash I had had a tumor the

3101
02:06:31,949 --> 02:06:34,949
size of a golf-ball the only thing that

3102
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:37,200
was keeping them alive was some cannabis

3103
02:06:34,949 --> 02:06:39,000
oil and if they limit his growers

3104
02:06:37,199 --> 02:06:40,500
production his tumor is gonna grow back

3105
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,659
and he's passed already now

3106
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:44,250
unfortunately bless him but he's a good

3107
02:06:42,659 --> 02:06:46,170
example and he died because they took

3108
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:47,250
away his cannabis and that's kind of

3109
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:48,569
what they're gonna do to people and

3110
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:49,979
people are moving here because of the

3111
02:06:48,569 --> 02:06:52,559
availability and now they're like oh

3112
02:06:49,979 --> 02:06:54,839
rules and I don't find it fair so that's

3113
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:56,160
something we need to shoot down yeah I

3114
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:58,289

function I saw a lot of unity at the

3168
02:08:51,149 --> 02:08:53,639
Cannabis Cup this year I was kind of

3169
02:08:52,229 --> 02:08:55,319
proud because this industry has gotten

3170
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:58,289
cliquey and I didn't see any of that

3171
02:08:55,319 --> 02:08:59,639
[ __ ] at the cup people that people

3172
02:08:58,289 --> 02:09:01,260
that hate each other saw each other and

3173
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:02,670
gave each other hugs and made amends and

3174

lot of topics Kevin and I used to I

3443
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:41,370

02:20:52,670 --> 02:20:58,579
okay it was close okay but that's not

know that you support them because it's

3482
02:21:58,250 --> 02:22:01,370
kind of crap yeah I definitely had a lot

3483
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:04,459
of customers that came into our shop

3484
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:06,380
because we were helping promote the last

3485
02:22:04,459 --> 02:22:08,810
event that unfortunately got cancelled

3486
02:22:06,379 --> 02:22:10,760
but we had a lot of people come in that

3487
02:22:08,810 --> 02:22:12,529
night for the event we're really bummed

3488
02:22:10,761 --> 02:22:14,690
that they couldn't go and partake

3489
02:22:12,530 --> 02:22:16,820
because there most of the people were

3490
02:22:14,690 --> 02:22:19,040
from out of state that recently have

3491
02:22:16,819 --> 02:22:20,959
moved to the area and so they're trying

3492
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:23,150
to meet new people and meet like-minded

3493
02:22:20,959 --> 02:22:24,890
people and it was people of all

3494
02:22:23,149 --> 02:22:26,479
different types and ages and everything

3495
02:22:24,890 --> 02:22:29,119
just like every other cannabis event

3496
02:22:26,479 --> 02:22:31,670
yeah we had everybody it was packed on

3497
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:33,710
that Saturday with these lawyers coming

3498
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:36,591
in to get their herb before going down

3499
02:22:33,709 --> 02:22:38,659
there and then they were just bummed to

3500
02:22:36,591 --> 02:22:41,989
hear that all day it was really

3501
02:22:38,659 --> 02:22:43,970
unfortunate so there they're back in it

3502
02:22:41,989 --> 02:22:45,979
100% as well we got a lot of customers

3503
02:22:43,970 --> 02:22:47,420

02:23:15,049 --> 02:23:19,188
people that I knew already on Facebook

3525
02:23:31,850 --> 02:23:35,630
occasions and now that was such huge

3526
02:23:34,010 --> 02:23:38,329
networking we're just friends now I got

3527
02:23:35,629 --> 02:23:40,519
my job through that place see like the

3528
02:23:38,329 --> 02:23:43,489
manager of the place went down there for

3529
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:45,979
one of our events and invited me to come

3530
02:23:43,489 --> 02:23:48,228
meet the owner and you know start

3531
02:23:45,978 --> 02:23:49,639
working I hadn't had a job for almost

3532
02:23:48,228 --> 02:23:51,319
eight years we used to be able to do

3533
02:23:49,639 --> 02:23:53,239
here just give you some background I

3534
02:23:51,319 --> 02:23:54,500
guess I should rewind a little there was

3535
02:23:53,239 --> 02:23:56,270
a there's this hookah bar they're still

3536
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:57,860
open you can still go in there you can

3537
02:23:56,270 --> 02:23:59,870
get your hookah I think they have a pool

3538
02:23:57,860 --> 02:24:00,950
table and they watch movies in there you

3539
02:23:59,870 --> 02:24:02,479
can still go get your hookah

3540
02:24:00,950 --> 02:24:04,399
on you just can't consume cannabis at

3541
02:24:02,478 --> 02:24:06,438
all in there now so what we would do

3542
02:24:04,398 --> 02:24:07,849
they would post private parties and you

3543
02:24:06,439 --> 02:24:09,739
had to pay a cover charge to get in you

3544
02:24:07,850 --> 02:24:13,100
had to show your ID and once you did

3545
02:24:09,739 --> 02:24:14,659
that they would offer hash like in the

3546
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:17,090
form of dabs which would be either wax

3547
02:24:14,659 --> 02:24:19,430
or shatter and then I would always be

3548
02:24:17,090 --> 02:24:21,049
there with some flowers and Shatter and

3549
02:24:19,430 --> 02:24:22,670
I would just be rolling up fat joints

3550
02:24:21,049 --> 02:24:26,779
and packing bong loads and then giving

3551
02:24:22,670 --> 02:24:28,549
people dabs and the club provided rigs

3552
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:29,840
and torches and we brought our own rigs

3553
02:24:28,549 --> 02:24:32,688
and torches so it was kind of cool we'd

3554
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:36,139
all go hang out I just dab out they

3555
02:24:32,689 --> 02:24:38,239
serve they sold like bottled beverages

3556
02:24:36,139 --> 02:24:40,250
like Mountain Dew and coke and whatnot

3557
02:24:38,239 --> 02:24:41,360
and they would order pizza sometimes if

3558
02:24:40,250 --> 02:24:43,459
there were enough people and sell the

3559
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:45,710
pizza at a fair price and so there was

3560
02:24:43,459 --> 02:24:47,509
nothing wrong going on the cops came in

3561
02:24:45,709 --> 02:24:49,309
one night and walked through and I was

3562
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:50,809
the first person like as you walk in the

3563
02:24:49,309 --> 02:24:53,719
door I'm the first person you see in

3564
02:24:50,809 --> 02:24:54,439
that dude and they looked at me and they

3565
02:24:53,719 --> 02:24:56,659
kind of grinned

3566
02:24:54,439 --> 02:24:58,069
like stupid hippie take your ABS they

3567
02:24:56,659 --> 02:24:59,809
weren't offended they weren't afraid no

3568
02:24:58,069 --> 02:25:01,699
they were they went and talked to the

3569
02:24:59,809 --> 02:25:04,189
owner for a quick second and then

3570
02:25:01,700 --> 02:25:06,020
laughed and that was it and that was

3571
02:25:04,189 --> 02:25:07,850
just their normal like walk through like

3572
02:25:06,020 --> 02:25:09,530
they do at a bar or anything else they

3573
02:25:07,850 --> 02:25:11,329
just walked they didn't check anybody's

3574
02:25:09,530 --> 02:25:11,760
ID they didn't harass anybody they

3575
02:25:11,329 --> 02:25:13,520
didn't

3576
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:16,050
to anybody other than the owners and

3577
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:18,840
they were fine there was nothing wrong

3578
02:25:16,049 --> 02:25:20,009
going on and I said all and so and

3579
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:23,250
that's what I'm getting at is there were

3580
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:25,260
never any fights the most dramatic [ __ ]

3581
02:25:23,250 --> 02:25:27,510
that happened in there was our friend

3582
02:25:25,260 --> 02:25:29,489
Wade's a comedian and he was Wade it's

3583
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:29,969
like the most dramatic scene in that

3584
02:25:29,489 --> 02:25:32,279
place

3585
02:25:29,969 --> 02:25:34,289
we've got obnoxiously loud but it wasn't

3586
02:25:32,279 --> 02:25:36,239
like violently loud yeah it's like dude

3587
02:25:34,290 --> 02:25:37,410
we're high turn down your volume loud it

3588
02:25:36,239 --> 02:25:38,760
was like the worst thing that's ever

3589
02:25:37,409 --> 02:25:41,818
happened sorry Wade I'm just picking on

3590
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:42,930
ya but like really nothing ever went

3591
02:25:41,818 --> 02:25:45,090
wrong in there there were actually

3592
02:25:42,930 --> 02:25:47,398
people as I walked in one night that

3593
02:25:45,090 --> 02:25:48,840
tried to ask me to sell them weed and I

3594
02:25:47,398 --> 02:25:50,159
told them to get the [ __ ] out because

3595
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:51,840
they were gonna ruin a good time I told

3596
02:25:50,159 --> 02:25:53,129
him come on in I'll get you a hi a [ __ ]

3597
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:55,109
but you can't stand out here and buy

3598
02:25:53,129 --> 02:25:57,420
weed let me get the [ __ ] out of here or

3599
02:25:55,109 --> 02:26:00,809
come on in because that will ruin our

3600
02:25:57,420 --> 02:26:02,520
yeah definitely nothing went wrong here

3601
02:26:00,809 --> 02:26:04,799
nothing's going wrong well at the same

3602
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:06,659
time there's a seven bars within a

3603
02:26:04,799 --> 02:26:09,599
walking distance of this hookah bar that

3604
02:26:06,659 --> 02:26:12,510
there are fights at on a regular basis

3605
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:14,010
there's drunk people driving home which

3606
02:26:12,510 --> 02:26:16,950
of course we were probably gonna be dead

3607
02:26:14,010 --> 02:26:18,659
than attempting to drive home but it

3608
02:26:16,950 --> 02:26:20,130
just seems weird that we can't hang out

3609
02:26:18,659 --> 02:26:21,750
and smoke a little cannabis in a private

3610
02:26:20,129 --> 02:26:23,489
hookah bar setting and it's the same

3611
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:25,260
[ __ ] that we ran into are running into

3612
02:26:23,489 --> 02:26:28,619
in Denver this is why the secret cup the

3613
02:26:25,260 --> 02:26:29,818
hash event is damn moved yeah like we're

3614
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:31,470
not even gonna say a word but it has

3615
02:26:29,818 --> 02:26:34,619
been moved to a secluded location it'll

3616
02:26:31,469 --> 02:26:37,318
be much smaller makes it better it makes

3617
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:39,420
it worse it's now we have to limit the

3618
02:26:37,318 --> 02:26:41,930
vending we have to limit attendance and

3619
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:44,879
that makes it less inviting to people

3620
02:26:41,930 --> 02:26:47,520
but it makes it more prestigious so it's

3621
02:26:44,879 --> 02:26:49,769
kind of cool too I think it's just

3622
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:51,960
[ __ ] that uh we can't have a nice

3623
02:26:49,770 --> 02:26:53,760
little smoking spot here in Pueblo or

3624
02:26:51,959 --> 02:26:57,629
anywhere anywhere in Colorado where it's

3625
02:26:53,760 --> 02:27:00,329
legal there are places that I know they

3626
02:26:57,629 --> 02:27:01,469
do puff and I don't want to call them

3627
02:27:00,329 --> 02:27:03,568
out now since they're shutting down

3628
02:27:01,469 --> 02:27:04,889
places but yeah if they're doing that be

3629
02:27:03,568 --> 02:27:06,959
careful you guys keep them going strong

3630

somewhere where they do invite cannabis

3657
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:10,670
in a statement Tuesday and this comes

3658

from it just says the Associated Press

3659
02:28:10,670 --> 02:28:14,960
doesn't really have a a good author

3660
02:28:12,709 --> 02:28:17,478
listed so in a statement Tuesday

3661
02:28:14,959 --> 02:28:19,009
Symphony CEO Jerome Kern says they're

3662
02:28:17,478 --> 02:28:22,279
part of efforts to reach a broader

3663
02:28:19,010 --> 02:28:23,210
audience the state so I'm gonna read

3664
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:25,729
that again in a statement Tuesday

3665
02:28:23,209 --> 02:28:27,319
Symphony CEO Jerome Kern says they're a

3666
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:29,000
part of efforts okay that's where I

3667
02:28:27,319 --> 02:28:30,619
[ __ ] up they are part of efforts to

3668
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:32,659
reach a broader audience the state's

3669
02:28:30,620 --> 02:28:34,250
only full-time professional orchestra

3670
02:28:32,659 --> 02:28:37,010
like others has struggled with doing

3671
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:39,739
billing audiences and budget problems so

3672
02:28:37,010 --> 02:28:41,540
solution listeners are encouraged to

3673
02:28:39,739 --> 02:28:43,909
bring their own marijuana to smoke or

3674
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:45,620
eat to the symphony smoking will be

3675
02:28:43,909 --> 02:28:48,799
allowed at the private venues where the

3676
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:50,870
first 221 of 21 and up concerts will be

3677
02:28:48,799 --> 02:28:53,000
held organizers say they will follow the

3678
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:54,320
rules at the final show and the publicly

3679
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:58,398
owned Red Rocks Amphitheatre where

3680
02:28:54,319 --> 02:28:59,840
smoking is officially banned I got a

3681
02:28:58,398 --> 02:29:01,519
couple things to say there but the last

3682
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:04,100
sentence where smoking is officially

3683
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:13,579
banned at Red Rocks and we just have

3684
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:15,439
snoop and Wiz Kalifa there dude you

3685
02:29:13,579 --> 02:29:17,329
could smoke the [ __ ] out at Red Rocks

3686
02:29:15,439 --> 02:29:18,920
they have stopped giving a [ __ ] I

3687
02:29:17,329 --> 02:29:20,569
remember a few years ago I walked in and

3688
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:22,129
I had a bubbler tucked into my waistband

3689
02:29:20,569 --> 02:29:22,459
like it was a gun said nowhere else to

3690
02:29:22,129 --> 02:29:24,049
put it

3691
02:29:22,459 --> 02:29:26,179
and I figured I could distract him with

3692
02:29:24,049 --> 02:29:28,759
my hands and all my movement my wookie

3693
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:30,139
type skills and so I was cool you let me

3694
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:31,728
through but then the wind blew and it

3695
02:29:30,139 --> 02:29:33,420
highlighted like it rapped my shirt up

3696
02:29:31,728 --> 02:29:34,948
on my body real quick and

3697
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:36,689
my bubbler and he goes what is that and

3698
02:29:34,949 --> 02:29:38,430
I go that's my bubbler and he goes here

3699
02:29:36,689 --> 02:29:40,889
what and I go my bubbler and he looked

3700
02:29:38,430 --> 02:29:42,479
at me and he felt embarrassed that he

3701
02:29:40,889 --> 02:29:44,340
missed it and he goes just get out of my

3702
02:29:42,478 --> 02:29:45,988
line and let me go through yeah he

3703
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:47,219
didn't wanna like cuz he had already let

3704
02:29:45,988 --> 02:29:48,568
me through his boss would have saw him

3705
02:29:47,219 --> 02:29:49,889
pull that [ __ ] out after I already

3706
02:29:48,568 --> 02:29:52,590
passed security so who'd have been in

3707
02:29:49,889 --> 02:29:53,760
trouble but so in an attempt to get more

3708
02:29:52,590 --> 02:29:56,219
people to come to the symphony these

3709
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:58,318

3710

3714
02:30:04,439 --> 02:30:11,040

3724
02:30:36,408 --> 02:30:42,420
yeah so they need to they need to make

3725
02:30:39,779 --> 02:30:44,040
more events like this why can yeah can

3726
02:30:42,420 --> 02:30:50,129
we go smoke at the symphony but not at

3727
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:54,960
the bar has couches snacks and plays

3728
02:30:50,129 --> 02:30:58,528
reggae if I ask them to understand the

3729
02:30:54,959 --> 02:31:00,778
point but I do like that I can [ __ ]

3730
02:30:58,529 --> 02:31:02,699
blaze out as some symphonies yeah those

3731
02:31:00,779 --> 02:31:05,130
things are gonna sell the [ __ ] out right

3732
02:31:02,699 --> 02:31:06,689
they should just let us smoke at every

3733
02:31:05,129 --> 02:31:08,129
concert and not worry because that's

3734
02:31:06,689 --> 02:31:15,000
part of the musical experience we've

3735
02:31:08,129 --> 02:31:16,679
wanted people have been enhancing man I

3736
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:20,579
remember when I used to go see fish one

3737
02:31:16,680 --> 02:31:24,148
night and I it was the date was 8:00 596

3738
02:31:20,579 --> 02:31:28,079
and fish opened up set to with Space

3739
02:31:24,148 --> 02:31:29,760
Odyssey 2001 into Halley's Comet ended

3740
02:31:28,079 --> 02:31:32,068
down with disease into its ice I'm

3741
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:34,889
pretty sure that's the order during that

3742
02:31:32,068 --> 02:31:36,750
little section of music there at some

3743
02:31:34,889 --> 02:31:38,369
point Red Rocks lift it up and spun

3744
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:39,719
around and did a bunch of circles and

3745
02:31:38,370 --> 02:31:41,961
changed colors and then it landed

3746
02:31:39,719 --> 02:31:43,970
perfectly back in place

3747
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:47,439
and that would not have happened without

3748
02:31:43,970 --> 02:31:49,430
a little bit of concert enhancement yeah

3749
02:31:47,440 --> 02:31:50,601
so that's the kind of [ __ ] that's like

3750
02:31:49,431 --> 02:31:52,521
part of what you go for

3751
02:31:50,601 --> 02:31:56,331
that's part of yeah it's part of the

3752
02:31:52,521 --> 02:31:57,440
experience all right so let us smoke

3753
02:31:56,331 --> 02:31:59,511
your concerts that's all we're saying

3754
02:31:57,440 --> 02:32:01,101
let us smoke everywhere I'm gonna take a

3755
02:31:59,511 --> 02:32:04,640

3757
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:06,620
go bro it's actually what it was

3758
02:32:05,569 --> 02:32:07,970
therefore I just wasn't paying attention

3759
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:10,250
I like to set it right out of reach of

3760
02:32:07,970 --> 02:32:11,689
the guest so you get ready and you have

3761
02:32:10,251 --> 02:32:13,791

3765
02:32:17,540 --> 02:32:29,620

edibles begins in Colorado and the

3785
02:33:14,810 --> 02:33:18,681
story's coming from the cannabis it was

3786
02:33:16,550 --> 02:33:23,510
originally written by Erik Gorski from

3787
02:33:18,681 --> 02:33:26,030
the Denver Post sorry clear my throat

3788

ready so for the first time makers of

3789
02:33:26,030 --> 02:33:29,721
marijuana infused cookies cupcakes and

3790
02:33:27,921 --> 02:33:31,911
candies were required to submit samples

3791
02:33:29,720 --> 02:33:33,831
to newly licensed independent labs for

3792
02:33:31,911 --> 02:33:37,251
testing starting Thursday which was May

3793
02:33:33,831 --> 02:33:39,351

3794
02:33:37,251 --> 02:33:41,181
packaged product exceeds the legal limit

3795
02:33:39,351 --> 02:33:43,041
of 100 milligrams of THC

3796
02:33:41,181 --> 02:33:44,961
marijuana's major psychoactive

3797
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:47,140
ingredient it is supposed to be blocked

3798
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:49,189
from reaching recreational store shelves

3799
02:33:47,140 --> 02:33:52,011
manufacturers can fix the problem or

3800
02:33:49,190 --> 02:33:53,751
destroy the badge or you can donate them

3801

02:34:42,351 --> 02:34:45,141
are overdosed

3822
02:34:43,069 --> 02:34:46,729
now the debut of mandatory potency

3823
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:49,340
testing for edibles did not come without

3824
02:34:46,729 --> 02:34:50,930
problems only two labs were cleared to

3825
02:34:49,340 --> 02:34:53,060
start testing Thursday and even those

3826
02:34:50,931 --> 02:34:54,590
haven't yet been fully certified the

3827
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:56,029
state postponed another test that was

3828
02:34:54,590 --> 02:34:57,620
supposed to begin and edible

3829
02:34:56,030 --> 02:35:00,891
manufactures are concerned about a lack

3830
02:34:57,620 --> 02:35:01,971
of standardization and results are all

3831
02:35:00,890 --> 02:35:03,739
over the map

3832
02:35:01,970 --> 02:35:08,000
state officials acknowledged testing

3833
02:35:03,739 --> 02:35:11,530
will not be perfect at the start so the

3834
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:14,299
labs that are testing aren't tested yet

3835
02:35:11,530 --> 02:35:16,820
so how can any of the testing be valid

3836
02:35:14,299 --> 02:35:19,699
but anyway for us it goes back to public

3837
02:35:16,819 --> 02:35:20,899
safety said Louis Cod caused key sorry

3838
02:35:19,700 --> 02:35:23,000
dude I just [ __ ] up your name said

3839
02:35:20,899 --> 02:35:24,409
Louis Koski director of the marijuana

3840
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:27,170
Enforcement Division part of the

3841
02:35:24,409 --> 02:35:28,369
Department of Revenue we'll talk about

3842
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:29,479
that in a second I'm gonna hold my head

3843
02:35:28,370 --> 02:35:31,641
up in the air do remember to review that

3844
02:35:29,479 --> 02:35:34,069
it's a necessary step for us to ensure

3845
02:35:31,640 --> 02:35:36,829
that the product is what it says it is

3846
02:35:34,069 --> 02:35:37,940
on the label the marijuana Enforcement

3847
02:35:36,829 --> 02:35:40,190
Division I've talked about those guys

3848
02:35:37,940 --> 02:35:41,690
before that is basically what it sounds

3849
02:35:40,190 --> 02:35:44,181
like the marijuana Enforcement Division

3850
02:35:41,690 --> 02:35:48,890
they go to your to the dispensaries and

3851
02:35:44,181 --> 02:35:51,620
they have access to everything they also

3852
02:35:48,890 --> 02:35:53,810
go to like private homes and [ __ ] too of

3853
02:35:51,620 --> 02:35:56,150
people who have badges if they suspect

3854
02:35:53,810 --> 02:35:57,949
you're doing something wrong oh wow yeah

3855
02:35:56,149 --> 02:35:59,569
I didn't know I also show up with like

3856
02:35:57,950 --> 02:36:02,870
local cops and [ __ ] that's pretty

3857
02:35:59,569 --> 02:36:04,359
mean-looking if you're doing anything

3858
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:06,470
illegal

3859
02:36:04,359 --> 02:36:11,568
we might want to tell a couple of our

3860
02:36:06,469 --> 02:36:13,340
friends that so just so you know yeah so

3861
02:36:11,568 --> 02:36:16,010
check out what Kevin is says if you're

3862
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:18,738
in Colorado and if you have if you are a

3863
02:36:16,010 --> 02:36:21,978
badged medical marijuana in for an mme d

3864
02:36:18,738 --> 02:36:23,510
badged employee the mme d can bring the

3865
02:36:21,978 --> 02:36:25,188
local police to your house and come to

3866
02:36:23,510 --> 02:36:26,719
your house and investigate to see if you

3867
02:36:25,189 --> 02:36:30,079
are conducting any sort of illegal

3868
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:33,108
activity it think about that you guys

3869
02:36:30,079 --> 02:36:34,158
that a lot of you guys that's yeah give

3870
02:36:33,109 --> 02:36:35,600
us a lot of you guys some [ __ ] to think

3871
02:36:34,158 --> 02:36:37,309
about because a lot of us are private

3872
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:40,790
caregivers and a lot of those guys are

3873
02:36:37,309 --> 02:36:42,709
also gonna have a home grow yeah you

3874
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:44,119
know so but were legit right they can

3875
02:36:42,709 --> 02:36:47,299
have their home grow just as long as

3876
02:36:44,119 --> 02:36:48,560
they're not if they're within there on

3877
02:36:47,299 --> 02:36:50,269
the side or beating their wife on the

3878
02:36:48,559 --> 02:36:52,340
side or having a bunch of guns or some

3879
02:36:50,270 --> 02:36:55,520
[ __ ] they're not getting a crime illegal

3880
02:36:52,340 --> 02:36:57,139
guns right all right that's weird I

3881
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:59,238
guess that's one of the things you sign

3882
02:36:57,139 --> 02:37:01,250
up for yeah I wonder if a lot of people

3883
02:36:59,238 --> 02:37:04,129
paid attention to that that's a whole

3884
02:37:01,250 --> 02:37:06,228
nother show that we should hear your

3885
02:37:04,129 --> 02:37:08,269
rights get pretty effed in the a when

3886
02:37:06,228 --> 02:37:09,978
you apply for badges through them yeah

3887
02:37:08,270 --> 02:37:11,600
so they can come too apparently if your

3888
02:37:09,978 --> 02:37:13,250
a badge a badge employee means that you

3889
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:14,988
have to apply for a medical marijuana

3890
02:37:13,250 --> 02:37:17,148
Enforcement Division employee badge

3891
02:37:14,988 --> 02:37:18,529
there are certain levels of badging that

3892
02:37:17,148 --> 02:37:21,108
are required for different parts of the

3893
02:37:18,529 --> 02:37:23,569
store or job you need those to do

3894
02:37:21,109 --> 02:37:25,729
anything dispensary related grow related

3895
02:37:23,568 --> 02:37:28,430
in a shop that is going to go

3896
02:37:25,728 --> 02:37:31,398
recreational or medical infused products

3897
02:37:28,430 --> 02:37:33,020
and yeah it's all of it so the Mme D or

3898
02:37:31,398 --> 02:37:34,459
the meed the marijuana and for it used

3899
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:35,630
to be the medical marijuana Enforcement

3900
02:37:34,459 --> 02:37:38,329
Division not just the marijuana

3901
02:37:35,629 --> 02:37:40,250
Enforcement Division they can go to any

3902
02:37:38,329 --> 02:37:42,260
dispensary and they can also search the

3903
02:37:40,250 --> 02:37:44,000
employees vehicles that are in the

3904
02:37:42,260 --> 02:37:46,059
parking lots they can search the

3905
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:48,920
employees pockets if they feel the need

3906
02:37:46,059 --> 02:37:50,359
they're there the weed Nazis they're the

3907
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:53,029
ones in charge of all of it so it's not

3908
02:37:50,359 --> 02:37:55,068
just the wild wild west out here a few

3909
02:37:53,029 --> 02:37:57,829
years ago here under we're under strict

3910
02:37:55,068 --> 02:38:00,129
regulation between ten and eight years

3911
02:37:57,829 --> 02:38:04,279
ago it was the wild wild west around

3912
02:38:00,129 --> 02:38:07,818
2007 liked 2010 ish I think it was nuts

3913
02:38:04,279 --> 02:38:10,460
around here you there was no Enforcement

3914
02:38:07,818 --> 02:38:12,318
Division you would open up a dispensary

3915
02:38:10,459 --> 02:38:14,629
and home growers or caregivers would

3916
02:38:12,318 --> 02:38:16,760
bring their products to the shop and

3917
02:38:14,629 --> 02:38:17,959
offer you you want to buy this pound of

3918
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:19,579
weed and you buy that pound of

3919
02:38:17,959 --> 02:38:22,519
put it on your shelf like it was no

3920
02:38:19,579 --> 02:38:24,170
thing all you needed was a red card we

3921
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:26,780
didn't give a [ __ ] back in those days I

3922
02:38:24,170 --> 02:38:29,659
missed that time over-regulation is

3923
02:38:26,780 --> 02:38:31,550
making things weird so I'm gonna

3924
02:38:29,659 --> 02:38:33,649
continue the article a new the new

3925
02:38:31,549 --> 02:38:35,209
testing comes amid growing scrutiny of

3926
02:38:33,649 --> 02:38:37,129
the edible marijuana products with two

3927
02:38:35,209 --> 02:38:39,019
recent deaths linked to edibles hospital

3928
02:38:37,129 --> 02:38:40,670
emergency rooms reporting more patients

3929
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:43,190
reacting badly to edibles and state

3930
02:38:40,670 --> 02:38:44,540
legislators and regulators nine I never

3931
02:38:43,190 --> 02:38:45,560
mentioned the two deaths on my show

3932
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:47,030
because I don't want to support that

3933
02:38:45,559 --> 02:38:49,159
propaganda is honestly why I never

3934
02:38:47,030 --> 02:38:50,989
talked about it very much in depth I

3935
02:38:49,159 --> 02:38:54,079
think we mentioned the one kid jumping

3936
02:38:50,989 --> 02:38:55,430
one time I don't want to support that I

3937
02:38:54,079 --> 02:38:57,590
don't want to be attached to it I don't

3938
02:38:55,430 --> 02:38:59,000
want to touch it I don't know enough

3939
02:38:57,590 --> 02:39:02,030
about it I don't know what that kid was

3940
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:04,040
on so I avoided it sorry if you felt

3941
02:39:02,030 --> 02:39:06,350
like I should've talked about it

3942
02:39:04,040 --> 02:39:08,240
enforcement division officials say even

3943
02:39:06,350 --> 02:39:10,370
testing labs have been licensed and four

3944
02:39:08,239 --> 02:39:11,750
are being certified an additional step

3945
02:39:10,370 --> 02:39:13,820
carried out with State Department of

3946
02:39:11,750 --> 02:39:15,950
Public Health and Environment to be

3947
02:39:13,819 --> 02:39:17,600
certified labs must meet standards that

3948
02:39:15,950 --> 02:39:19,790
include lab director qualifications

3949
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:21,890
quality control security and sample

3950
02:39:19,790 --> 02:39:23,780
tracking as of Thursday however none had

3951
02:39:21,889 --> 02:39:26,899
completed the process state officials

3952
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:28,370
said two labs receive provisional

3953
02:39:26,899 --> 02:39:30,529
certifications meaning they're in

3954
02:39:28,370 --> 02:39:32,120
material compliance but not through the

3955
02:39:30,530 --> 02:39:33,290
process there's a little fly buzzing

3956
02:39:32,120 --> 02:39:34,700
around me I'm trying to smack it I'm

3957
02:39:33,290 --> 02:39:39,380
hitting everything but the fly that's

3958
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:41,690
[ __ ] funny where did I go okay state

3959
02:39:39,379 --> 02:39:43,939
officials I indefinitely postponed

3960
02:39:41,690 --> 02:39:46,760
mandatory mandatory testing that was to

3961
02:39:43,940 --> 02:39:48,890
begin Thursday for homogeneity basically

3962
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:51,200
making sure THC is spread throughout a

3963
02:39:48,889 --> 02:39:53,779
product and not concentrated in any area

3964
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:55,729
a spokeswoman said the division wants to

3965
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:57,979
take one step at a time to ensure a

3966
02:39:55,728 --> 02:40:01,039
controlled rollout process for testing

3967
02:39:57,978 --> 02:40:02,599
so they're not just gonna slap everybody

3968
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,770
with huge problems if they do come out

3969
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:06,440
kind of wrong because I understand the

3970
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:08,149
lab could be [ __ ] up too they

3971
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:10,329
understand that we have to do this

3972
02:40:08,149 --> 02:40:12,409
slowly just like the cannabis industry

3973
02:40:10,329 --> 02:40:14,809
worked a lot better when it grew slowly

3974
02:40:12,409 --> 02:40:17,450
I believe and now we're in this big

3975
02:40:14,809 --> 02:40:19,340
giant cannabis bubble and it's gonna pop

3976
02:40:17,450 --> 02:40:21,680
somehow because there are a million fete

3977
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:24,680
pin company yeah there are million

3978
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:27,530
edible companies and so I like her idea

3979
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:29,059
of a controlled rollout process like

3980
02:40:27,530 --> 02:40:30,480
that's what we do in the cannabis

3981
02:40:29,059 --> 02:40:33,449
industry that's how we do it you know

3982
02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:35,341
large scale right away because it cost a

3983
02:40:33,450 --> 02:40:37,681
lot of money and we're all grassroots

3984
02:40:35,341 --> 02:40:39,841
companies crap but you know what I mean

3985
02:40:37,681 --> 02:40:41,881
yeah now that grassroots use that name

3986
02:40:39,841 --> 02:40:43,800
they [ __ ] get a lot of promotion and

3987
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:46,109
also that's something we talked about on

3988
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:47,699
another episode the THC being spread

3989
02:40:46,110 --> 02:40:49,771
through a product and not concentrated

3990
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:51,690
in any area like if your chocolate bar

3991
02:40:49,771 --> 02:40:52,950
melts and this is relative to another

3992
02:40:51,690 --> 02:40:54,989
topic I've got coming up if your

3993
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:57,480
chocolate bar melts and it's tipped one

3994
02:40:54,989 --> 02:40:59,190
way and then it's reharden you may have

3995
02:40:57,479 --> 02:41:01,409
just restored all of the [ __ ]

3996
02:40:59,190 --> 02:41:02,971
cannabinoids to one area so I understand

3997
02:41:01,409 --> 02:41:05,521
what they're trying to do and that's

3998
02:41:02,970 --> 02:41:07,289
good because I've got a patient that if

3999
02:41:05,521 --> 02:41:09,271
I gave him 100 milligram edible that

4000
02:41:07,290 --> 02:41:11,011
would be four doses for him if it all

4001
02:41:09,271 --> 02:41:14,641
got moved to one end he'd be really

4002
02:41:11,011 --> 02:41:16,860
[ __ ] up one time like he'd be bad so

4003
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:18,390
I'll continue Koski said earlier this

4004
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:20,190
week he was confident Labs can handle

4005
02:41:18,390 --> 02:41:22,500
potency testing for the roughly forty

4006
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:25,051
forty Colorado businesses making edible

4007
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:28,021
products for recreational use so the

4008
02:41:25,050 --> 02:41:30,091
company has to make him/her test him her

4009
02:41:28,021 --> 02:41:32,450
the company has to front the testing not

4010
02:41:30,091 --> 02:41:35,579
the dispensaries which is kind of cool I

4011
02:41:32,450 --> 02:41:37,620
think if the dispensary were required to

4012
02:41:35,579 --> 02:41:39,690
do it the cost would land on the

4013
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:41,011
patients a little more yeah since the

4014
02:41:39,690 --> 02:41:42,421
company is doing it they're gonna take

4015
02:41:41,011 --> 02:41:44,729
they can take the hit a little better

4016
02:41:42,421 --> 02:41:47,190
but among labs and edible companies

4017
02:41:44,729 --> 02:41:48,960
there was uncertainty there always is

4018
02:41:47,190 --> 02:41:51,540
that's how our industry thrives as an

4019
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:53,220
uncertainty I think everybody is

4020
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:55,051
probably in the same situation as me

4021
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:56,970
hanging back waiting to pull the trigger

4022
02:41:55,050 --> 02:41:59,520
on adding instrumentation or personnel

4023
02:41:56,970 --> 02:42:01,560
said Joseph Evans laboratory director of

4024
02:41:59,521 --> 02:42:02,820
steep hill Halen which says it got the

4025
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:04,949
green light to begin the mandatory

4026
02:42:02,819 --> 02:42:09,091
testing shout out to the guys at steep

4027
02:42:04,950 --> 02:42:09,750
hill Halen labs Earl Ripper at Graeme

4028
02:42:09,091 --> 02:42:11,671
Gatsby

4029
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:13,470
that's Addison de Moura John Hunt much

4030
02:42:11,671 --> 02:42:15,989
love you guys that's those are some cool

4031
02:42:13,470 --> 02:42:18,029
guys I really and Joseph Evans also I

4032
02:42:15,989 --> 02:42:19,380
had to pull myself away from a

4033
02:42:18,030 --> 02:42:21,211
conversation with Joseph ER I would have

4034
02:42:19,380 --> 02:42:22,680
been there for like why would a camped

4035
02:42:21,210 --> 02:42:24,300
just to talk to that guy would had just

4036
02:42:22,681 --> 02:42:26,640
sat down on the table bring a lunch I

4037
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:28,470
could talk to him all day one day I'll

4038
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:30,149
get the opportunity you know when we

4039
02:42:28,470 --> 02:42:33,210
talked to Addison he sounds like he

4040
02:42:30,149 --> 02:42:35,310
knows everything about dabs he learned

4041
02:42:33,210 --> 02:42:36,989
it all from Joe yeah I feel oh not just

4042
02:42:35,310 --> 02:42:38,909
Joe by like Joe knows twenty times that

4043
02:42:36,989 --> 02:42:41,250
and our buddy that sits at the table and

4044
02:42:38,909 --> 02:42:41,789
teaches us about chemistry Joe would

4045
02:42:41,250 --> 02:42:43,648
school

4046
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:45,149
yeah and no offense to either those guys

4047
02:42:43,648 --> 02:42:47,250
but Joe is [ __ ] brilliant Joe

4048
02:42:45,148 --> 02:42:49,648
entertains my mind I like it

4049
02:42:47,250 --> 02:42:54,239
so shut up big guy had to talk to that

4050
02:42:49,648 --> 02:42:55,949
dude - we go up there at the table

4051
02:42:54,239 --> 02:42:58,500
willing to talk all we have to do is

4052
02:42:55,950 --> 02:42:59,609
show up at the labs if you call steep

4053
02:42:58,500 --> 02:43:01,950
hill labs and tell them you need some

4054
02:42:59,609 --> 02:43:03,180
information they will they'll do some

4055
02:43:01,950 --> 02:43:04,500
consulting for you if I may charge you a

4056
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:05,790
little bit but you can go up there and

4057
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:07,829
get some consulting done instead it's

4058
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:10,200
really cool yeah I paid my upfront

4059
02:43:07,829 --> 02:43:13,228
consulting fee for a minute so got that

4060
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:15,390
account going so some edible companies

4061
02:43:13,228 --> 02:43:17,099
fear a backlog can the labs handle the

4062
02:43:15,389 --> 02:43:18,869
volume in a timely fashion said Joe

4063
02:43:17,100 --> 02:43:21,840
hotus spokesman for Dixie elixirs and

4064
02:43:18,870 --> 02:43:24,500
edibles of Denver Dixie elixirs hard to

4065
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:27,719
say under dab the [ __ ] out by the way so

4066
02:43:24,500 --> 02:43:30,989
if it was a 24 or 48-hour turnaround for

4067
02:43:27,719 --> 02:43:32,789
voluntary testing becomes two-week

4068
02:43:30,989 --> 02:43:34,318
turnaround that significantly impacts

4069
02:43:32,790 --> 02:43:36,270
our production I [ __ ] up that sentence

4070
02:43:34,318 --> 02:43:37,978
but you got the point Hoda said because

4071
02:43:36,270 --> 02:43:41,279
of inconsistent results in Colorado's

4072
02:43:37,978 --> 02:43:43,289
lab testing industry Dixie has is moving

4073
02:43:41,279 --> 02:43:45,120
to lower the dosage in its hundred

4074
02:43:43,290 --> 02:43:48,000
milligram products to reduce the risk of

4075
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:49,380
failing a test so instead of trying to

4076
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:51,540
get the test right you're just gonna

4077
02:43:49,379 --> 02:43:53,219
[ __ ] lowball yourself and we'll make

4078
02:43:51,540 --> 02:43:54,540
sure see samples from each batch get

4079
02:43:53,219 --> 02:43:57,239
widely different results from different

4080
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:58,920
labs meg Collins executive director of

4081
02:43:57,239 --> 02:44:00,180
the cannabis Business Alliance said the

4082
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:02,250
consistency problem can be addressed

4083
02:44:00,180 --> 02:44:04,439
with data the state collects from

4084
02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:06,209
mandatory testing it's important for the

4085
02:44:04,439 --> 02:44:08,100
state to begin the program and not delay

4086
02:44:06,209 --> 02:44:10,978
it she said if there are wrinkles they

4087
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:14,609
can be worked out go slow that's what I

4088
02:44:10,978 --> 02:44:16,648
recommend so Dan Eldridge and Glen den

4089
02:44:14,609 --> 02:44:19,050
and Glen Evette appear which infuses

4090
02:44:16,648 --> 02:44:20,969
food products with THC disagrees he

4091
02:44:19,049 --> 02:44:23,099
supports a delay in mandatory testing if

4092
02:44:20,969 --> 02:44:24,568
a company relies on a test result that

4093
02:44:23,100 --> 02:44:26,399
underestimates the true level of THC

4094
02:44:24,568 --> 02:44:28,769
companies could end up putting too much

4095
02:44:26,398 --> 02:44:30,059
he said very good point then we're right

4096
02:44:28,770 --> 02:44:32,250
back where we are over at Oh some people

4097
02:44:30,059 --> 02:44:34,049
this is a result of trying to rush

4098
02:44:32,250 --> 02:44:35,760
something to appease public opinion and

4099
02:44:34,049 --> 02:44:38,099
what it's actually doing is putting

4100
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:40,620
harmful public policy in place he said

4101
02:44:38,100 --> 02:44:42,568
the state said is working to contract

4102
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:44,040
with the reference lab a sort of

4103
02:44:42,568 --> 02:44:45,719
independent check on the process that

4104
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:47,750
would be used to verify the results and

4105
02:44:45,719 --> 02:44:52,379
practices of labs conducting the tests

4106
02:44:47,750 --> 02:44:54,478
so they want to hire a lab to test the

4107
02:44:52,379 --> 02:44:55,799
labs that are testing the product

4108
02:44:54,478 --> 02:44:57,299
so we're gonna have to hire a lab to

4109
02:44:55,799 --> 02:45:02,938
test that lab too right

4110
02:44:57,299 --> 02:45:04,709
I would assume which makes sense but man

4111
02:45:02,939 --> 02:45:06,568
this is what happens when you freakin

4112
02:45:04,709 --> 02:45:09,119
over-regulate [ __ ] yeah cuz guess who's

4113
02:45:06,568 --> 02:45:11,398
paying for it the patient's customer

4114
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:12,840
they definitely yeah

4115
02:45:11,398 --> 02:45:14,789
so there's another dollar on every

4116
02:45:12,840 --> 02:45:16,949
product that you buy one more dollar for

4117
02:45:14,790 --> 02:45:19,470
all these tests maybe maybe the dollar

4118
02:45:16,949 --> 02:45:21,029
25 that doesn't sound like a lot but if

4119
02:45:19,469 --> 02:45:22,978
you're an MMJ patient and you're already

4120
02:45:21,029 --> 02:45:25,380
struggling because your wife is rough in

4121
02:45:22,978 --> 02:45:28,198
Colorado where in the world you're gonna

4122
02:45:25,379 --> 02:45:30,059
be [ __ ] broke so dr. Michael wimp

4123
02:45:28,199 --> 02:45:31,470
director of medical chemistry core

4124
02:45:30,059 --> 02:45:33,049
facility at the University of Colorado

4125
02:45:31,469 --> 02:45:36,028
School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical

4126
02:45:33,049 --> 02:45:38,549
Sciences I'm so glad that it's not my

4127
02:45:36,029 --> 02:45:40,050
[ __ ] title would you imagine having

4128
02:45:38,549 --> 02:45:42,000
to write that or introduce yourself that

4129
02:45:40,049 --> 02:45:43,559
hi I'm dr. Michael went director of the

4130
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,969
medical chemistry core facility at the

4131
02:45:43,559 --> 02:45:46,829
University of Colorado School of

4132
02:45:44,969 --> 02:45:49,738
Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical sciences

4133
02:45:46,829 --> 02:45:51,659
that dude that should have come first

4134
02:45:49,738 --> 02:45:53,579
except it's extremely important he said

4135
02:45:51,659 --> 02:45:55,020
how can you release a product to people

4136
02:45:53,579 --> 02:45:57,389
and not know whether the label is

4137
02:45:55,020 --> 02:45:59,220
correct this is the only industry that

4138
02:45:57,389 --> 02:46:02,189
would get away with that also yeah is

4139
02:45:59,219 --> 02:46:03,539
doing that so senior enforcement

4140
02:46:02,189 --> 02:46:04,920
director of the marijuana Enforcement

4141
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:06,600
Division acknowledged that a system

4142
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:08,879
without a reference lab is not perfect

4143
02:46:06,600 --> 02:46:10,859
but mandatory testing and regimented

4144
02:46:08,879 --> 02:46:13,379
testing of the product is better than no

4145
02:46:10,859 --> 02:46:14,550
testing at all he said other testing of

4146
02:46:13,379 --> 02:46:16,379
recreational marijuana will be

4147
02:46:14,549 --> 02:46:19,170
introduced in coming months including

4148
02:46:16,379 --> 02:46:22,639
screening for contaminants that's the

4149
02:46:19,170 --> 02:46:24,750
part I look forward to so basically

4150
02:46:22,639 --> 02:46:26,129
they're trying to roll out this thing on

4151
02:46:24,750 --> 02:46:28,620
the first of the year everybody's got to

4152
02:46:26,129 --> 02:46:30,659
get compliant and everybody but the labs

4153
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:32,729
and the system that they put in place so

4154
02:46:30,659 --> 02:46:35,699
that's how the Mme D works sometimes

4155
02:46:32,728 --> 02:46:37,079
hurry up and wait hurry up and wait what

4156
02:46:35,699 --> 02:46:38,970
I liked is they said that stuff's coming

4157
02:46:37,079 --> 02:46:40,439
up that all of the cannabis will be

4158
02:46:38,969 --> 02:46:42,510
tested in the future all of the hash

4159
02:46:40,439 --> 02:46:44,729
will be tested in the future it will be

4160
02:46:42,510 --> 02:46:46,279
tested for potency and will also be

4161
02:46:44,728 --> 02:46:49,590
tested for contaminants like

4162
02:46:46,279 --> 02:46:51,630
contaminants will be bugs mold and I'm

4163
02:46:49,590 --> 02:46:53,370
hoping that they implement the new stuff

4164
02:46:51,629 --> 02:46:56,188
that steep hill is using and they are

4165
02:46:53,370 --> 02:46:58,680
looking for pesticides the guys at steep

4166
02:46:56,189 --> 02:47:02,100
hill told me that they're able to find

4167
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:04,020
pesticides so if you spray your plants

4168
02:47:02,100 --> 02:47:05,310
when their baby clones little tiny

4169
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:07,261
clones and cups

4170
02:47:05,310 --> 02:47:09,360
you let them grow for two or three weeks

4171
02:47:07,261 --> 02:47:11,011
for weeks you flour them for nine weeks

4172
02:47:09,360 --> 02:47:12,301
you let them dry you trim them you

4173
02:47:11,011 --> 02:47:14,729
harvest them even if they're flush

4174
02:47:12,300 --> 02:47:17,040
properly and taken care of the kids it's

4175
02:47:14,729 --> 02:47:19,859
the professors the scientists the

4176
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:22,170
chemists at steep hill labs can find

4177
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:25,560
those pesticides that you sprayed in

4178
02:47:22,171 --> 02:47:27,271
your buds and your flowers they can

4179
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:28,649
definitely find it in hash they said

4180
02:47:27,271 --> 02:47:31,711
it's way more prevalent in hash because

4181
02:47:28,649 --> 02:47:33,239
you're concentrating everything if we're

4182
02:47:31,710 --> 02:47:34,890

pot shop health inspections this is by

4194
02:48:00,511 --> 02:48:06,211
Boris Sanchez from Fox 31 Denver

4195
02:48:03,739 --> 02:48:07,190

4196
02:48:06,210 --> 02:48:09,779

4197
02:48:07,190 --> 02:48:11,700

4198
02:48:09,780 --> 02:48:13,171

for health inspector at Denver a public

4200
02:48:13,171 --> 02:48:17,130
health inspector is changing the edible

4201
02:48:14,790 --> 02:48:20,040
marijuana business in Denver not only

4202
02:48:17,130 --> 02:48:21,810
does she go oops I said he huh not only

4203
02:48:20,040 --> 02:48:23,880
does she go I think I called that person

4204
02:48:21,810 --> 02:48:25,079
a guy earlier not only does she go into

4205
02:48:23,880 --> 02:48:27,869
local restaurants to make sure their

4206
02:48:25,079 --> 02:48:29,130
food is up to par she now also inspects

4207
02:48:27,870 --> 02:48:30,990
the edibles and recreational marijuana

4208
02:48:29,130 --> 02:48:32,790
dispensaries and the kitchens where they

4209
02:48:30,989 --> 02:48:34,979
are made we don't really look at it as

4210
02:48:32,790 --> 02:48:37,109
an infused product we look at it as food

4211
02:48:34,979 --> 02:48:38,279
said boo who along with her team of

4212
02:48:37,110 --> 02:48:40,200
health inspectors has been making

4213
02:48:38,280 --> 02:48:42,690
unannounced visits to metro area

4214
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:45,409
marijuana businesses since January first

4215
02:48:42,690 --> 02:48:47,819
the focus is to look closely at edibles

4216
02:48:45,409 --> 02:48:49,829
manufacturing process from stem to snack

4217
02:48:47,819 --> 02:48:51,560
how they are cultivating the plants

4218
02:48:49,829 --> 02:48:53,550
asking them about different fertilizers

4219
02:48:51,560 --> 02:48:55,800
fertilizers pesticides and what they're

4220
02:48:53,550 --> 02:48:57,091
using set vu at most dispensaries our

4221
02:48:55,800 --> 02:48:59,279
goal is to look at whether or not

4222
02:48:57,091 --> 02:49:00,751
edibles are being stored properly her

4223
02:48:59,280 --> 02:49:02,671
team has had to establish new

4224
02:49:00,751 --> 02:49:04,681
regulations for how edible products

4225
02:49:02,671 --> 02:49:06,780
should be kept base off based off

4226
02:49:04,681 --> 02:49:09,899
federal rules that already apply to non

4227
02:49:06,780 --> 02:49:12,271
similar cannabis infused products yeah

4228
02:49:09,899 --> 02:49:13,890
have you ever gotten an edible at a

4229
02:49:12,271 --> 02:49:15,841
dispensary dude that you could tell it

4230
02:49:13,890 --> 02:49:17,699
is full-on been melted and like they

4231
02:49:15,841 --> 02:49:19,350
threw in the freezer to fix it like

4232
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:21,120
yeah yeah so they're gonna try to stop

4233
02:49:19,350 --> 02:49:22,680
that because that's messing with your

4234
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:23,880
health that could be dangerous I'm gonna

4235
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:24,899
read right after this drink give me a

4236
02:49:23,879 --> 02:49:31,639
sip time here we go

4237
02:49:24,899 --> 02:49:33,840
sift so I could time out drink time out

4238
02:49:31,639 --> 02:49:36,569
lots of dads and talking man you need

4239
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:37,829
some water all right according to

4240
02:49:36,569 --> 02:49:39,299
records obtained from the Department of

4241
02:49:37,829 --> 02:49:42,450
Health new rules have forced dispensary

4242
02:49:39,299 --> 02:49:43,949
owners oh I said that huh dispensary

4243
02:49:42,450 --> 02:49:45,630
owners dump out a lot of product

4244
02:49:43,950 --> 02:49:47,460
including hundreds of boxes of edibles

4245
02:49:45,629 --> 02:49:50,209
costing manufacturers and dispensaries

4246
02:49:47,459 --> 02:49:52,799
tens of thousands of dollars

4247
02:49:50,209 --> 02:49:53,909
man so these guys had to dump out tens

4248
02:49:52,799 --> 02:49:56,579
of thousands of dollars

4249
02:49:53,909 --> 02:50:00,450
the most prominent prominent example

4250
02:49:56,579 --> 02:50:02,309
hache infused oils boo says that not

4251
02:50:00,450 --> 02:50:05,070
being refrigerated when they should be

4252
02:50:02,309 --> 02:50:06,779
adding that to keep adding that to keep

4253
02:50:05,069 --> 02:50:08,459
products from growing bacteria we'd like

4254
02:50:06,780 --> 02:50:12,150
them to ensure that it's being held at

4255
02:50:08,459 --> 02:50:13,649
41 degrees Fahrenheit or below so while

4256
02:50:12,149 --> 02:50:15,239
you guys are making edibles and having

4257
02:50:13,649 --> 02:50:17,129
edibles why don't you do this for us to

4258
02:50:15,239 --> 02:50:18,510
keep it at 41 degrees Fahrenheit or

4259
02:50:17,129 --> 02:50:19,969
below when you're storing it and that'll

4260
02:50:18,510 --> 02:50:22,409
prevent any bacteria from growing

4261
02:50:19,969 --> 02:50:23,579
that'll do us all a favor and then you

4262
02:50:22,409 --> 02:50:26,639
won't get any trouble for making anybody

4263
02:50:23,579 --> 02:50:28,590
sick so one metro-area hash oil

4264
02:50:26,639 --> 02:50:30,930
manufacturer who did not want to be

4265
02:50:28,590 --> 02:50:33,000
identified is not too thrilled about the

4266
02:50:30,930 --> 02:50:35,520
new rules does it make sense said the

4267
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:37,049
manufacturer who had to recall several

4268
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:39,390
of her products and dispose of more than

4269
02:50:37,049 --> 02:50:41,340
$5,000 worth of edibles though she says

4270
02:50:39,389 --> 02:50:43,379
no one had ever become sick using her

4271
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:44,819
products I personally never seen a

4272
02:50:43,379 --> 02:50:46,438
bottle of olive oil sitting in a

4273
02:50:44,819 --> 02:50:48,750
refrigerator so to me it doesn't make

4274
02:50:46,439 --> 02:50:51,750
any sense at all she said in response

4275
02:50:48,750 --> 02:50:53,280
toy joy says that most other oils sold

4276
02:50:51,750 --> 02:50:56,280
in grocery stores undergo a rigorous

4277
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:57,900
inspection process by the FDA which even

4278
02:50:56,280 --> 02:50:59,760
the oil manufacturer admits would not

4279
02:50:57,899 --> 02:51:01,590
happen with their products when its

4280
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:02,790
infused product there's no laboratories

4281
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:04,860
that would touch anything of that sort

4282
02:51:02,790 --> 02:51:06,360
she said adding that while the recalls

4283
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:07,939
are frustrating she believes though and

4284
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:10,290
her team are doing the best they can

4285
02:51:07,939 --> 02:51:12,510
surprisingly with this industry they are

4286
02:51:10,290 --> 02:51:14,490
extremely compliant they want to ensure

4287
02:51:12,510 --> 02:51:17,909
that whatever product they are producing

4288
02:51:14,489 --> 02:51:19,289
is safe so they are kind of making sure

4289
02:51:17,909 --> 02:51:20,728
that there's quality control now it's

4290
02:51:19,290 --> 02:51:22,830
not the wild wild west like we talked

4291
02:51:20,728 --> 02:51:26,289
about a minute ago don't do that to me

4292
02:51:22,829 --> 02:51:30,489
we might have lost one story

4293
02:51:26,290 --> 02:51:31,689
think I had it was the next one that one

4294
02:51:30,489 --> 02:51:33,879
article disappeared so we're not gonna

4295
02:51:31,689 --> 02:51:36,489
get to read too much about that maybe I

4296
02:51:33,879 --> 02:51:39,309
can get back to it which one was it

4297
02:51:36,489 --> 02:51:40,959
so the Denver Post is receiving a lot of

4298
02:51:39,309 --> 02:51:42,148
questions about it's gonna reload we may

4299
02:51:40,959 --> 02:51:44,679
have internet service back here again

4300
02:51:42,148 --> 02:51:48,099
the Denver Post posted an article about

4301
02:51:44,680 --> 02:51:52,389
a common a Colorado Marijuana guide 64

of political rants so here are some like

4313
02:52:13,629 --> 02:52:19,778
I said the Denver Post post it I'm

4314
02:52:17,409 --> 02:52:22,619
trying to find the author John Ingold

4315
02:52:19,779 --> 02:52:26,020
from The Denver Post this was posted

4316
02:52:22,620 --> 02:52:27,490
this was possible Oh updated January 3rd

4317
02:52:26,020 --> 02:52:30,850
so this is kind of old news and I'm just

4318
02:52:27,489 --> 02:52:32,020
now reading it so there are a lot of

4319
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:33,010
crazy questions here I'm gonna skim

4320
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:35,620
through them I'll read the opening

4321
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:37,180
article on January 1st Colorado became

4322
02:52:35,620 --> 02:52:38,890
the first place anywhere in the world to

4323
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:41,739
allow legal marijuana sales to anybody

4324
02:52:38,889 --> 02:52:43,119
over 21 for any purpose you have you

4325
02:52:41,739 --> 02:52:46,329
have questions about how it works here

4326
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:51,130
are 64 answers to commonly asked

4327
02:52:46,329 --> 02:52:53,109
questions alright so the first question

4328
02:52:51,129 --> 02:52:54,579
which I've been talking about for a long

4329
02:52:53,109 --> 02:52:58,090
time did marijuana become legal in

4330
02:52:54,579 --> 02:52:59,889
Colorado on January 1st 2014 and we all

4331
02:52:58,090 --> 02:53:02,260
know that marijuana was actually legal

4332
02:52:59,889 --> 02:53:04,719
in Colorado prior to 2014 since the

4333
02:53:02,260 --> 02:53:07,029
voter approved amendment 64 went into

4334
02:53:04,719 --> 02:53:09,010
effect on December 10th 2012 it has been

4335
02:53:07,029 --> 02:53:10,840
legal for anyone 21 and over to use

4336
02:53:09,010 --> 02:53:13,600
marijuana or possess up to an ounce of

4337
02:53:10,840 --> 02:53:15,880
marijuana for any purpose even if it's

4338
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:18,520
just as Rolling Stone magazine has put

4339
02:53:15,879 --> 02:53:20,228
it for getting high purposes marijuana

4340
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:21,850
possession and used by people under 21

4341
02:53:20,228 --> 02:53:24,250
who aren't medical marijuana patients

4342
02:53:21,850 --> 02:53:26,170
remains against the law so the follow up

4343
02:53:24,250 --> 02:53:28,420
question what happened on January 1st

4344
02:53:26,170 --> 02:53:30,279
then New Year's Day was the first day

4345
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:33,010
that marijuana could be sold to anyone

4346
02:53:30,279 --> 02:53:35,200
over 21 at specialty license stores

4347
02:53:33,010 --> 02:53:37,398
don't marijuana use possession and sale

4348
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:40,520
remain illegal under federal law

4349
02:53:37,398 --> 02:53:45,198
nowhere else in the world has pot sales

4350
02:53:40,520 --> 02:53:46,819
this legal not even Amsterdam so that

4351
02:53:45,199 --> 02:53:48,260
was kind of their accurate there I give

4352
02:53:46,818 --> 02:53:51,109
him props the next question is where can

4353
02:53:48,260 --> 02:53:53,148
i buy weed more than two dozen shops

4354
02:53:51,109 --> 02:53:55,340
open January 1st for recreational sales

4355
02:53:53,148 --> 02:53:57,139
we here at the Denver Post have compiled

4356
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:59,109
a list of stores that opened and if you

4357
02:53:57,139 --> 02:54:01,549
go to this article in the Denver Post

4358
02:53:59,109 --> 02:54:03,709
they have a they actually have a

4359
02:54:01,549 --> 02:54:04,788
marijuana section so go to that section

4360
02:54:03,709 --> 02:54:07,489
find this article and there's a link

4361
02:54:04,789 --> 02:54:10,220
there of dispensaries in Colorado that

4362
02:54:07,488 --> 02:54:11,840
are open for recreational use my buddy

4363
02:54:10,219 --> 02:54:13,760
here kevro he works at a place called

4364
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:15,709
the spot in Pueblo West they don't pay

4365
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:17,988
for any plugs or anything if you want to

4366
02:54:15,709 --> 02:54:20,060
talk to the kid that I know Kevin knows

4367
02:54:17,988 --> 02:54:21,590
a lot of [ __ ] about weed cuz I'd like to

4368
02:54:20,059 --> 02:54:23,510
toot my own horn and say he probably

4369
02:54:21,590 --> 02:54:26,180
learned a good portion of it from me a

4370
02:54:23,510 --> 02:54:27,770
lot of it and I just know a lot of the

4371
02:54:26,180 --> 02:54:31,248
links and where to find out information

4372
02:54:27,770 --> 02:54:32,869
through you too yeah so I trust that he

4373
02:54:31,248 --> 02:54:34,279
knows what he's talking about 90% of the

4374
02:54:32,869 --> 02:54:35,840
way because he learned it from me and

4375
02:54:34,279 --> 02:54:37,369
our crew and we try to teach each other

4376
02:54:35,840 --> 02:54:40,818
the best and he makes hella good hash so

4377
02:54:37,369 --> 02:54:42,168
he must be learning all right so if you

4378
02:54:40,818 --> 02:54:44,208
guys want to buy weed the next question

4379
02:54:42,168 --> 02:54:45,770
is how does it work the greatest answer

4380
02:54:44,209 --> 02:54:47,239
you basically walk into your store show

4381
02:54:45,770 --> 02:54:51,158
them your ID and make a purchase it's a

4382
02:54:47,238 --> 02:54:53,779
lot like a liquor store there's a lot of

4383
02:54:51,158 --> 02:54:55,699
normal questions are there limits on how

4384
02:54:53,779 --> 02:54:57,289
much I can buy people with the Colorado

4385
02:54:55,699 --> 02:54:59,359
ID can buy up to an ounce of marijuana

4386
02:54:57,289 --> 02:55:01,180
at a time people with an out-of-state ID

4387
02:54:59,359 --> 02:55:03,529
can buy up to a quarter ounce at a time

4388
02:55:01,180 --> 02:55:05,898
the next question is there enough pot to

4389
02:55:03,529 --> 02:55:07,939
go around yes I'm not even gonna read

4390
02:55:05,898 --> 02:55:11,090
their answer yes we got some weed don't

4391
02:55:07,939 --> 02:55:12,408
worry can I make multiple purchases on

4392
02:55:11,090 --> 02:55:14,898
the same day yes

4393
02:55:12,408 --> 02:55:18,078
the only cap how much you can buy it's

4394
02:55:14,898 --> 02:55:19,458
the legal possession limit the only cap

4395
02:55:18,078 --> 02:55:21,498
on how much you can buy is the legal

4396
02:55:19,459 --> 02:55:23,209
possession limit no one who's a non

4397
02:55:21,498 --> 02:55:25,158
medical marijuana patient can possess

4398
02:55:23,209 --> 02:55:27,050
more than one ounce at a time but that's

4399
02:55:25,158 --> 02:55:28,279
up to the customer to abide by there's

4400
02:55:27,049 --> 02:55:30,228
nothing in the state's rules for

4401
02:55:28,279 --> 02:55:32,959
recreational marijuana stores there

4402
02:55:30,228 --> 02:55:34,309
requires them to track the purchase so

4403
02:55:32,959 --> 02:55:36,909
the next obvious question is can I go

4404
02:55:34,309 --> 02:55:39,978
store to store buying weed yes you can

4405
02:55:36,908 --> 02:55:41,270
if you have more than an ounce of weed

4406
02:55:39,978 --> 02:55:42,618
on you you've broken the law at that

4407
02:55:41,270 --> 02:55:44,420
point so you can go get four good

4408
02:55:42,619 --> 02:55:46,280
quarters and then go home

4409
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:50,479
smoked seven grams to go buy seven more

4410
02:55:46,280 --> 02:55:52,670
but if you're a rebel you can do that is

4411
02:55:50,479 --> 02:55:54,709
there a list of marijuana customers that

4412
02:55:52,670 --> 02:55:56,149
will be given no I already know the

4413
02:55:54,709 --> 02:55:57,979
answer but I'll read it to you know I'm

4414
02:55:56,149 --> 02:56:00,199
in mid 64 which is a constitutional

4415
02:55:57,979 --> 02:56:02,029
measure specifically forbids it

4416
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:04,430
the measure states that the department

4417
02:56:02,030 --> 02:56:06,050
shall not require a consumer to provide

4418
02:56:04,430 --> 02:56:07,700
a retail marijuana store with personal

4419
02:56:06,049 --> 02:56:10,069
information other than government-issued

4420
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:11,601
identification to concern to determine

4421
02:56:10,069 --> 02:56:13,789
the consumers age and a retail marijuana

4422
02:56:11,601 --> 02:56:15,710
store shall not be required to acquire

4423
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:17,601
and record personal information about

4424
02:56:15,709 --> 02:56:19,489
consumers other than information

4425
02:56:17,601 --> 02:56:21,560
typically acquired in a financial

4426
02:56:19,489 --> 02:56:23,420
transaction conducted at a retail liquor

4427
02:56:21,560 --> 02:56:25,430
store so that means you will not be

4428
02:56:23,420 --> 02:56:27,440
tracked you wanna you will be on camera

4429
02:56:25,430 --> 02:56:29,930
though the next question is there

4430
02:56:27,440 --> 02:56:31,550
anything that will show that I bought

4431
02:56:29,930 --> 02:56:34,069
weed at one of the shops and it says yes

4432
02:56:31,549 --> 02:56:39,560
you'll be on camera there's a lot of

4433
02:56:34,069 --> 02:56:41,869
stuff about the camera yes you'll be on

4434
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:43,699
camera can i smoke in the store no where

4435
02:56:41,870 --> 02:56:47,150
can I go to consume that's a little

4436
02:56:43,700 --> 02:56:48,620
fuzzy they you can't really smoke

4437
02:56:47,149 --> 02:56:50,420
anywhere in here can I in Colorado

4438
02:56:48,620 --> 02:56:51,500
unless you find like a private bar or

4439
02:56:50,420 --> 02:56:53,271
something I'm not gonna read the stuff

4440
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:55,129
that they said here but there is a

4441
02:56:53,271 --> 02:56:56,960
Colorado's Clean Air Act so pot smoking

4442
02:56:55,129 --> 02:56:59,629
isn't allowed anywhere that cigarette

4443
02:56:56,959 --> 02:57:00,979
smoking is also banned so if you can't

4444
02:56:59,629 --> 02:57:03,350
smoke cigarettes can't smoke weed there

4445
02:57:00,979 --> 02:57:06,020
there have been exceptions made I'm not

4446
02:57:03,351 --> 02:57:08,030
gonna mention them can i puff at a park

4447
02:57:06,021 --> 02:57:11,811
somewhere absolutely not

4448
02:57:08,030 --> 02:57:13,851
ski slope Colorado's winter resorts are

4449
02:57:11,810 --> 02:57:15,979
not all stoked at the possibility of

4450
02:57:13,851 --> 02:57:17,601
stone skiers and what's more most of

4451
02:57:15,979 --> 02:57:19,489
actual ski slopes are on federal land

4452
02:57:17,601 --> 02:57:21,800
where marijuana use and possession

4453
02:57:19,489 --> 02:57:24,949
remains strictly for boating so don't

4454
02:57:21,799 --> 02:57:26,420
smoke at the ski slopes so that means

4455
02:57:24,950 --> 02:57:28,579
taking marijuana on a summer camping

4456
02:57:26,420 --> 02:57:30,200
trip is probably out to yes national

4457
02:57:28,579 --> 02:57:33,021
parks national forests national

4458
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:34,370
monuments all off-limits well I didn't

4459
02:57:33,021 --> 02:57:39,079
even think of that what about apartments

4460
02:57:34,370 --> 02:57:39,950
landlords can say no yeah but there are

every time it gets caught it's [ __ ]

4480
02:58:20,550 --> 02:58:24,300

4481
02:58:21,841 --> 02:58:25,800
that if you want yeah don't do that is

4482
02:58:24,300 --> 02:58:27,720
it okay to drive with marijuana in my

4483
02:58:25,800 --> 02:58:29,220
car the answer is yes as long as you're

4484
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:31,050
transporting it and not consuming if

4485
02:58:29,220 --> 02:58:34,949
driving stoned is absolutely against the

4486
02:58:31,050 --> 02:58:36,689
law ah Colorado this year made it easier

4487
02:58:34,950 --> 02:58:38,790
to win convictions against own drivers

4488
02:58:36,690 --> 02:58:39,989
the state set a standard of how much THC

4489
02:58:38,790 --> 02:58:42,000
the psychoactive chemical in marijuana

4490
02:58:39,989 --> 02:58:43,619
that drivers can have in their system

4491
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:45,181
the driver tests above that the

4492
02:58:43,620 --> 02:58:48,240
prosecutor can tell the jury is okay to

4493
02:58:45,181 --> 02:58:49,079
assume the driver was stoned there's a

4494
02:58:48,239 --> 02:58:51,810
lot more questions

4495
02:58:49,079 --> 02:58:53,039
well my employer be okay with it I'm not

4496
02:58:51,810 --> 02:58:59,220
gonna read their part that's up to the

4497
02:58:53,040 --> 02:59:01,261
employer probably not can I legally

4498
02:58:59,220 --> 02:59:03,300
possess an ounce of marijuana how much

4499
02:59:01,261 --> 02:59:04,440
is that in practical terms it's a lot

4500
02:59:03,300 --> 02:59:09,750
Reacher's of Sookie

4501
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:11,610
so in Alta marijuana 28 grams of a good

4502
02:59:09,750 --> 02:59:13,261
dank herb it'll fill up like one of

4503
02:59:11,610 --> 02:59:15,391
those sandwich baggies just about

4504
02:59:13,261 --> 02:59:17,851
perfectly like that cuz it's fluffy it's

4505
02:59:15,390 --> 02:59:20,359
not good but a sandwich bag full how

4506
02:59:17,851 --> 02:59:23,101
much will it cost is the next question

4507
02:59:20,360 --> 02:59:25,471
in the medical marijuana market ounces

4508
02:59:23,101 --> 02:59:28,021
cost from 150 to close to $300 but

4509
02:59:25,470 --> 02:59:30,060
nobody buys full ounces the more common

4510
02:59:28,021 --> 02:59:32,700
purchase amount is 1/8 think of it like

4511
02:59:30,060 --> 02:59:33,960
a 12-pack it's right around 25 to 45 for

4512
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:35,671
medical marijuana we'll have to wait and

4513
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:40,439
see what stores set the recreational

4514
02:59:35,671 --> 02:59:43,290
prices does that include taxes no right

4515
02:59:40,440 --> 02:59:46,021
now I see prices being advertised for

4516
02:59:43,290 --> 02:59:47,280
rec shops right about 200 to 250 an

4517
02:59:46,021 --> 02:59:48,780
ounce for good stuff what do you charge

4518
02:59:47,280 --> 02:59:50,700
of your shop for rec shops

4519
02:59:48,780 --> 02:59:52,711
that's about medical sorry that's

4520
02:59:50,700 --> 02:59:54,240
totally what I meant yeah med shops yeah

4521
02:59:52,710 --> 02:59:55,409
I don't even walk into a rec shop the

4522
02:59:54,239 --> 02:59:57,210
only reason I go to a shop is to get

4523
02:59:55,409 --> 02:59:59,100
some edibles all right I got a monkey

4524

4535
03:00:21,209 --> 03:00:33,568

4536
03:00:26,158 --> 03:00:35,850

4537
03:00:33,568 --> 03:00:37,590
members half price if you're a medical

4538
03:00:35,850 --> 03:00:39,090
but we're not really doing Elsa's right

4539
03:00:37,590 --> 03:00:41,579
now on medical because we're trying to

4540
03:00:39,090 --> 03:00:44,850
make sure every patient has so meds cool

4541
03:00:41,579 --> 03:00:47,579
like we're cool you know good recreation

4542
03:00:44,850 --> 03:00:49,529
good half though like getting sick and a

4543
03:00:47,579 --> 03:00:51,209
half but we're trying to make sure we

4544
03:00:49,529 --> 03:00:52,408
keep product on our shelves for

4545
03:00:51,209 --> 03:00:53,969
everybody and we're not like some of

4546
03:00:52,408 --> 03:01:02,389
these other dispensaries that don't have

4547
03:00:53,969 --> 03:01:06,179
anything so there are a lot of other

4548
03:01:02,389 --> 03:01:07,858
stuff questions on there one that I want

4549
03:01:06,180 --> 03:01:10,408
to go over that I just discovered seed

4550
03:01:07,859 --> 03:01:12,359
to sale tracking how does it work this

4551
03:01:10,408 --> 03:01:14,068
could be long in December the state

4552
03:01:12,359 --> 03:01:16,710
rolled out its 1.2 million

4553
03:01:14,068 --> 03:01:19,559
excuse me 1.2 million dollar marijuana

4554
03:01:16,709 --> 03:01:22,198
tracking system called MIT s for unn

4555
03:01:19,559 --> 03:01:25,109
creatively marijuana inventory tracking

4556
03:01:22,199 --> 03:01:27,210
solution it works a little like this

4557
03:01:25,109 --> 03:01:28,800
every plant that a commercial growers

4558
03:01:27,209 --> 03:01:31,589
start sticks in dirt gets a

4559
03:01:28,799 --> 03:01:32,698
radiofrequency tag an RF tag that moves

4560
03:01:31,590 --> 03:01:34,109
with the plant through its lifecycle

4561
03:01:32,699 --> 03:01:35,699
once the marijuana is harvested

4562
03:01:34,109 --> 03:01:38,100
everything is weighed then its weight

4563
03:01:35,699 --> 03:01:40,529
again after drying out and at other

4564
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:42,270
points during processing until it's all

4565
03:01:40,529 --> 03:01:44,369
packaged up to leave the grow so

4566
03:01:42,270 --> 03:01:46,470
basically uh when if you work there in

4567
03:01:44,369 --> 03:01:48,630
your trimming you make three piles you

4568
03:01:46,469 --> 03:01:50,519
have buds you have trim and then you

4569
03:01:48,629 --> 03:01:52,379
have trash and you get a plant you cut

4570
03:01:50,520 --> 03:01:54,329
it down you do your harvest and all of

4571
03:01:52,379 --> 03:01:56,099
your stuff has to weigh what it weighed

4572
03:01:54,329 --> 03:01:57,539
when you originally cut it down you have

4573
03:01:56,100 --> 03:01:58,829
to have enough buds enough trim and

4574
03:01:57,540 --> 03:02:00,449
enough sticks to equal the weight of the

4575
03:01:58,829 --> 03:02:02,488
original plant or they think you just

4576
03:02:00,449 --> 03:02:06,000
stole some [ __ ] or it's missing and it

4577
03:02:02,488 --> 03:02:07,680
needs to be accounted for so it's it's

4578
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:09,389
weighed several times then the packages

4579
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:10,450
shipped to stores the stores can't weigh

4580
03:02:09,389 --> 03:02:12,760
more than a pound

4581
03:02:10,450 --> 03:02:14,290
and they get their own RFID tags at the

4582
03:02:12,760 --> 03:02:16,059
shop store owners are required to weigh

4583
03:02:14,290 --> 03:02:18,600
their inventory every day all of the

4584
03:02:16,059 --> 03:02:20,769
data is entered into the MIT s the mints

4585
03:02:18,600 --> 03:02:22,390
stores are also required to have some

4586
03:02:20,770 --> 03:02:24,790
type of point-of-sale tracking system to

4587
03:02:22,389 --> 03:02:26,109
charge sales in theory every purchase at

4588
03:02:24,790 --> 03:02:28,689
point-of-sale system should have a

4589
03:02:26,110 --> 03:02:30,610
corresponding drop in inventory in the

4590
03:02:28,689 --> 03:02:32,979
marijuana tracking system it's up to the

4591
03:02:30,610 --> 03:02:34,600
state's pot auditors to actually scour

4592
03:02:32,978 --> 03:02:38,438
the books and make sure it all matches

4593
03:02:34,600 --> 03:02:40,140
up I need to drink hold on let's make my

4594
03:02:38,439 --> 03:02:46,180
height which I need her to drink so bad

4595
03:02:40,139 --> 03:02:48,069
that's bad that's uh that's dry that's a

4596
03:02:46,180 --> 03:02:50,530
little too dry need some clear throat

4597
03:02:48,069 --> 03:02:52,600
all right clear eyes it's clear throat

4598
03:02:50,530 --> 03:02:55,090
all right so the tracking system does

4599
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:57,130
not have limits though which is why

4600
03:02:55,090 --> 03:02:59,110
officials say is it just an it's just an

4601
03:02:57,129 --> 03:03:00,789
enforcement tool not a whole regime and

4602
03:02:59,110 --> 03:03:03,130
embarrassingly for the state holiday

4603
03:03:00,790 --> 03:03:04,540
shipping delays mean not all plants in

4604
03:03:03,129 --> 03:03:07,269
the commercial system were entered into

4605
03:03:04,540 --> 03:03:08,740
the mitts by January 1st that was kind

4606
03:03:07,270 --> 03:03:10,300
of funny January 1st they're like this

4607
03:03:08,739 --> 03:03:12,219
is all required this is all required

4608
03:03:10,299 --> 03:03:13,959
I was watching dispensary owners sit

4609
03:03:12,219 --> 03:03:15,849
there going well unless UPS comes today

4610
03:03:13,959 --> 03:03:19,509
that [ __ ] ain't happening it's kind of

4611
03:03:15,850 --> 03:03:20,800
funny so there's a lot of stuff I don't

4612
03:03:19,510 --> 03:03:22,510
want to read I want to open my own

4613
03:03:20,799 --> 03:03:24,069
marijuana store where do I start

4614
03:03:22,510 --> 03:03:26,739
I'm not even gonna get into that one

4615
03:03:24,069 --> 03:03:28,209

4617
03:03:28,209 --> 03:03:33,179

4618
03:03:29,860 --> 03:03:35,319
gonna move on to the next topic here I

4619
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:41,470
mentioned at the start of the show that

4620
03:03:35,319 --> 03:03:44,079
we defeated a Senate bill 177 in 178 I

4621
03:03:41,469 --> 03:03:45,579
tweeted a lot I didn't know I didn't do

4622
03:03:44,079 --> 03:03:47,350
as much as I could but a lot of people

4623
03:03:45,579 --> 03:03:48,760
sent emails a lot of people rallied we

4624
03:03:47,350 --> 03:03:51,610
had a lot of support that's really cool

4625
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:55,569
proud of us for that we needed to knock

4626
03:03:51,610 --> 03:03:57,040
that down so now there's a new one we

4627
03:03:55,569 --> 03:03:59,228
are looking for volunteers to send a few

4628
03:03:57,040 --> 03:04:04,150
emails urging members of the Senate to

4629
03:03:59,228 --> 03:04:06,579
vote YES vote YES on Senate bill 218 218

4630
03:04:04,149 --> 03:04:10,090
with its passage Colorado can visite

4631
03:04:06,579 --> 03:04:12,219
begin the process of lifting up those

4632
03:04:10,090 --> 03:04:14,260
that have been so adversely affected by

4633
03:04:12,219 --> 03:04:16,179
the collateral punishment associated

4634
03:04:14,260 --> 03:04:19,090
with criminal criminal convictions of

4635
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:20,620

fun episode we've talked about some

4664
03:05:23,530 --> 03:05:29,471
really interesting things which I always

4665
03:05:26,530 --> 03:05:31,329
like those better at podcasting I feel

4666
03:05:29,470 --> 03:05:33,069
like to hear getting comfortable some of

4667
03:05:31,329 --> 03:05:35,140
the news so I don't always get a chance

4668
03:05:33,069 --> 03:05:36,879
to read it this is kind of my news

4669
03:05:35,140 --> 03:05:38,079
update yeah it's really nice I hope

4670
03:05:36,879 --> 03:05:40,089
someone's hanging out in the grow room

4671
03:05:38,079 --> 03:05:42,399
or driving in the car or stuck at work

4672
03:05:40,090 --> 03:05:44,229
or commuting and I hoped I'm educating

4673
03:05:42,399 --> 03:05:46,300
them and you actually dude if you get

4674
03:05:44,229 --> 03:05:48,369
the topics ahead of time they want to

4675
03:05:46,300 --> 03:05:51,129
text them to me or something I can start

4676
03:05:48,370 --> 03:05:52,721
researching some of it and maybe find

4677
03:05:51,129 --> 03:05:55,119
something else so there you go some

4678
03:05:52,720 --> 03:05:57,189
branches on the same topic yeah well

4679
03:05:55,120 --> 03:05:58,511
sometimes uh sometimes I find him out as

4680
03:05:57,190 --> 03:06:01,000

4681
03:05:58,511 --> 03:06:04,021
what I mean if they if you do think

4682
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:06,250
about them early shoot me a text that's

4683
03:06:04,021 --> 03:06:08,200
one thing about my show I've realized is

4684
03:06:06,250 --> 03:06:10,390
I've got my episodes out quickly because

4685
03:06:08,200 --> 03:06:13,079
it becomes from irrelevant quite yeah

4686
03:06:10,390 --> 03:06:15,129
yeah we we're a pretty topical show so

4687
03:06:13,079 --> 03:06:16,690

the sativa mix I'm not sure I put some

4713
03:07:12,440 --> 03:07:19,420
in the to-go container containers and I

4714
03:07:15,640 --> 03:07:23,029
is it the harder one or the softer one

4715

4721
03:07:34,250 --> 03:07:41,799
the citrusy sativa plants tend to

4722
03:07:37,250 --> 03:07:41,799
shatter up a lot more than the

4723
03:07:41,989 --> 03:07:47,000

4807
03:11:10,229 --> 03:11:14,549
give big huge thanks to Jorge Cervantes

4808
03:11:11,909 --> 03:11:16,020
I got to meet Jorge one time oh no I

4809
03:11:14,549 --> 03:11:17,459
caught him off guard there was a big

4810
03:11:16,020 --> 03:11:19,079
line of people and he was answering

4811
03:11:17,459 --> 03:11:21,869
questions he would answer one question

4812
03:11:19,079 --> 03:11:23,430
for you personally and everybody's

4813
03:11:21,870 --> 03:11:25,079
questions were like my clones are doing

4814
03:11:23,430 --> 03:11:27,210
this or my plants doing this or how do I

4815
03:11:25,079 --> 03:11:30,649
do this and I've read his book dude and

4816
03:11:27,209 --> 03:11:32,819
I've been growing for a little bit so I

4817
03:11:30,649 --> 03:11:34,500
walked up to him and I said hey Jorge

4818
03:11:32,819 --> 03:11:36,420
what kind of music do you like to listen

4819
03:11:34,500 --> 03:11:38,010
to when you're in the garden and you

4820
03:11:36,420 --> 03:11:39,960
know he was on autopilot he was signing

4821
03:11:38,010 --> 03:11:41,909
books and just spouting out add nitrogen

4822
03:11:39,959 --> 03:11:43,289
add nitrogen or whatever you know what I

4823
03:11:41,909 --> 03:11:45,329
mean and I said what kind of music do

4824
03:11:43,290 --> 03:11:47,400
you listen to and he closed my book and

4825
03:11:45,329 --> 03:11:48,780
he put his pen down I said well that's a

4826
03:11:47,399 --> 03:11:50,579
really good question and he had to think

4827
03:11:48,780 --> 03:11:52,950
about it for a minute and so I felt like

4828
03:11:50,579 --> 03:11:54,719
I kind of had all those other people had

4829
03:11:52,950 --> 03:11:56,610
a moment with Jorge but Jorge had a

4830
03:11:54,719 --> 03:11:58,590
moment with me shared that he was like

4831
03:11:56,610 --> 03:12:00,180
oh man you read the book you don't have

4832
03:11:58,590 --> 03:12:02,670
to ask me a weed question you want to

4833
03:12:00,180 --> 03:12:03,809
know about Jorge Cervantes so I said

4834
03:12:02,670 --> 03:12:04,469
what kind of music do you listen to in

4835
03:12:03,809 --> 03:12:07,289
your garden

4836
03:12:04,469 --> 03:12:10,469
and his answer was the Beatles Led

4837
03:12:07,290 --> 03:12:12,239
Zeppelin and Shakira and he said

4838
03:12:10,469 --> 03:12:15,000
Shekinah he didn't say Shakira he said

4839
03:12:12,238 --> 03:12:17,818
