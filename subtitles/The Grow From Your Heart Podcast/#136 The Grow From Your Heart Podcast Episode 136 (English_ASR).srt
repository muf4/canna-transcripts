175
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,049
press out some solvent list some fresh

176

frozen solvent yeah nice and then I

177
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,939
rolled it out again i heated up a car of

178
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,559
cap and rolled it out

179
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:35,299
there's no operating moving vehicles at

over and slept in a parking lot I may

182
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,810
have been homeless at the time but I was

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,769
tacos I think the place is called

428
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:11,720
coquettes and Colorado Springs shout-out

429
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:13,369
to the vegan tacos or the burrowing owl

if you want some good vegan food yeah

431
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:17,409
I've been with you trying to order food

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,110
it's

433
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,269
the Coquette served like tofu it was all

434
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:26,740
your normal taco fixings but then tofu

435
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:30,160
that had been season 2 done well

436
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,160
thinking mushrooms

437
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:37,120
that's what the [ __ ] mellow mushroom

438
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:40,250
they replace all meat with that place

439
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,109
so fire dude that was that was probably

440
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,309
the best pizza I mean every wasn't cheap

441
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:45,309
for my standards but

442
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,930
everybody at the table didn't go yeah

443
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,609
it's not a mile away from the sacred

00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:58,519
that I could remember the [ __ ] name

446
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:00,169
of it because it's pointless to just

447
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,059
talk about it not know the name but it's

448
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,560
basically the size of the pizza joint is

449
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,690
the size of this whole recording area

450
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,089

564
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:37,159
podcasts have been happening in two

565
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:37,158
takes I do about 15 to 20 minutes

566
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:42,319
take a drink dunno by myself it's hard

567
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,388
to talk you're only said one person I

568
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:48,450
think this will probably be in the 130s

569
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:50,339
the mid 131 34 is up this actually in

570
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:54,298
the recording this is labeled 135 I'm

571
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:55,738
not sure goes 135 or 136 I'm um 52 weeks

572
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:58,048
out of the year doing one a week that's

573
00:25:55,739 --> 00:26:00,179
yeah that's impressive yeah you got a

574
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:02,819
facebook memory the other day it was uh

575
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:05,399
just recorded my first podcast or so

576
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:07,009
nice right yeah that'd be about two

577
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:09,538
years ago

578
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:12,329
this shows my shows a little over two

579
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:13,618
years yeah yeah nice all over I was in

580
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:15,898
the middle of April I think was two

581
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:18,178
years around cannabis cup time mhm or

582
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:20,368
not cannabis cup time right before it or

583
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,730
something yeah I think so because we you

584
00:26:20,368 --> 00:26:22,569
hit

585
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,150
[Music]

586
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:26,559
episode 50 right around cannabis cup

587
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,509
time I believe because that would be

588
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,980
about a year Yeah right you know

589
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:31,230
sometimes that would do two episodes a

590
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,519
week

591
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,660
it's hard it's hard to have that much

592
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,660

593
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,849

thing you couldn't yeah you pretty much

1015
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:10,458
could was it around on the retail end

1016
00:48:08,748 --> 00:48:11,718
because I think they use MMJ menu on the

1017
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:13,188
retail end so they could do that the

1018
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:16,389
retail worked fine but any of the grow

1019

we had we were packaging a transfer and

1020
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:21,108
a large transfer like we're in the

1025
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,318
couple hours to put all these packages

1026
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,789
together so we put all the packages

1027
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:33,079
together there weighed their bags we got

1028
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:34,519
the marker written on and when we go to

00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:49,159
but it came back up the next day and

1034
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:50,749
it's like we've had our yeah had our

1035
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:53,328
buds have been working or we've been

1036
00:48:50,748 --> 00:48:55,368
working our buds off to get things back

1037
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:56,660
smoking again or something like that and

1038

they tried to be cute about it and they

1039
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:01,389
apologized but they definitely tried to

1040
00:48:58,338 --> 00:49:05,679
be witty you guys get that wrote from a

the day I know you're busy guy now but

1374
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:47,880
is there are you still doing genetics

1375
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,809
definitely why just I didn't know if you

1376
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,150
wanted to

1377
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:54,029
oh well I don't have anything available

1378
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:57,240
at the time but I'm making a rise f2s

1379
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:58,290
okay which I'll be on my testers bust

1380
01:06:57,239 --> 01:06:59,669
through a bunch of those and then I may

1381
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:01,769
put some of those out to the public I

1382
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:03,360
definitely like a rise a lot it's it's

1383
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:05,759
dream we had a really good cut of it

1384
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,110
yeah it was like our number three year

1385
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,220
number five or something like I know I

1386
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,220
rise number one

1387
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:18,929
I think it was number one that we kept

1388
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:20,760
around for a long time so some of the

1389
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:23,190
early stuff you had got an amazing boy

1390
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,900
of that that cross and then I've got

1391
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,670
girls of that and then I'm gonna put it

1392
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,289
like

1393
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:31,230
several females in a room probably like

1394
01:07:28,289 --> 01:07:33,029
somewhere between 16 and 20 girls and

1395
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:35,219
that arise male in a room two of the

1396
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:36,780
arise the same male the two clones of it

1397
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:38,250
the same room and grow about and [ __ ]

1398
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:40,830
hit that pollen on all those plants and

1399
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:43,099
make like between 15 and 20 new crosses

1400
01:07:40,829 --> 01:07:45,509
and test them all out works

1401
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:47,659
now that I think about that arrays

1402
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:51,300
number one that we had

1403
01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:53,809
it's that your male is the male

1404
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:56,760
counterpart to that phenotype nice

1405
01:07:53,809 --> 01:07:58,119
just big tall amazing by that's crazy

1406
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:07,370
projection

1407
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:10,829
[Music]

1408
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:13,049
the first time we ran that actually that

1409
01:08:10,829 --> 01:08:15,659
was two years ago we also had the black

1410
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:17,310
cherry Kim last year when I've read

1411
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:19,279
arise I really expected it to take

1412
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:21,390
longer to finish flowering but I get

1413
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:25,068
seven and a half to eight to nine week

1414
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:25,069
phenotype that stuff it's like

1415
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:33,810
yeah you would think

1416
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,039
golden go on appearances I think a lot

1417
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,720
of growers if they didn't know what it

1418
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,519
was but think it was a longer flowering

1419
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,230
strain than it really is that trait

1420
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,660
actually comes from the Romulan in it

1421
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:44,309
because from Canada those guys brother

1422
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:46,139
[ __ ] to finish a little earlier they

1423
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:47,940
found the earlier finishing sativas and

1424
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,829
went for that aspect that's like we were

1425
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:54,139
talking to Christian the other day on

1426

1545
01:14:34,939 --> 01:14:38,479

I'm gonna do another run after it with

1556
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:08,229
the exact same thing but I'm gonna add

1557
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:11,389
T's to it once a week okay and just see

1558
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:12,800
final product yeah yeah we're doing a

1559
01:15:11,389 --> 01:15:14,840
side-by-side comparison with two

1560
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,570
different nutrient brands right now

1561
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:19,038
oh now you're [ __ ] out touch it now

1562
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:20,808

1563
01:15:19,038 --> 01:15:22,038

1565
01:15:22,038 --> 01:15:24,340
me now

1566
01:15:25,899 --> 01:15:30,349
so we're running and we're gonna retire

1567
01:15:29,059 --> 01:15:31,668
one brand so I think I could talk about

1568
01:15:30,349 --> 01:15:32,809
it I don't know I'm not sure what I'm

1569
01:15:31,668 --> 01:15:34,069
allowed to talk about really because

1570
01:15:32,809 --> 01:15:35,630
some of its confidential but we're

1571
01:15:34,069 --> 01:15:38,148
testing I've talked about it on Facebook

1572
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:40,248
we've got veg blue in one tank and we're

1573
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:42,229
on week one like three or what's today

1574
01:15:40,248 --> 01:15:44,269
Thursday so we're four days in the

1575
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:46,010
plants look [ __ ] happy it's like but

1576
01:15:44,269 --> 01:15:47,149
I mean we're in Cocoa so I'm sure I

1577
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:49,248
would see something by now if they were

1578
01:15:47,149 --> 01:15:51,079
not happy and they get fed they're on a

1579
01:15:49,248 --> 01:15:52,069
cycle so they get fed multiple times a

1580
01:15:51,078 --> 01:15:53,448
day so they're getting plenty of

1581
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:55,868
opportunity to show me if they're happy

1582
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:59,388
or not yeah they look really really good

1583
01:15:55,868 --> 01:16:02,268
I've always been intrigued by the I mean

1584
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:04,489
I'm an organic grower also because of

1585
01:16:02,269 --> 01:16:06,649
the simplicity right but so I've always

1586
01:16:04,488 --> 01:16:08,208
been intrigued by the simplicity of veg

1587
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:10,070
boom it's all they send you like for

1588
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:13,090
powders and one liquid didn't weigh them

1589
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:15,648
out by the gram like there's so much per

1590
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:18,050
gallon so many grams per gallon you just

1591
01:16:15,649 --> 01:16:19,489
weigh it out on a scale and I just pour

1592
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:21,199
it in there and stir it real real well

1593
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:23,478
and just let it go I just let the

1594
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:25,158
reservoirs I put huge pumps in the rest

1595
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:28,030
of it [ __ ] spin real well the water

1596
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:30,438
cycling in the RO water

1597
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:33,050
unfortunately it's hard to produce that

1598
01:16:30,439 --> 01:16:35,559
much RO water can i and I feel you a

1599
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:40,248
little secret there let's hear it buddy

1600
01:16:35,559 --> 01:16:41,570
walmart has RO water for a dollar fifty

1601
01:16:40,248 --> 01:16:43,969
nine a gallon and if you go in there and

1602
01:16:41,569 --> 01:16:47,438
fill up water or like like gallon

1603
01:16:43,969 --> 01:16:51,130

1604
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:51,130
well I'm just saying like

1605
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:56,590
you know I'm not trying to piss Walmart

1606
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,589
but they have

1607
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:02,648
well yeah I mean if you're doing it

1608
01:17:00,578 --> 01:17:04,828
yours alright you know I use a thousand

1609
01:17:02,649 --> 01:17:06,760
cups of water a second for the listeners

1610
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:09,279
thousand gallons of water every other

1611
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,689
day then we're in the same [ __ ]

1612
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:15,179
budget plan with them have them just

1613
01:17:10,689 --> 01:17:15,179
backed the truck in and we use water bro

1614
01:17:16,408 --> 01:17:22,418
actually veg will actually sent us a mix

1615
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:23,769
they sent us a two-part mix that I use

1616
01:17:22,418 --> 01:17:26,078
half one and half the other and it

1617
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:28,479
balances the pH and adjust for my I've

1618
01:17:26,078 --> 01:17:32,639
tested them some water tests they sent

1619
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:32,639
us a formula for design for our water

1620
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:40,658
the tank was getting about halfway down

1621
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:42,369
so I just do the hose in there and

1622
01:17:40,658 --> 01:17:44,799
filled it up with water and leather so

1623
01:17:42,368 --> 01:17:48,509
it totally six five yeah all the way to

1624
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,510
the top and it's still at 6.50

1625
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:55,539
[Music]

1626
01:17:52,349 --> 01:17:59,189
organics great but I mean yeah it took

1627
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:59,188
