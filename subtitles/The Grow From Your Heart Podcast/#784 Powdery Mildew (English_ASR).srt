that I bet you didn't even listen to go

you will learn a lot it also goes on to

142
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,620
say it's also nice to see that your

143
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,918
opinions and methods have changed over

144
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,019
the years which means we are learning uh

145
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,240
yeah yes absolutely I wanted to talk

146
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,000
about that briefly here my opinions my

147
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,040
methods my Approach my understanding has

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,418
changed so much over the past few years

149
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,160
since I started this show I'm probably

150
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:18,478
coming up on I don't know if it's seven

151
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,020
or eight years since I've started this

152
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,519
podcast 785 episodes so that's at least

153
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,680
five six maybe seven years I've been

154
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,599
doing this show if I haven't changed my

155
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,759
ideas my methods my Approach my

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,100
techniques my understanding that I was

157
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,500
not doing anything right at all I was

158
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,860
standing still so I've learned so much

159
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,019
I've gone from being a a small closet

160
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,960
grower to a tent grower to a basement

161

cultivator to a commercial cultivation

165
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,240
consultant I've gone a long way in my

166
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,800
cultivation career there was a lot of c

167
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
word letters in that sentence it was

168
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,819
really hard not to stumble over all that

169
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,978
but I've been in this cultivation game

170
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,779
for so long that if my methods

171
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:05,819
techniques and ideas didn't change over

172
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,319
all of those drastic shifts I would have

173
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,538
not gotten anywhere I had to learn on

174
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,639
the fly when I went from a tent from a

175
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,079
closet grow to a tent grow is a totally

176
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,060
different environment totally different

177
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,279
ball game everything was different the

178
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,379
airflow was completely different when I

179
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,119
went from the tent to the basement grow

180
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,159
or the one room in the basement grow

181
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,300
that was a full-on different ball game

182
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,680
than when I opened up the entire

183
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,600
basement and put the grow in there that

184
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,978
was a fully different ball game then we

185
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,419
started building trap houses and

186
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:31,918
flooding those with plants and lights

187
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:34,198
and that was a totally different

188
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,459
situation trying to deduct the heat from

189
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,259
one room to another because the other

190
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,299
room was getting too cold and I learned

191
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,800
so many things just by doing it trial by

192
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,960
fire is kind of how I say it happened

193
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,478
then I got thrown into the commercial

194
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,879
growing environment that was such a huge

195
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,620
learning curve when I jumped into that I

196
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,120
was doing I was hand mixing bottled

197
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,500
nutrients in a little cup and just hand

198
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,199
watering plants and then it was time to

199
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,699
go into the big boy grow and mix up 300

200
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,020
gallon reservoirs and make sure I'm

201
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,340
getting that [ __ ] right and document

202
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:01,019
everything thing and then water every

203
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:02,698
plant properly it went from hand

204
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,620
watering every plant myself to having

205
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,478
machines where I could push a button and

206
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,579
500 plants would get water all at once

207
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,740
and it was amazing but it was such a

208
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,258
learning curve if I did everything the

209
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,240
same now that I did uh back in the day

210
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,000
in my first couple of grows it would not

211
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,740
work things would fail the

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,300
um first of all my education just from

213
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,699
doing it being around the plant I've

214
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,439
learned so much it's like almost any job

215
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,520
or art or skill that you develop the

216
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,779
more you do it you're going to get

217
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,459
better at it you're going to see things

218
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,019
if you're paying attention you're going

219
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,939
to see things and start learning the

220
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:35,579
signs and the hints and you'll be ahead

221
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,379
of I may see a Calcium deficiency before

222
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,538
most people I may see a nitrogen problem

223
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,879
before some people I may hear an

224
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,379
environmental piece of equipment go

225
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,180
wrong before some people just because

226
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,199
I've been there so much I'm not saying

227
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,759
I've been there more than you I just

228
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,439
I've been there a lot so I've got a lot

229
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,598
of experience but having done all of

230
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,219
these tasks so many times I'm very

231
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,598
comfortable and very familiar with these

232
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,340
things and I see things and start

233
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,199
learning things and I take in data very

234
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,239
quickly and I've got a good data process

235
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,098
assessing Center in my brain and I can

236
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,598
just see I get warnings a little more

237
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:04,918
quickly my check engine light will come

238
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,899
on before most people's and it'll

239
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,939
identify a problem before most people

240
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,859
I'll see that Calcium deficiency maybe

241
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:13,079
maybe before the other grower I may see

242
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,699
that nitrogen deficiency I may notice an

243
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,500
environmental Factor went wrong some

244
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,660
machine broke down just being in the

245
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,699
growth so long has made it so easy for

246
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,220
me to identify things but what I had to

247
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,720
do quickly was adjust to new equipment

248
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,580
when I got into the commercial grow

249
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,199
everything was bigger everything was

250
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:31,198
industrial grade I'm not buying things

251
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,180
for uh just a whole bunch of small

252
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,680
Walmart dehumidifiers like we used to do

253
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,139
in the tent grow I have to go buy big

254
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,838
quests and Danby dehumidifiers it's a

255
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,158
big 30 to our three ton 30 ton air

256
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,860
conditioners now it's a big difference

257
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,259
than it used to be running the 12 000

258
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,060
BTU air conditioner in the basement so

259
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,679
so many things have changed so

260
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:51,479
everything has changed the plants have

261
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,939
changed I have changed the technology

262
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,500
has changed uh the technology has come

263
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,240
so far the lighting is way different

264
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,458
when I was first doing this everybody

265
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,100
was running HP s lights everybody was

266
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,539
using big gigantic fixtures now we've

267
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,060
all got a bunch of little tiny LED

268
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,740
lights back in the day was so much air

269
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,179
conditioning had to be used now that the

270
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,659
lights are better we don't have to use

271
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,219
so much air conditioning the skills the

272
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,778
growing the plants have come a long way

273
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,480
we've got better plants we've got better

274
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:20,159
plants available to us we've got better

275
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,159
nutrients we've got better technology

276
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,379
we've got access to so much information

277
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:28,439
with legalization now I can Google so

278
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,939
much stuff before people in non-legal

279
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,380
States would be afraid just to Google

280
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,420
how to grow their plants because they

281
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:34,679
may get in trouble for that somehow they

282
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,879
didn't know how but they knew it was

283
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,979
possible maybe they'll get in trouble

284
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,259
just for their damn Google search so

285
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,700
technology has brought us a long way I

286
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:43,200
have come a long way if you guys are

287
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,200
still trying to grow the way that you

288
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,080
grew two three five years ago

289
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,000
you've got to adjust and adapt learn a

290
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,860
few more things maybe find some new

291
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,080
equipment don't be the dinosaur don't be

292
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,419
stuck in the old technology I do believe

293
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,040
if it ain't broke don't fix it but if we

294
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,019
don't try new things how do we improve

295
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,539
how do we get better don't be afraid to

296
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,980
take some risks and try new things every

297
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,019
artist that you've ever heard about

298
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,519
every musician every filmmaker everybody

299
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,679
that's been successful that you have

300
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,778
heard of has taken a major risk in their

301
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,159
career and had faith in their skills

302
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,139
that they were going to do it so have

303
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,338
faith in yourself in the grow don't keep

304
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,559
doing the same [ __ ] you've been doing

305
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,420
for the past five years it's a new year

306
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,639
this episode is going to come out right

307
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,079
around the second week of January start

308
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,220
this New Year by learning some new

309
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,200
skills we said we were going to learn

310
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,879
some new [ __ ] take a risk what's the

311
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,700
risk you're going to take this year in

312
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,500
your grow to learn and improve so don't

313
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,940
be afraid to learn some [ __ ] I have come

314
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,860
a long way if you listen to the old

315
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,779
episodes and you hear that I was doing

316
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,519
this and mixing this way and watering

317
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,980
this way and doing this and I say

318
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,480
something different now don't say ooh he

319
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,039
changed he said something different say

320
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,720
oh that guy involved and he's doing

321
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,458
things differently because in his

322
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,019
experience his research he's noticed

323
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,699
maybe there was a better way and he's

324
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,860
trying something different and I try to

325
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,420
share that with you guys I know a lot of

326
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,639
people really follow my guidance my

327
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,078
advice you buy the products I recommend

328
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,778
I appreciate that that's why I don't go

329
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,639
recommending a lot of products because

330
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:07,980
um it's you can grow with a lot of great

331
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,259
things but I like some specific [ __ ]

332
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,360
find what works really well for you and

333
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:14,578
don't be afraid to switch it up and try

334
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,220
a new [ __ ] all right um there has been a

335
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:19,500
big evolution in me as a person in the

336
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,899
grow in my business and in the podcast

337
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,778
and thank you for noticing my friend

338
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,458
Zachary Johnson now I did say that this

339
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,559
episode was going to be about powdery

340
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,539
mildew I've gotten several messages and

341
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,518
emails about powdery mildew somebody

342
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,799
even brought it up on my Instagram live

343
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,839
show recently they say how can I get

344
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,278
this powdery mildew off of the buds will

345
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,920
spraying it get rid of the powdery

346
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:43,500
mildew what can I do the quick answer is

347
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,539
yes you can spray some products on your

348
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,458
plants to get rid of the powdery mildew

349
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,259
it will not look like it's there it will

350
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,699
wash it off your clients customers

351
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,439
whoever will never know that it was

352
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,379
there you can even do a bud wash at the

353
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,300
end make it super clean but guess what

354
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:59,820
if you don't correct the entire room the

355
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,919
entire situation that powdery mildew

356
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,440
will keep coming back there's something

357
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,479
more than just powdery mildew causing

358
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,040
the powdery mildew that is a a symptom

359
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,139
that is a sign that there's a problem

360
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,599
something is wrong in the room and is

361
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,699
being shown to you by powdery mildew it

362
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,800
is probably an airflow problem it's

363
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,440
probably a moisture problem it comes

364
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,838
down to most likely a VPD problem that

365
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,700
is a vapor pressure deficit problem that

366
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,140
is a math equation evolving your

367
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,820
temperature and humidity if you don't

368
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,139
understand that it's not too important

369
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,480
we will stick with temperature and

370
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,699
humidity a lot of times when the lights

371
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,100
go off in the grow space the humidity

372
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,500
spikes often times when the lights come

373
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,060
on in the grow space the humidity spikes

374
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,919
those spikes you're getting a high

375
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,419
humidity point in the room the plants

376
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,919
are not prepared for that your

377
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,659
ventilation equipment is not prepared

378
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,059
for that you're getting a big spike in

379
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,278
there that that is oftentimes what

380
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,259
triggers the powdery mildew so one thing

381
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:54,240
I would recommend is correcting the

382
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:55,980
spikes that happen when the lights come

383
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,480
on and when the lights go off I mean

384
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,060
temperature spikes because it's been

385
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,620
whatever degrees in the room and now the

386
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:03,299
light either goes off or comes on it's

387
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,519
going to change probably somewhere

388
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:07,620
between 7 and 12 degrees quite quickly

389
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,839
in that room the temperature is going to

390
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,399
spike or drop if the lights going off or

391
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,500
on and that's going to affect the

392
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,059
humidity tremendously depending on the

393
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,679
size of the room how many plants you've

394
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,539
got in there that will affect the

395
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,859
humidity really strongly I would

396
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,958
recommend getting some sort of a

397
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,480
monitoring system that will real time

398
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,219
monitor the relative humidity the

399
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,620
temperature and even possibly do the

400
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,959
equation and monitor the vapor pressure

401
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,360
deficit in your grow space at all times

402
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,278
then look at the chart after two or

403
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,139
three days of cycling on and off and see

404
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,360
what's happening it lights on and lights

405
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,879
off see how those spikes are going then

406
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,278
let's figure out if we can set up some

407
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,559
sort of airflow system is there an

408
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,360
exhaust vent or an exhaust fan or blower

409
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,879
that we can turn off or on at the

410
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,740
correct times to correct this spike in

411
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,838
humidity maybe it's a drop in humidity

412
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,639
depends on what's going on in your room

413
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,040
also it greatly depends on what's going

414
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,778
on in the adjacent rooms if you're if

415
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,399
your grow is up against the outside so

416
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,139
this wall right here is an exterior wall

417
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,759
if it grows up against that and it's

418
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,259
snowy outside you got different

419
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,419
opportunities for different climate

420
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,519
changes when that light goes off if it's

421
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:12,958
uh that's uh that's honestly a bathroom

422
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,578
on the other side of that wall so if the

423
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,500
Grove is in there it wouldn't be as

424
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:17,638
drastic of a change when the lights go

425
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,860
off because this room is temperature

426
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,680
controlled so that's also going to play

427
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,680
into some of your humidity and

428
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,120
temperature and uh VPD swings in your

429
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,679
light change another thing to think

430
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,480
about is something I kind of mentioned a

431
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,399
moment ago when the lights go off and

432
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,560
when the lights go on how drastic is

433
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,120
that temperature swing a moment ago I

434
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,458
did mention the temperature change when

435
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,198
the lights go off and on I did say that

436
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,359
it would be somewhere between 7 and 12

437
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,399
degrees I wouldn't like to do much more

438
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,899
than that when the lights go off or go

439
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,539
on I like to keep that daytime at night

440
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,179
time temperature is close to the same as

441
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,039
I can as possible but no more than 10 to

442
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,198
12 degrees in difference between your

443
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,698
day and night temperature if it's 87

444
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,299
degrees in there with the lights on and

445
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:03,120
it gets lower than 77 maybe like 75 74

446
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,919
73 that big temperature swing does give

447
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,259
you the opportunity to get powdery

448
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,939
mildew in that room the main things I

449
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,278
would think about is keeping the air

450
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,139
moving in the room don't let stagnant

451
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,939
air stay in the room exhaust and replace

452
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,680
that air in the room do you have an

453
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,839
exhaust fan removing the stagnant

454
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,879
humidity out of the room do you have

455
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,980
passive intakes do you have active

456
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,078
intakes bringing fresh air into that

457
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,420
room somehow I like to bring fresh air

458
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,399
in low and suck that old hot humid air

459
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,319
out at the top are you doing something

460
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,480
like that to replace replenish and

461
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,100
recycle that air you don't want that old

462
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,740
air in the room all the time we need

463
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,139
fresh air so let's have old Air going

464
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,180
out new air coming in let's keep plenty

465
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,360
of fresh air moving around then let's

466
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:47,519
avoid micro climates in a big grow you

467
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,379
may have fans every three to six feet or

468
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,578
something like that but there's so let's

469
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:51,778
say that there's a light right there

470
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:52,859
there really is a light right there we

471
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:54,120
don't have to pretend you could see it

472
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,278
reflecting off my hand there's a light

473
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,320
right there also they're about two or

474
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,600
three feet away from my hands let's say

475
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,760
that maybe right here where the iPad is

476
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,259
that might not get enough airflow

477
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,458
because there may be a plant here and a

478
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,319
plant here in a plant here in a plant

479
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,578
here and all around and hear a plant and

480
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,440
they're a plant everywhere a plant plant

481
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:12,659
but guess what right here by the iPod

482
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,519
maybe over here by the microphone just

483
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:16,078
maybe might not get enough airflow

484
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,879
because the canopy is built up so

485
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,039
densely you're going to create micro

486
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,299
climates and here is going to be a

487
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,799
completely different climate than over

488
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:24,359
there by the lights and up here by the

489
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,159
top of the canopy and over here and over

490
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,659
here this is going to be it's all it

491
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,600
might be slightly different everywhere

492
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:32,458
so have a good movement of air maybe put

493
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,680
a fan on the floor blowing the air back

494
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,719
up maybe get a Howitzer fan and hang it

495
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,099
from the ceiling what that fan does

496
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,379
instead of blowing the air left and

497
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,060
right it sucks the air up so the air

498
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,100
that is down low it pulls it up and

499
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:45,778
shoots it up to the ceiling and stirs

500
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,899
the air so if you're operating with CO2

501
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:50,698
2 the CO2 is heavier it will fall to the

502
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,379
floor the Howitzer fan will pick it up

503
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:54,659
bring it up towards your plants again

504
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,220
shoot it to the ceiling it's heavy so it

505
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:58,319
will fall again mixed with the oxygen

506
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,720
it'll keep cycling back in So if you're

507
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,519
running CO2 definitely use that Howitzer

508
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,000
fan or a fan on the floor pointing up

509
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,279
but my point is avoid micro climates we

510
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,259
want air moving around another way we

511
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,058
can prevent powdery mildew is to keep

512
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:13,619
leaves from touching each other the

513
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:15,000
plants need a little bit of space the

514
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,159
leaves can touch each other but not

515
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,720
excessively if you've got two plants

516
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,120
give them some Breathing Room think

517
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,220
about uh if I just walked up to you in a

518
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,379
room at a warm grow space and I just put

519
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,818
my hand on your shoulder all day it's

520
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,959
not that annoying but after a while it's

521
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:29,039
going to get hot it's going to get a

522
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,320
little bit sweaty it's going to get

523
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,819
uncomfortable imagine the leaves of the

524
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,678
plants just touching each other all day

525
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,359
they don't want that that also tells

526
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,798
them you shouldn't grow out any wider

527
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:39,000
you've got to grow up and get stretchy

528
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,179
because there's nowhere else for you to

529
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,500
go this way so go up so keep your plants

530
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,480
a little bit give them some growing

531
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,460
distance give them some space another

532
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,620
thing thing I'm going to recommend is

533
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,200
don't over water your plants understand

534
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:53,639
how much water to put into that room the

535
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,500
amount of water that you put into those

536
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,419
pots is how much water those plants let

537
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,919
back out into the air if you're over

538
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,660
watering they're going to let out more

539
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,640
water there's also going to be naturally

540
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,700
more water in the air so pay attention

541
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,259
to your watering and also your watering

542
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,120
schedule that could have something to do

543
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:10,679
with it I like to water if possible

544
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,359
right when the lights come on as soon as

545
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,740
they come on get them wet get them

546
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,240
watered right then that way they've got

547
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,740
all day to drink that water when the

548
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,079
lights go off they've got all night to

549
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,359
metabolize that's the most productive

550
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:22,500
way to water the plants in my opinion if

551
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,500
you're running Hydro if you're running

552
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,419
cocoa water as needed I understand we've

553
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,279
evolved so far we've changed like I said

554
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,440
a moment ago shit's different now people

555
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,240
are doing hydro and stuff also let me

556
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,640
stay focused here another thing you can

557
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,859
do is defoliate take off some of that

558
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,980
excessive leaves also so if your pot is

559
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:43,259
here maybe take off the lower six inches

560
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,819
of just leafy junk on the bottom of that

561
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:47,038
plant because that can trap a little

562
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:49,439
like I said before a micro climate that

563
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,179
lower area of the canopy all the water

564
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,679
goes into that pot the lights get warm

565
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,360
the water starts going up that area

566
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,740
right there at the bottom that's where

567
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,839
you're going to find a lot of humidity

568
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,240
you'll see a lot of powdery mildew start

569
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,980
right there in that area so you can do

570
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,660
defoliation you can do a little bit of

571
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,579
lollipopping and cleaning up the bottoms

572
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,340
of your plants that will definitely help

573
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,379
minimize the options of powdery mildew

574
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,779
but the main thing you've got to do is

575
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,760
treat the room if we don't repair treat

576
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,859
and correct the room the powdery mildew

577
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,440
will keep coming back get your exhaust

578
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,659
fan dialed in get your intake fan dialed

579
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,160
in get your airflow dialed in get all of

580
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,259
your fans in the right place get the

581
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,298
humidifier and the dehumidifier dialed

582
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,160
in so get that temperature dialed in get

583
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:31,859
your humidity dialed in get the overall

584
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,419
vapor pressure deficit dialed in in the

585
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:35,699
room then make sure that you've got

586
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,500
plenty of air movement air circulation

587
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,880
then make sure that you've got air

588
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,700
replacement make sure you've got an

589
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,740
exhaust fan removing that old Air make

590
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,419
sure you've got some sort of intake is

591
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,460
there a way for fresh air to get into

592
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,080
that that room also are you

593
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,000
supplementing with CO2 if you're

594
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,798
supplementing maybe don't get rid of all

595
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,259
that air as frequently but do keep that

596
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,179
air moving around as often as possible

597
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:59,640
then give the plants a little bit of

598
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,919
space give them some room defoliate them

599
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,080
don't over water and that should help

600
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,600
you with your powdery mildew problems

601
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,099
there are a thousand products that I

602
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:09,538
could tell you to spray on these plants

603
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,339
there are a thousand things I could tell

604
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:13,740
you to do to these plants but unless we

605
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:15,240
treat the room this powdery mildew will

606
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,339
keep coming back so the first thing

607
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,140
we've got to do is correct all of the

608
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:21,058
issues in the room maybe the first thing

609
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,980
we've got to do is identify why we are

610
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:24,599
getting the powdery mildew so we've got

611
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,400
to check that temperature the humidity

612
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,678
the VPD we've got to make sure we've got

613
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,600
circulation and air replacement then

614
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,340
let's also check on the temperature and

615
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,139
humidity changes when the lights go on

616
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:35,879
and the lights go off make sure the

617
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,679
humidity is not getting too drastic at

618
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,140
that time make sure it's not getting too

619
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,640
hot or too cold and that should help to

620
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,679
get rid of or at least to minimize

621
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,720
powdery mildew problems another thing

622
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,700
we've got to think about is strain

623
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,839
selection if you know that you're in an

624
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,400
area where you can't control the

625
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,379
humidity properly especially a

626
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,660
greenhouse or Outdoors that's when it

627
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,700
does come to selecting proper strains

628
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,160
for your environment all right that was

629
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,080
