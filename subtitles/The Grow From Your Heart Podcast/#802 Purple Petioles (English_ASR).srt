00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,619
we'll talk more about the free seeds

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,600
later in this episode I do want to

of the business we need to cover here at

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,460
the start of the podcast I do have a

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,019
bunch of great messages here right in

39
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,359
front of me let's jump into our favorite

40
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,280
portion of the show let's jump into the

41
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,799
question and answer portion of today's

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,659
podcast this first question did come

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,079
from the grow help tab on the ire

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,219
genetics website if you go to my website

45
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,559
iregenetics.com on the top there's a row

46
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,959
of tabs one of them says does say grow

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,280
help or grow questions click on that tab

48
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,019
we'll ask you a couple of questions

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,180
you'll get the opportunity to type in

50
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:05,399
your grow question and of course if I

51
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,560
read your question on the podcast you do

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,239
win a free pack of seeds this first

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,340
message came from our friend who wants

to you let's keep going the message does

61
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:27,959
go a little bit like this it says hello

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,060
Rasta Jeff hello my friend ryotan great

63
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,219
to meet you it says are there

64
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,680
environmental conditions that can induce

65
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,020
a female cannabis plant to produce

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,120
pollen I like your show keep up the good

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,360
work from your friend roll oh I've been

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,500
saying that wrong that's rolly tan

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,420
r-o-i-t-a-n I apologize for pronouncing

70
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,939
that incorrectly the first time I was

71
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:49,500
doing the I first it is Roe tan I think

72
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,000
is how I would say that thank you for

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,080
the great message bro this is a great

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,939
question

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,680
um are there conditions environmental

76
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,840
conditions and or factors that will

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,580
induce a female cannabis plant to

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,019
produce pollen now this is a great

79
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,760
question but it puts a lot of thoughts

80
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,099
in my mind and sends me down a lot of

81
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,719
different Avenues of thinking if the

82
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,000
female cannabis plant is putting off

83
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,180
pollen it has probably got some sort of

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,459
intersex trait or it has gone way too

85
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,560
long in the flowering cycle so let me

86
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,319
back up I say this a lot of times not

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,640
everybody listens to every episode

88
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,500
cannabis's main goal the Cannabis

89
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,939
plant's number one goal we think it's to

90
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,280
get us higher right we love that that's

91
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,560
just a side effect of cannabis cannabis

92
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,259
is number one goal its whole goal in

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,300
life for that plant is to reproduce the

94
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,158
female plants want to receive pollen so

95
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,620
that they can make seeds so they can

96
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,179
continue their generation next year and

97
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,759
just like you the male plant's whole

98
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,799
goal in life is to reproduce that male

99
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,479
plant wants to get nice and Tall drop

100
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,920
pollen onto some ladies that way the

101
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,959
lady will receive the pollen she'll

102
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,759
produce seeds she'll drop the seeds into

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,319
the Earth that male and female plant

104
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,000
will die at the end of the season but

105
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,378
guess what next year they get to

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
continue their genetics through the

107
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,579
seeds that they made and those plants

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,739
get to keep going that is cannabis main

109
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,440
goal is to reproduce and survive for

110
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,180
next year now in our Grow rooms we are

111
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,098
preventing the seeds from happening one

112
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,140
of our main goals is to stop the seed

113
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,639
production from happening we do that by

114
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,679
eliminating the male plants and not

115
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,059
having any pollen in the room now here's

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,400
another thing I'm sure I've said on this

117
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,540
podcast before it is the Jurassic Park

118
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:23,459
Theory nature always finds a way so even

119
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,199
if we do remove those male plants from

120
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,539
that grow room remove that pollen from

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,300
the room given the right conditions

122
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,040
given enough time that female plant May

123
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,840
produce seeds now I'm not sure that that

124
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,580
plant is going to produce Paul Island

125
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,560
specifically if pollen is coming from

126
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,418
that female plant that means we've got a

127
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,280
male flower on that female plant which

128
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:43,560
means that now that plant is possibly

129
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,599
labeled intersex depending on how long

130
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,939
we let it flower if you let almost any

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,340
plant go for long enough not not your

132
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,899
hazes those hazes those long 16 week

133
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,659
flowering plants take those out of this

134
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,459
equation if you take a normal 9 or 10

135
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,680
week eight or nine ten week flowering

136
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:01,138
hybrid And you Let It Go for 16 weeks

137
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,819
that plant will start to show intersex

138
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,240
traits and it possibly will produce

139
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:07,918
pollen if not just seed itself so there

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,199
are some conditions that can occur in

141
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,478
our grow room or even outside they will

142
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,280
encourage a female plant to try to

143
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,560
reproduce on its own and that's if it

144
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,539
does rhodolization which is by going too

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,160
long in the flowering phase eventually

146
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,800
that plant will just produce its own

147
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,780
flowers or sometimes going too long or

148
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,879
messing up certain environmental factors

149
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,379
or feeds or light we'll talk more about

150
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,180
that in a second some of those things

151
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:31,978
will encourage that plant to show

152
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,620
intersex traits and those intersex

153
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,659
flowers those male flowers can pollinate

154
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,579
that female plant now the question was

155
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,840
are there environmental conditions yes

156
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,120
let's talk about some of the

157
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,739
environmental conditions that can cause

158
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,300
I don't know if we want to call this

159
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,340
intersex I don't know if we want to lead

160
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,720
up to rhodolization there are a lot of

161
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,579
options here but let's talk about some

162
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,680
of the environmental conditions that

163
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:55,019
will cause I'm going to say seeds in

164
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,340
your plant because maybe not pollen but

165
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:58,319
these are some things that will cause

166
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:02,038
seeds in the plant because pollen's more

167
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,319
rare but seeds are not not uncommon in

168
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,418
cannabis so the plants could just be

169
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,800
intersex they could be intersex that

170
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:09,538
could just be the plant's genetics

171
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,220
sometimes the plant has male and female

172
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,860
chromosomes in there it's an intersex

173
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,840
plant it will create seeds on its own

174
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,340
that is a factor not environmental

175
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,579
sometimes the environment will bring it

176
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,679
out but sometimes it's just the genetics

177
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:25,019
sometimes light interruptions in the

178
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,538
dark period can cause intersex traits

179
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:29,519
which will lead to seeds so if your

180
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:31,439
plant was on 12 12 for a couple of weeks

181
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,478
and one day your timer failed and it

182
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,519
stayed on for 24 hours that's a good

183
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,918
possibility of getting seeds in that

184
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,779
room over and under feeding our plants

185
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,839
early in the flowering phase can also

186
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,119
lead to seeds or intersex traits things

187
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,758
like over feeding under feeding over

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,220
watering underwatering also high and low

189
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
temperatures can definitely lead to the

190
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,240
intersex Strait which will lead to seeds

191
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,698
in our product too high and too low of

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,500
humidity can lead to intersex or seeds

193
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,180
in the product another method that I've

194
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,639
talked about earlier on this podcast is

195
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,560
called rhodolization what that is like I

196
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,660
said before if we take a 9 or 10 week

197
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,720
flowering cannabis plant and we stretch

198
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,759
it out to 15 or 16 weeks eventually that

199
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,039
plant will produce its own seeds if we

200
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,139
don't cut it down that plant wants to

201
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,000
survive its whole goal is to make seeds

202
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,860
that female plants are going I got to

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,579
make seeds I got to make seeds and like

204
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,038
I said before nature does find a way so

205
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,659
there are many environmental things that

206
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:28,939
can cause this most of them are going to

207
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,960
be swings

208
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:32,879
inconsistencies and swings if you've got

209
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,500
something happening regularly and then

210
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,719
something goes why wildly out of control

211
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,519
that's most of the time when we do see

212
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,560
these problems in the grow so you're

213
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,779
asking about pollen pollen is less

214
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,459
common than seeds um to get pollen most

215
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,318
of the time you've got to do reversals

216
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,598
if you're getting pollen you've probably

217
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,300
got an intersex plant and a lot of times

218
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,740
uh Laden flower those male flowers that

219
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
pop up in a female plant those are

220
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,160
mostly sterile you got to be more

221
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,660
concerned about the early intersex

222
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,220
flowers those are what gonna what are

223
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,439
going to produce pollen most of the time

224
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,080
now here's a random rant attached to

225
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,879
this a lot of people are going to say if

226
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,740
that plant produces pollen and you get

227
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,560
seeds those seeds will all be females

228
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,300
guess what that is not 100 accurate if

229
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,220
you have a plant in your grow room that

230
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,020
was a female plant we thought it was a

231
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,699
female and pollen came from that plant

232
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:19,560
there's an issue with that plant

233
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,660
whatever plant it's seeded it's going to

234
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,879
produce seeds those seeds are going to

235
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,220
carry that potential problem however

236
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,900
those seeds were formed however that

237
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,979
pollen happened that's an issue in my

238
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,378
opinion because we should not have

239
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:33,360
pollen in the flower room those seeds

240
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,700
possibly do contain that problematic

241
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,740
Gene so if you're a grow room produced

242
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,240
seeds and you do not have any true males

243
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,700
in that room or you did not reverse

244
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,860
anything it is a very inaccurate

245
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,320
assumption to believe that all of those

246
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,879
seeds will be female there is no reason

247
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,278
to believe that those seeds will be

248
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,379
female those are possibly potentially

249
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:54,480
problematic seeds they came from a

250
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:55,980
problematic plant so keep that in mind

251
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,539
now let me go back and make sure I

252
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,399
answer this question I think we covered

253
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,259
it are there environmental conditions

254
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,299
that will induce a female to produce

255
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:05,338
pollen so pollen isn't going to be as

256
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,319
common as my final answer but seeds are

257
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,360
definitely more likely intersex plants

258
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,860
are very likely and once again a lot of

259
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
those things are caused by over and

260
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,940
under feeding out of control temperature

261
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,080
drastic swings and of course dark period

262
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,459
interruptions all right I feel like I

263
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,500
rambled on long enough about this

264
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,419
question my buddy Roe tan thank you for

265
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,100
the great question of course I do owe

266
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,019
you a free pack of seeds so please do

267
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,180
send me a follow-up email with your

268
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,039
shipping address and please do include a

269
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,559
real name because I have to hand deliver

270
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,778
these boxes to the the post office and I

271
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,879
don't like putting like Joe smokes fat

272
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:40,679
blunts at hotmail.com is your name that

273
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,360
[ __ ] doesn't look good please give me a

274
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,939
real name and a safe address to send

275
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,379
your seeds to you all right I've got

276
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,899
another great question here this one

277
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,480
came from our buddy grumpy toad no need

278
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,639
to be so grumpy bro cheer it up it's a

279
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,500
Toad's life this question says I've

280
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,120
heard you discuss purple pedials a

281
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,740
couple of times I'd like to get your

282
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,500
thoughts on how to prevent them right

283
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,839
from square one all right so let's back

284
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,759
up a little bit in several episodes when

285
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,800
I talk about defoliation I talk about

286
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,319
pulling off any Leaf which has got a

287
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,579
purple petiole that's a long stem so you

288
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,899
got those big leaves there are short

289
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,879
leaves on your plant little leaves and

290
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,100
you got bigger leaves with a long stem

291
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,299
coming out of the bud that long stem is

292
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,339
the petiole I've heard it called the

293
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,199
pedial the petiole today we're going to

294
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,420
say patio because that's just how I

295
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,100
[ __ ] say it but I always talk about

296
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:29,219
pulling off any leaves with purple

297
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,839
petals in a commercial grow I do heavy

298
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,000
defoliation in a commercial grow

299
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,339
facility because in my experience in my

300
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,899
opinion in those big leaves are where a

301
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,820
lot of the problems begin that's where

302
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,500
your powdery mildew happens that's where

303
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,360
the bugs like to hang out if you're

304
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,159
removing those big leaves that's just

305
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,440
less camping spots for powdery mildew

306
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,600
and for bugs and also then we allow more

307
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,279
airflow we allow more white penetration

308
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,920
it's just beneficial in many different

309
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:54,539
ways the reason I say and train people

310
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,219
to take off those leaves with the purple

311
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,379
petioles is because those are usually

312
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,060
the older bigger leaves it's real

313
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,519
obvious it's a real easy training

314
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,259
technique that's why I do it if I tell a

315
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,120
bunch of guys or gals that are going

316
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,980
into the grow take off all of the purple

317
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,778
petiole leaves that's a really easy

318
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,159
thing to identify and make and take it

319
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:12,539
off they don't have to come keep asking

320
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,639
me should I take this Leaf should I take

321
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,500
this one is that petiole purple pull

322
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,000
that [ __ ] off let's keep moving so

323
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,919
that's just a training technique and

324
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,360
kind of a Training Method for me the

325
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,159
reason that works like I said is because

326
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,659
those are usually the bigger older

327
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,278
leaves those are going to be the leaves

328
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,419
that are blocking the light those are

329
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:29,939
going to be the leaves that are also

330
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,219
going to attract and house those bugs

331
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,800
and problems should they show up so that

332
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,079
is mainly why I pull those big leaves

333
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,699
off not always is there a problem with

334
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,139
those big leaves

335
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,600
um this person is asking how do I

336
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,519
prevent that from Square One thanks I

337
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,159
love the podcast and the genetics as

338
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,820
well piece from grumpy toad

339
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,600
um

340
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,399
now sometimes those purple petioles are

341
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,920
unpreventable sometimes that is just

342
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,320
genetics sometimes your plant is going

343
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,259
to do that uh Girl Scout cookies and

344
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,180
cookies crosses uh oftentimes are going

345
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,740
to make purple petals if you grow them

346
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,199
correctly

347
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,299
um when my girl scout cookies gets black

348
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,759
leaves and looks real dark and the

349
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,679
purple petioles are real almost burgundy

350
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,319
and maroon that was when the Girl Scout

351
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:19,019
cookies flowers tasted the best the pH

352
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,640
was low the EC was low and those plants

353
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,919
were just barely eating almost starving

354
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,899
but they tasted so good when you smoked

355
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,120
them so those always made purple

356
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,500
petioles so that was kind of a desirable

357
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,299
trait and I think that was sort of

358
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,100
genetics I've got a couple of plants the

359
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,899
machine there's a phenotype of the

360
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,579
machine that no matter what you do the

361
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,139
petioles will be purple it's not a

362
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:39,299
problem it's just a pigment in the plant

363
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,100
so it's not always going to be something

364
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,620
you can prevent and it's not a problem

365
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,000
purple petals are not a big deal like I

366
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,560
said before it's just a training

367
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,019
technique it was something I was using

368
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,599
to show the crew how to defoliate quite

369
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,060
quickly in the room now things you can

370
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,180
do to Monitor and prevent these purple

371
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:59,458
petals is temperature and nutrition are

372
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,319
mainly the causes of the purple petals

373
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,939
is it getting cold in the room are you

374
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,260
feeding the plants enough phosphorus and

375
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,139
potassium those are going to be the

376
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:09,659
things that lead to that purple also too

377
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,919
much light can purple up these petals a

378
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,719
little bit if you've got too much light

379
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,719
in the room that is one of the things

380
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,579
that can be causing the purple petioles

381
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,339
is your water cold are your plants

382
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:23,278
sitting in cold water perhaps you

383
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,959
watered earlier today so the way that I

384
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,519
water I've got a sometimes it's a three

385
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,379
sometimes it's a seven gallon pot let's

386
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,778
just say a three gallon pot today

387
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,759
got a three gallon pot it sits in a

388
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:34,200
saucer if I were to go out of town for

389
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,600
the weekend I would water that three

390
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,759
gallon pot until it ran off and halfway

391
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,379
filled my saucer that would buy me an

392
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,639
extra day or two of watering I only do

393
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,439
this to bigger plants that are not going

394
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,240
to get root down there's no problem but

395
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,100
this is how I buy an extra day or two to

396
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,919
go enjoy my weekend I over water that

397
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,659
saucer a little bit if that plant is

398
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,879
sitting on the floor and that water gets

399
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:55,379
real cold that will make everything turn

400
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,419
purple you'll your leaves will get

401
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:59,759
purple the petioles will get purple that

402
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,159
cold water is going to cause purpleness

403
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,778
in that grow so is there is the water

404
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,000
cold are the plants sitting on the cold

405
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,980
floor are you feeding it cold water are

406
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,679
they sitting in cold water that could be

407
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,600
something leading to your purpling but

408
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,338
like I've said a couple of times purple

409
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,019
is not always an issue I'm not taking

410
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,940
off the purple leaves because it's a

411
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,679
problem I'm taking them off because it's

412
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,740
a simple training technique and I like

413
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,419
to do semi-heavy defoliation all right

414
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,100
my dude grumpy toad I hope I answered

415
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,019
your question I don't always remove

416
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,060
those purple petals because they are a

417
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,039
problem a lot of times I'm just removing

418
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,559
those as a preventative measure because

419
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,899
I do like to do such heavy defoliation

420
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,699
my friend grumpy toad I do owe you a

421
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,379
free pack of irie genetic seeds because

422
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,420
I read your message here on the on the

423
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,458
podcast please be sure to send me your

424
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,198
address and once again do include a real

425
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,879
name I can't ship a package to grumpy

426
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:49,500
toad that may get noticed and they're

427
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,299
going to look at me silly at the post

428
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,799
office all right let's keep moving

429
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:55,198
because I've got another great question

430
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,419
here in front of me this one came from

431
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,578
our friend lazy big shout out to our

buddy lazy this one is a general grow

433
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,958
question and it goes a lot like this it

00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,338
I'm hanging out with you guys recording

438
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:12,899
a podcast the dogs are chilling passed

439
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,779
out I'm good in stone and it's finally

440
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,100
cooling down it was super hot today it's

441
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:18,539
too early to start bitching about the

442
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,220
heat it's only going to get worse let's

443
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,679
keep going it says I'm currently growing

444
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,800
lemon Jeffrey and I'm growing with Gaia

445
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,859
green organic organic dry amendments big

446
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,319
shout out to Gaia green organic dry

447
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,060
amendments that's good [ __ ] it says the

448
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,459
garden is currently in week four of

449
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,379
flower I use compost teas yesterday and

450
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,778
I noticed a couple of leaves are drying

451
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:41,278
and getting a little bit crispy this

452
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:42,480
could be a lot of things I wish I had a

453
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,519
picture here that would have helped a

454
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,278
lot but we'll figure this out

455
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,740
says I'm not sure what causes this maybe

456
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,059
the fan is drying it out so far it's

457
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,698
just a couple of leaves on the side

458
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,739
where the fan is but she is starting to

459
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:59,338
smell amazing thank you for all you do

460
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,500
any and any advice you can give bro this

461
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,420
is a very common thing that I see when

462
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,000
people have grow questions or grow

463
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,979
issues when you see something that you

464
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,379
think is probably causing the problem

465
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,079
follow your gut go with your intuition

466
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:15,059
trust yourself trust your instincts from

467
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,939
the things that you have said it's the

468
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:19,859
fan it is probably that fan and you said

469
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,240
that in the message so you're you've got

470
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,800
to trust yourself you've got you're

471
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,198
smart enough you're confident enough and

472
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,419
you know what you're talking about so uh

473
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,979
rely on your gut your gut was right this

474
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,019
was the fan it was a good idea to send

475
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,699
me a message and double check but this

476
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,799
sounds like it is the fan let's talk

477
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,859
about what happens when you put too much

478
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,319
wind on your ganja plants I think the

479
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,419
leaves start to get a papery and dried

480
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,860
up texture they'll get kind of papery is

481
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,360
the best way I can put it they should be

482
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,220
Supple right this should have some juice

483
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,839
to them but instead if the Fan's been

484
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,278
hitting them they'll get this sound to

485
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,720
them you know what I mean that that

486
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:52,860
they'll get that going on and they

487
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,379
shouldn't sound like that they should

488
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,459
sound like soft and supple and moist so

489
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,019
if they're starting to get crispy

490
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,059
because the wind is blowing on them that

491
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,919
is definitely from the fan if they're

492
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:04,019
turning yellow in that spot curling up

493
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,078
starting to fall off that is from the

494
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:09,418
fan also this could be because it is too

495
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,879
hot or too dry in your grow room which

496
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:13,919
also could be from the fan you're just

497
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,240
drying up that area and the plan is just

498
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,980
going bro I don't know what to do and

499
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,480
it's trying to rescue the rest of the

500
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,058
plant and move the moisture around and

501
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,699
sacrifice those couple of leaves it also

502
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:25,798
could be over fed but

503
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,079
bro when you said right away

504
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,579
it's the fan I'm just gonna go with you

505
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,619
and believe that it is the fan it could

506
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,058
also be too much light it could be a lot

507
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,500
of factors but since I don't have any

508
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:36,480
photos in here and you said the fan

509
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,038
right away we're gonna say it's the fan

510
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,319
so if your leaves start to get like a

511
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:42,240
leathery or papery Texture they don't

512
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,038
look juicy like they used to and you

513
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,779
haven't overfed or done anything strange

514
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,538
and you got a fan blowing right on them

515
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:50,038
it is probably the fan I like to have a

516
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:51,538
fan going in the grow room at all times

517
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,579
that's a good idea we want to keep the

518
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,779
air moving uh bugs don't want to build

519
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:56,279
homes where there's a bunch of wind

520
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,319
moving if you've got a fan coming around

521
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,519
every couple of seconds spider mites are

522
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,538
going to go bro this sucks let's go

523
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,579
somewhere else and they'll go build

524
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,798
somewhere else also I've seen spider

525
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,659
mites use the fan to move from one plant

526
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,440
to another so if you've already got them

527
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,600
you're just going to move them around

528
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,000
with that but what we really want the

529
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,798
goal is to have all of the leaves just

530
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,359
rustling we want them moving we don't

531
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:17,038
want them waving around like the wacky

532
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,659
wild inflatable tube man in front of the

533
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,640
car dealership but you just want them

534
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,900
moving you want the leaves every leaf

535
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,520
should just be moving around and

536
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,380
rustling not all at the same time if

537
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,639
your fan oscillates make sure that it

538
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,080
hits this part out of the room and then

539
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,520
comes back and hits that part and then

540
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,678
hits that part if you need more than one

541
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,538
fan put more than one fan in there

542
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,759
something I want to talk about with

543
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:37,798
multiple fans I had a friend who would

544
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,740
try to set up multiple fans in the room

545
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,720
to blow and oscillate exactly the same

546
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,880
it looked really cool it was a neat idea

547
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,120
it looked super organized it was really

548
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,220
nice for the OCD and the 80d but

549
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,139
I don't think that was most beneficial

550
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,200
for the room what we were trying to do

551
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,520
is mix the air all he was doing what I

552
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
think was happening I think if we would

553
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,879
have blown smoke in the room we would

554
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,819
have just saw smoke move around the room

555
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,260
and a pattern we want the air to mix we

556
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,359
don't want to just move the air around

557
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,519
we want to mix the air so that we don't

558
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:09,899
get microclimates if you just move the

559
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,579
air around you're going to have pockets

560
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,798
of Hot Pockets of coal just moving

561
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:16,319
around we want to mix that air together

562
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,819
so don't just get your fans organized to

563
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,798
blow like this you're just going to

564
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:22,079
create a wind tunnel we want a wind

565
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:25,139
blender not just a tunnel so that's my

566
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,879
advice for that but my dude lazy it does

567
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,500
sound like your main issue is just that

568
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,059
those fans are blowing that fan is

569
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,980
blowing on those leaves and drying them

570
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:33,899
out just imagine if you went and sat in

571
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,759
front of a high-powered fan all day or

572
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,200
just a couple hours how long would it

573
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,879
take for the side of your face where the

574
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,860
fan is just to start feel start feeling

575
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,600
kind of weird you ever go to a sporting

576
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:44,579
event or go fishing or just go to a

577
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,558
concert be outside all day facing One

578
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:47,819
Direction and the Sun is just hitting

579
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,259
you from one side the fan is hitting

580
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,879
from an other the wind is hitting you

581
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:52,500
from that side the end of the day that

582
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,179
whole side just feels [ __ ] up and wind

583
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,859
burnt and sunburned that's what you're

584
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,900
doing to the plants my dude so either

585
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:59,699
rotate the plants a little bit or turn

586
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,798
down that fan if you rotate the plants

587
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,120
do it every hour or so just a little bit

588
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,400
so you're not hitting the same exact

589
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,798
spot but my advice my recommendation

590
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,600
would be either to pull the fan back or

591
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,099
turn that bad [ __ ] down or turn it off

592
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,558
for a little while occasionally just

593
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:15,359
give those plants a little bit of a rest

594
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,038
all right my dude lazy I do want to
