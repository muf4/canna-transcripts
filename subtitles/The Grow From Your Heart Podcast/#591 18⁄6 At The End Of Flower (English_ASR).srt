flavors and aromas

i also think those flavors and aromas

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,558
are always accompanied by a really nice

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:52,000
buzz on the back of the package it says

21
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:54,878
it contains 68.17 percent thc

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,238

i do also apologize for the old mailing

108
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,798
list at which i failed

109
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,039
miserably i asked a bunch of people to

110
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,879
email me at a certain email address

111
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,479
and i said that i would add add you to

112
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,158
the emailing list

113
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,919
unfortunately google thought that that

114
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,679
was a big spam list and it would never

115
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,158
work for me i couldn't figure it out

116
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,159
and i failed so i apologize but the new

117
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,439
mailing list does go through mailchimp

118
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,439
and it works beautifully

119
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,039
so i encourage you and i invite you to

120
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,878

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
all things ross to jeff at

127
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,519
iriegenetics.com

128
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,519
all right this is the part of the show

129
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,120
where we where we work our way into

130
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,519
patreon messages

131
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,519
in a previous episode i talked about

132
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,120
changing our timer for daylight savings

133
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,959
time and i asked for feedback

134
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,120
i got a couple of great messages i chose

135
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,120
three of them for today's episode

136
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,160
this one goes just like this it says hey

137
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
ross to jeff

138
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
when it comes to daylight savings time i

139
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,478
personally change my life and my

140
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,520
schedule

141
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,839
and continue on with the regular 12 12.

142
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,560
then once my flowering plants have

143
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,039
finished

144
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,000
i change the cycle back to my preferred

145
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,000
time

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
years ago i would change the timer and

147
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
the night hours

148
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,160
i would extend the dark period for one

149
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
hour that day

150
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,320
or night before to compensate for

151
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,319
daylight savings time

152
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,519
now it just feels better for me to allow

153
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,159
them to continue

154
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,399
as scheduled and change my routine for

155
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,479
them yes that is probably the way to go

156
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,560
it goes on to say the last thing these

157
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,959
plants need is more stress

158
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,720
humans care about daylight savings time

159
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,038
plants most likely think it is

160
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,840
ridiculous that is absolutely right

161
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,000
uh time is a human construct time is an

162
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,599
invention time is imaginary

163
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,680
um i always say that but then think

164
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,360
about payday if i don't pay you for your

165
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,840
time you're gonna be [ __ ] about time

166
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,759
but

167
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,679
time is imaginary time is made up the

168
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,360
plants don't care what the clock says

169
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
the plants are worried about did the sun

170
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,879
come up and did the sun go down

171
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,319
that's how they know what time it was

172
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,839
that is all they are worried about so

173
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,120
you were absolutely correct the last

174
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,679
thing they need is more uh

175
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
stress and yes we did invent time that

176
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,519
is a human construct so you are right

177
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,038
the plants probably think that daylight

178
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,799
savings time is

179
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,719
ridiculous i want to send a special

180
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,478

another message right in front of me

185
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,079
it comes from our friend michael s and

186
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,918
it says i just let it ride

187
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,079
i set up my light cycle with daylight

188
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,839
savings time in mind so here's a person

189

190

191
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,639

adjust their plants to the schedule of

their lives

241
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,280
them on today's podcast

242
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,079
but i saw a theme everybody is adjusting

243
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,239
their life

244
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,439
to the plants not adjusting the plants

245
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,519
to their lives so

246
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,680
that shows some dedication and some

247
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,519
commitment to our gardens

248
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,959
all right let's work our way into some

249
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,478
fresh content here

250
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,478
this is a question that comes from our

251
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,598
friend flavormaker a longtime listener a

252
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,199
longtime supporter

253
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,959
what up flavor maker i hope you're well

254
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,199
bro thank you for the great content

255
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,079
this question goes i've got a grow

256
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,680
question

257
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:56,719
i've got an led i've got a t5 led

258
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,959
2 bar sunblaze light so this is a it's

259
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
an

260
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,399
led t5 light which sounds like uh it's a

261
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,160
combo light

262
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:06,560
it's an led a t5 led bulb and a

263
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,280
sun blaze two bar fixture so there are

264
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,800
two of these

265
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,878
led t5 bulbs and a sun blaze fixture

266
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,919
it's a lot of words for just one light

267
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,360
it goes on to say

268
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,598
and germination week one to two how high

269
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,400
overhead do people average so the

270
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,878
question here

271
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,918
is how high above the plants in weeks

272
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,199
one and two

273
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:30,318
would i hang my t5 led

274
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,759
two bar sun blaze light it says are

275
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,000
bleaching and burning

276
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,158
issues will there be recovery did i

277
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,799
alter the outcome by stressing them at

278
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:38,639
birth

279
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,478
then it says i definitely see variations

280
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,479
among three different breeders

281
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,800
i feel embarrassed asking this but we

282
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,720
all get better on micro topics like this

283
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,799
never be embarrassed to ask a question

284
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
that's what i'm here for i've probably

285
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,479
made the mistake that i can prevent you

286
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
from making i've probably seen somebody

287
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
make the mistake that you're about to

288
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,719
make

289
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,240
so never be afraid to ask a question uh

290
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,839
the stupidest question is the one you

291
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,519
didn't ask and then that mistake you

292
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,519
made was a stupid mistake because you

293
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,360
didn't ask the stupid question

294
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,799
let me get myself back on track those

295
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,440
dabs are working you guys

296
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,599
uh it says i learn uh the smallest

297
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
changes can have huge adverse outcomes

298
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,519
that is very true in cannabis

299
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,279
and something you do today you're not

300
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,839
gonna see the outcome for seven to ten

301
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:19,120
days

302
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
and then you don't get to actually see

303
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,080
the real outcome for maybe nine weeks

304
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,320
so yes small things uh do have huge

305
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,160
outcomes it says from soil density

306
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,959
light and environmental all things have

307
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,958
a huge effect anyway feel free to share

308
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,479
or just help with the question above

309
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,000
thanks man

310
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,440
well i'm doing both i'm going to share

311
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,480
and i'm going to help you with your

312
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,519
question

313
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,200
i didn't know much about the t5 led

314
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,200
sunblaze lighting i actually had to do

315
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
some research on that i'm not familiar

316
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,560
with that product

317
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,799
everything i read and everything that

318
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,278
makes sense to me says to keep that

319
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,079
light

320
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,039
between 12 and 24 inches above your

321
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,278
canopy

322
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,079
a lot of the things said 18 inches is

323
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,399
ideal

324
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,519
some things said 12 some said go as high

325
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,639
as 24

326
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,360
so between 12 and 24 seems ideal about

327
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,240
18 inches makes sense to me

328
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,399
what i would do put your bot your light

329
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
18 to 24 inches above your plant i'm

330
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,240
guessing that's about here from the

331
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,958
table

332
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,480
18 or 24 inches above the plant you want

333
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,000
this so give yourself a couple inches

334
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,639
for the plant you got to raise that up

335
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
okay 18 to 24 inches above the plant pay

336
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,679
attention to that plant

337
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,519
does the plant look like it wants more

338
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,439
light is it lifting up

339
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
if the leaves go up if they're praying

340
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,560
it may want more light

341
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,879
if the leaves start curling and going

342
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,719
down it may be getting too much light

343
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,159
if the leaves get droopy it has had

344
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,959
enough light and it wants a little bit

345
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,719
of a break

346
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,078
you could probably raise that light up

347
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,600
and give it a little bit

348
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,439
less ppfd a little bit less humiles

349
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,040
per joule wouldn't be a bad idea for

350
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,519
that plant so

351
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,799
the main the main thing you have to do

352
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,799
is watch the plant

353
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,159
put that light above the plant watch how

354
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,799
the plant responds

355
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,240
put your hand right above the plant just

356
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,039
touch the top of the plant leave your

357
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,560
hand there

358
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,240
does it feel like your hand is getting a

359
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,439
burn does it feel uncomfortable does it

360
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,200
feel like a sunburn

361
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,480
if your hand doesn't want to stay there

362
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,839
either does the plant

363
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,519
if you can leave your hand there and be

364
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,440
like yeah that's fine the plant will

365
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,600
probably agree with you

366
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,120
you have to watch the plant though over

367
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,639
time that plant may say

368
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,078
hey i've had enough of that light you

369
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,838
may want to raise that light or turn it

370
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,278
down or i'm going to react to you

371
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
the first thing it will do the leaves

372
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,559
will start to kind of claw down

373
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,399
they'll just kind of just instead of

374
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,239
being nice and turgid and they have that

375
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,200
almost a taco almost a canoe when

376
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,278
they're just right

377
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
they'll start to droop just a little bit

378
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,078
and then if you give them too much light

379
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,360
they'll droop even they'll claw a little

380
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,078
bit and if you give them too much light

381
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,680
they'll droop

382
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,679
so they'll claw down and then they will

383
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,838
droop that is saying hey i've had way

384
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,439
too much light i'm having issues

385
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,760
one of the most obvious signs you may

386
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,600
see is leaf twisting but that is a sign

387
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,799
of way too much light way too intense

388
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,079
which i don't think you'll get from

389
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,599
these little two bars

390
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,000
so my advice to you is to start about 24

391
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,399
inches

392
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
above the canopy slowly raise it down to

393
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,039
about 18 inches

394
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,399
and pay attention to the plants as they

395
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,399
get bigger as they get more stout

396
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,679
they'll be able to photosynthesize more

397
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,240
they'll want and they'll be able to take

398
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,078
more light so just lower that light down

399
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,680
don't go past 12 inches from everything

400
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,039
i read because that is when you will

401
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,838
experience the next thing you talked

402
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,319
about

403
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,240
burning and bleaching uh these led

404
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
lights do have the potential to burn

405
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
and bleach our plants if we get them too

406
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,160
close so

407
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,519
keep that 12 inch distance at least

408
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,559
focus a little bit higher while the

409
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,399
plants are smaller

410
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,239
and i think that will keep you safe

411
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,519
unfortunately i have not used these

412
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,039
specific lights

413
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,039
most of what i talk about on the show is

414
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,599
first hand experience i had to research

415
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,719
this

416
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,920
so i'm giving you second-hand advice

417
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,278
uh using logic and uh research

418
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,039
that's all i've got for you on that

419
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,799
let's keep going there's more

420
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,159
it says anyway oh i think i wrapped it

421
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,159
up feel free to use this

422
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,759
or just help with the questions above i

423
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,159
hope i answered your question

424
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,000
uh 18 to 24 inches i would start about

425
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,759
24 work it down to 18.

426
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,278
don't go closer than those 12 inches

427
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,200
because on my research

428
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,720
that is where we start getting the

429
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,278
burning the bleaching

430
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,120
and the issues all right flavor maker i

431
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,958
want to thank you for the great question

432
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,480
let me know how your plants are looking

433
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,239
if you've got a follow-up let me know i

434
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,360
want to know how high above that canopy

435
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
you've got the plants

436
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
and how it's working for you again the

437
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,120
plants are the boss if the plants are

438
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,879
responding negatively

439
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,799
raise or lower that [ __ ] light i

440
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,360
could be wrong we could be wrong

441
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,319
that plant could be an anomaly adjust to

442
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,440
the plants i love

443
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,360
meters i love gauges i love toys i love

444
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
advice i love all that stuff but the

445
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,079
main

446
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,399
thing about this is watching the plants

447
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,519
we are in a relationship with the plants

448
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,278
the only way you're going to make a

449
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,120
relationship work is by watching the

450
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,439
thing you're in a relationship with

451
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,959
and adjusting to that you can message me

452
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,399
and say hey what would i do

453
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,838
and i could give you advice and tell you

454
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,000
what to do but you have to watch how the

455
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,600
plant responds to that and if i'm wrong

456
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,278
i could be wrong that plant may want

457
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,879
something different you've got to pay

458
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:55,439
attention to the plants the meters may

459
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,679
say

460
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
put it when you get a meter when you get

461
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,799
equipment they're always recommended

462
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,679
ranges all the growers myself the

463
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,198
podcast

464
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,039
the internet we've all got recommended

465
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,359
ranges your plant may say

466
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,519
[ __ ] your recommended range i'm a weirdo

467
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,120
i want a ph of 9. the plant's not ever

468
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,360
going to want a ph of 9 but maybe

469
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,360
there's one plant out there that thrives

470
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,800
one cannabis plant that wants that ph of

471
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,720
9. we've got to give it that

472
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,000
who cares what the meters say who cares

473
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
what the internet says

474
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,519
that plant wants something weird i'm a

475
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,039
weird dude i like to eat and drink

476
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,959
random [ __ ] that most people probably

477
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,319
wouldn't enjoy drink a gang of kombucha

478
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,000
most people would say i don't want that

479
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,240
much kombucha i do

480
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,240
i'm an anomaly i would be happy with it

481
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,839
so maybe your plants are weirdos maybe

482
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,120
they're anomalies just like me

483
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
maybe you got to feed them a little bit

484
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,360
differently adjust them a little bit

485
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,278
differently

486
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,800
always pay attention to the plants i've

487
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,360
rambled long enough about that

488
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,198
let's get into a new email this one says

489
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,879
yo ross to jeff how are you

490
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,039
i heard you mention it one time to

491
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,240
increase the lights on time

492
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,159
toward the end of the flowering phase so

493
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
increase the lights on times

494
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,679
how i should have read that increase the

495
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,958
lights on time toward the end of the

496
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,479
flowering phase

497
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,799
if you don't mind me asking could you

498
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,560
please give me another rundown on that

499
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,919
i'm in the last stages of flowering and

500
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,278
i want to try this

501
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,198
thank you so much for all of your

502
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,958
knowledge i'm such a better grower

503
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,240
thanks to you that means a lot to me i'm

504
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,679
glad you're a better grower

505
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
from listening to me that means you took

506
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,359
my advice and you actually used it

507
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,480
so shout out to you as well i'm glad

508
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
you're improving and i'm glad you're

509
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
seeing improvement

510
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,360
it says i'm growing a rise for the third

511
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,078
run and i look forward to purchasing

512
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,680
more

513
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,439
i haven't been smoking for eight months

514
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,078
now because i've been on probation oh

515
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,399
man

516
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,838
um i want to see pictures of your arise

517
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,360
and i can't wait to smoke with you when

518
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,880
you're off of probation

519
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,800
it says that's about to end now and i'll

520
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:39,759
be able to smoke all of the aries i've

521
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,240
been drawing and

522
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,000
curing oh man i'm excited for that for

523
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
you this one came from our friend reggae

524
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,120
in my head

525
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,959
and he signed it with love and respect

526
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,480
uh that is a great email i'm going to

527
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,319
talk about this but let me

528
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,240
read another one because i had two

529
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,800
people send me basically the same

530
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
question

531
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,198
and i'm going to cover the one answer

532
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
with both of the both of these emails

533
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,639
with one answer

534
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,639
it says ross to jeff thanks for the grow

535
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,480
knowledge and the positive vibes

536
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,240
i'm starting week eight of flower in

537
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,519
prohibition land the trikes are starting

538
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,360
to become cloudy

539
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,360
on the dude grow show they mention

540
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,959
flipping back to 1806

541
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,879
from 1212 during the last week of flower

542
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,239
they say it will increase terps smell

543
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,838
and taste does

544
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,519
this work then they list a little bit

545
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,320
about their growth setup

546
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,159
it says i've been i have a weaker light

547
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,839
and it seems i'm about a week behind on

548
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,120
flowering compared to the recommended

549
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,560
eight weeks

550
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
when a breeder recommends eight weeks

551
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,758
they always mean nine weeks eight weeks

552
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,399
is a good selling point

553
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,879
always expect nine weeks it goes on to

554
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,159
say

555
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,759
the trikes are telling me they have

556
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,439
about a week to go so i thought about

557
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,759
going to the 18-6 like

558
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,880
schedule what are your thoughts i also

559
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,879
plan to reveg

560
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,000
this is why i wanted to add this one it

561
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,958
says i also wanted to

562
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,639
re-veg a few smaller branches and take

563
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,278
clones after harvest

564
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,959
will the 18-6 schedule have a negative

565
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,439
effect on the clones

566
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,000
uh thanks dude peace love and good

567
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,519
health

568
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,318
i don't know if they want their name

569
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,640
said but uh shout out to our friend zach

570
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,720
uh so that's a great question we've got

571
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,280
two messages about basically the same

572
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,279
thing

573
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,480
with a couple of different details so

574
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,318
let's talk about this

575
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,959
a little bit what am i talking about

576
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,480
when i say turn the timer back on to 18

577
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,720
six at the end of flower that sounds

578
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,000
completely absurd we've had these plants

579
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,919
on 12 12

580
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,400
for eight or nine weeks at this point

581
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,520
and i'm saying turn the timer back

582
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,919
to 18 hours on and six hours off

583
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,839
for the last seven to ten days of flower

584
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,759
now why would i want to do that to our

585
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,439
plants that is crazy right

586
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,919
let's think about what makes our plants

587
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,519
grow what makes our plants grow the main

588
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,360
thing that makes our plants happen the

589
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,279
main source of energy is

590
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,879
light they want that photon energy they

591
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,879
want to photosynthesize

592
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
we give them light they use that light

593
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,600
for life

594
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,000
energy so i think by turning the lights

595
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,359
on

596
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,440
for the last seven to ten days of flower

597
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,959
we give them more light energy i feel

598
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,360
like the plants beef up

599
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,000
they get bulkier they get more dense

600
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,319
they

601
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
kind of ripen up a little bit better and

602
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,399
also i think the harvest weight is

603
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
heavier you're giving them more light

604
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,519
hours per day you're giving them six

605
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
more hours per day

606
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,679
for seven to ten days that's up to 60

607
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,160
more hours of light time

608
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,400
i see a lot of growth at the end of the

609
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,400
light cycle a lot of the plants we grow

610
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,440
bulk up right at the end i say don't cut

611
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,280
these too early

612
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,038
because that last two weeks is when it

613
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,440
really packs on the weight

614
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,440
so if we turn that light cycle onto 18 6

615
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,880
during that same bulking period

616
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,960
they get a lot of light energy and

617
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,600
they're able to beef up now people are

618
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
going to say

619
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,399
aren't they going to something's going

620
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,759
to go wrong they're going to re-veg or

621
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
they're going to start to have problems

622
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,200
no

623
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,480
they're not because in 7 to 10 days

624
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
we're going to cut them down

625
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,160
we're going to start flushing the same

626
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,160
time that we do this light change

627
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,200
start flushing change the light back to

628
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,440
18 6

629
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,120
and pay close attention to the trichomes

630
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,840
and pay attention to the top buds of the

631
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,159
plants

632
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,359
the minute you see new nubby weird

633
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,759
growth coming out of there

634
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,000
harvest that is your first sign of reeve

635
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,558
edge it is time to cut that plant down

636
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,200
you probably won't see that for 12 to 14

637
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,759
days

638
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,600
some plants will take 16 17 days to show

639
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,038
you any signs of reveg

640
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:21,439
so i feel like that last 7 10 14 days

641
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,279
throw it on 18 6 and they will really

642
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,000
beef up at the end now the part about

643
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,678
terps where was i the part about terps

644
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,480
and what else does it increase

645
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,559
smell and taste i don't think that comes

646
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,880
with the 12 12.

647
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,879
that is not why i do or that's not why i

648
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,679
do the 18 6. i apologize

649
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,400
the reason i do the 18 6 is for denser

650
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,200
buds

651
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,160
bigger buds it basically makes them beef

652
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,440
up and they also ripen up more quickly

653
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,679
they're getting more light they just

654
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,640
ripen more quickly i don't think it has

655
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,200
anything to do

656
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,038
with aroma and flavor the terps and

657
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,919
aroma and flavor can be increased by

658
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:57,679
harvesting

659
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,320
after a long dark period you don't have

660
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,159
to have a extremely long dark period but

661
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,519
if you do a 12 hour dark period a lot of

662
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,080
people like to throw the plants

663
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,000
in a 24-hour dark period that is where

664
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,240
you can develop more terps

665
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,200
the daylight kind of the sun the light

666
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,960
are bright lights

667
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,279
they break down the terps the plants

668
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,880
produce more terpenes in the dark period

669
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,879
so if you can catch them right before

670
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,799
they start photosynthesizing

671
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,080
that is when the most terps are present

672
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,759
so that is the idea

673
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,678
behind cutting them down and the dark

674
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,319
after an extended dark period that is

675
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,080
where

676
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,359
uh the terps come in so i think you may

677
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,000
have crossed two different things

678
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,839
if not uh that is what i think you got

679
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
that from that's where that comes from

680
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,519
the 18 6 is more for density more for

681
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,240
faster riping

682
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,839
ripening so yes i do fully encourage and

683
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,279
that is a trick that i kept

684
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,279
i've known that for a little while a lot

685
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,240
of us in the growing industry have known

686
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,759
that for a minute

687
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,359
we just keep it under our belts we don't

688
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,038
talk a lot about that is a breeder it's

689
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,479
a trick that i can use

690
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,079
to speed up rooms i can get more

691
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
breeding projects going it really helps

692
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,480
me out

693
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,159
but yes the last 7 to 10 maybe 14 days

694
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,599
you can turn your light timer back on

695
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,840
for 18 hours on

696
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,439
and six hours off and it will increase

697
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,720
the performance of your plants you'll

698
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,640
get a better harvest weight

699
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,640
you'll get denser buds and they will

700
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,400
ripen up a little bit more quickly

701
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,080
under that light cycle and you should be

702
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,600
flushing at that time anyway

703
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,519
so if they do show you any signs of

704
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,798
revenge too early chop them down

705
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,240
immediately

706
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,879
now there was another part to this

707
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,798
question it said i want to re-veg

708
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,120
a few smaller branches and take clones

709
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,759
after harvest will the 18-6 schedule

710
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,359
have a negative effect on the clones no

711
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,158
the 18-6 schedule

712
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,798
will have a wonderful effect on your

713
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,720
reveg

714
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,079
and your clones that is exactly what you

715
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,640
want you're giving yourself

716
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,240
a head start most of the time people

717
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,200
harvest their plants and they leave a

718
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,720
couple of buds

719
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,480
and then they say now i'm going to

720
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,200
re-veg these buds and they put it back

721
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,279
under 24 hours or 18 sixths of light

722
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
you're already 10 days ahead of that

723
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:56,399
your plant has been under 18

724
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,558
6 of light for 7 10 maybe 14 days

725
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,080
before you harvested most of the buds

726
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,918
now you took off the big part you just

727
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,759
left a couple of little buds leave like

728
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,280
three or four or maybe five thumb size

729
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,319
buds at the bottom that's all you need

730
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,399
to re-veg

731
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,759
and they're already having a head start

732
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,559
they're already seven to ten

733
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,400
fourteen days into the edge process how

734
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,119
we re-veg is just by turning the lights

735
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,360
back on

736
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,199
to a vegetative cycle and patiently

737
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,479
waiting so you've already started that

738
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,159
now you're flushing

739
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,759
it's about time to cut down you'll

740
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,159
harvest almost everything like i said

741
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,240
before

742
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,240
leave three to five little thumb size

743
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,798
nuggets then we want to

744
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,640
start feeding a high nitrogen diet again

745
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,480
go back to your vegetative diet

746
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,159
that'll trigger those plants to go back

747
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,400
into the vegetative stage

748
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,520
let them grow they're gonna start

749
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,000
spitting out

750
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,038
weird dill looking leaves like leaves

751
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,640
like a dill plant

752
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,240
it's going to be really strange looking

753
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,919
leaves for a little while they'll be

754
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,359
twisted they'll be claw-liked

755
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,759
they'll be different colors they'll have

756
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,000
variegations they'll be mutations

757
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,440
then one day it'll spit out a new shoot

758
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,960
that looks like just a [ __ ] baby

759
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,400
clone came out of that plant

760
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,319
and you'll feel like you've been blessed

761
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,840
you'll look at it and you'll go ah

762
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,079
it's got this brand new shoot coming

763
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,798
right out of it clone that let it get

764
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,319
big enough

765
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,319
maybe wait for two or three of those to

766
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,558
happen and clone those

767
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,918
make a clone out of that shoot let that

768
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,918
shoot root

769
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,960
once that shoot is rooted pot it grow it

770
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,679
up a little bit

771
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,000
take clones from that plant and use that

772
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,080
one

773
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,519
as your clone donor and now work with

774
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,158
those new clones you want to kind of

775
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,918
grow it

776
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,679
let all those hormones get kind of

777
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,600
realigned before we start running that

778
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,919
plan again so cut a clone of it

779
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,839
grow out that clone then use that clone

780
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,720
as your new clone donor it may slow you

781
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,399
down a little bit

782
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,640
but in my opinion that's the best way to

783
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,480
preserve the genetics keep them healthy

784
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,480
and not experience any sort of loss or

785
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,000
degradation or the words that we don't

786
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,839
use because they're not real anymore

787
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
i've done a full podcast episode on the

788
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,678
word that i'm not going to use

789
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,798
all right so i want to thank you both my

790
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,278
voice is starting to skip i'm going to

791
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,319
grab a drink

792
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,159
all right guys thank you for being

793
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,798
patient with me while i hydrated i want

794
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,720
to thank my buddy zack and my buddy

795
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,639
reggae in my head both for the great

796
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,200
messages i hope i helped you out

797
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,080
yes i do encourage that 18 6 at the end

798
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,240
of flower that will

799
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,879
bulk up and beef up your crop and it

800
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,640
will set you on the path for success

801
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,919
for reveg it's the same thing that we

802
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
would do in a reveg

803
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,278
uh you're just cutting down part of the

804
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,798
plant when it's ready leave the

805
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,000
the rest of it there to grow for you

806
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,798
then in a couple of weeks you'll have

807
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,480
fresh shoots

808
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,158
a few weeks from there you'll have brand

809
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,679
new plants all right i want to thank you

810
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,760
guys both for the great message

811
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,360
i look forward to some sort of an update

812
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,480
from both of you how did this work for

813
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,319
you did you notice

814
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,159
a fatter harvest weight did you notice a

815
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,678
denser bud did you notice that things

816
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,400
finished up a little bit more quickly

817
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,080
for you

818
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,000
send me some feedback you've got the

819
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,439
email address i look forward to hearing

820
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,798

you wonderful cannabis growers out there

826
