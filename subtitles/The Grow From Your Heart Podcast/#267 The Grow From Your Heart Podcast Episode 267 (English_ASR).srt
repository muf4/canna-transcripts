00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:06,229
this orange flavor e citrusy grapefruit

127
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:09,250
hashed lemon time sugar wax from rock

128
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:12,319
and extracts it's a new Pueblo company I

129
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,029
really like it I took it to uh just as

130
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,439
something fun to take along with me to a

131
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:17,750
meeting uh several uh

132
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,360
jab kids is the wrong term but it's the

133
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,009
closest one we got I guess but several

134
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,919
folks getting together davon and it

135
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:26,060
ended up being the talk of the table

136
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:29,359
which I thought was funny because we

137
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:38,180
were dab in raw herbs on distillate that

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:40,009
night two fresh frozen product how much

139
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,519
do you know about that I'm actually not

140
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:46,039
sure on that particular step the big

141
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:49,639
part of the big pitch of this company is

142
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,800
it's a proprietary mixed gas okay um

143
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,050
extraction that explains a lot to me

144
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,060
somebody that knows a lot not a lot but

145
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,129
that smokes a lot of different types of

146
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,860
concentrates I can tell that this that's

147
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:02,779
why I asked if it was live resin because

148
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,150
your color and texture color and texture

149
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,679
are not what I'm used to seeing from a

150
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:10,129
beauty and extraction unless it's live

151
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,870
resin very very close to what I see you

152
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:14,930
call that color

153
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,930
[Music]

154
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,439
it's a butterscotch color that's a

155
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,810
really good description of it it's not

156
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,180
orange it's not yellow and when it was

157
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:29,389
fresh it had a little more orange

158
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:31,668
yellowish pop to it okay but it's a

159
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,659
propane butane mace I can see the

160
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:34,399
problem

161
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,410
it's this is legitimately the first

162
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,389
propane hat I've ever dabbed I've seen

163
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,820
it made there's a great vice media

164
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,099
documentary where they go and interview

165
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,319
a guy building a propane extraction rig

166
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,270
in the the hash that comes out of that

167
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,980
is like frightening Lee Orange like

168
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:51,589
she's a tourist okay well what I've

169
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,360
smoked a bunch of propane hash oil from

170
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:57,799
our friends at altitude organic medicine

171
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,750
I've smoked a bunch of propane hash from

172
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,850
altitude and it's always white like

173
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,769
completely white and it's real lot it's

174
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,410
kind of mushy and it always stays really

175
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:07,759
good what I don't like about it is it

176
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,800
kind of makes my lungs feel sort of

177
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,430
heavy it gives me a butter long sort of

178
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,949
feeling um I over dab myself with some

179
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,310
of this one night I I way overheated my

180
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:21,709
banger and took an insanely hot dab just

181
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,970
not paying attention the last one I'd

182
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:29,239
taken a little cool so I was a little

183
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,890
yeah while I was coughing the cough

184
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,290
scene would go on quite a while and for

185
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,649
a minute I considered is it the mixed

186
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,810
gas but from everything I've seen all

187
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:41,689
the lab testing it's it's totally clean

188
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,339
okay we talked about lipids and plant

189
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:44,990
fats and all that kind of stuff on that

190
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:47,599
episode previous so I wonder if there

191
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,949
are plans and lipids and stuff like that

192
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,950
left behind in there that they're not

193
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:53,300
taking out either way it's marvelous

194
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,699
hash is what I wanted to get to the

195
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,160
flavors oh my goodness yeah it's like ah

196
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,479
at first it was like orgy and then I

197
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,370
waited a few minutes and as my mouth

198
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,840
dried up it turned to grapefruits just

199
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,069
straight-up grapefruits on my tongue it

200
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,069
was really delicious I didn't want to

201
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,120
take a drink for a while but I had to

202
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,949
grapefruit coating now it's really nice

203
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,800
nice good job on bringing the good hash

204
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,389
big shadow to rocking extracts you said

205
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,000
they're a Pueblo company yeah they're

206
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:21,079
the right up the street from the shop

207
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,029
that's pretty cool yeah the good guys

208
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,009
they make several different products the

209
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,229
other deliveries better always be on

210
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,439
time yeah they're never let them over

211
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,460
it's cute

212
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,340
but yeah there are what the manifest

213
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,070
can you walk over a product yep um they

214
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,120
uh they make it a couple different

215
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,890
products that I'm enjoying right now

216
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,658
they've also got the first vape pen

217
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,720
cartridge I've actually not felt bad

218
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:47,399
about spending money on nice does it

219
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,009
come in flavors or is it just one flavor

220
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,759
right now it's just a single extract run

221
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:56,069
so it's a mixed batch no strain specific

222
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:58,620
sativa or indica a hybrid blend of

223
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,100
course they just threw a bunch of [ __ ]

224
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:14,399
together yeah I have a feeling House

225
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:15,810
Blue Dream I think it is your local weed

226
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,970
store if that's the thing where you are

227
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:19,919

afraid to try new stuff you're gonna get

250
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,789
a quality product I'd been I'd spend a

251
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:04,679
lot of time going through the edible

252
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:06,779
section making sure I'd tried kind of

253
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,099
one of everything and I'm doing the same

254
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,110
thing with the hash lately and that's

255
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,149
it's a lot of fun it's fun watching you

256
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:17,460
step up your hash game it's so expensive

257
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:24,029
you started off basically I think I gave

258
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:27,330
you your first dad probably yep the hot

259
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:31,980

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:33,420
oil on the dabber oh those days when

261
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,190
they were selling us dental pick dabbers

262
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:36,629
at the events for like the price of dab

263
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,839
tools and they were just old dental

264
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:41,088
dabbers from Pakistan yep yeah oh man so

265

of just booboo to now you take pretty

268

275
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:03,588
shop got in a shipment of that a long

276
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,479
time ago and I ended up with like eight

277
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:08,059
of them at home by the time we sold out

278
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:09,469
I had a a back stash I probably grew

279
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:11,328
that it was delicious

280
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:14,119
yeah that's a really great strain it

281
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:16,338
grows very well very very well it's uh

282
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:17,418

is what it would be it's a pineapple

284
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:21,048
diesel cross on accident I think but

285
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:22,578
there were a bunch of seeds and that's

286
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:25,369
what came out is that phenotype and it

287
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:27,588
grows like a [ __ ] savage super sweet

303
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:59,178
let me pull the files it would let me

304
00:11:57,619 --> 00:12:01,099
drag the files from the memory card to

305
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:02,568

the zoom h6 and ran the USB cable to the

309
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:10,908
computer and tried to open the files

310

that way and use it as a file reader it

311

00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:02,639
reschedule cannabis considered a

330
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,140
Schedule one drug which let me tell you

331
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
what that means schedule one drugs are

332
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,429
the most dangerous drugs with the most

333
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,700
potential for abuse and psychological

334
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:14,809
dependence so now cannabis still is in

335
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:19,350
the same category as LSD as heroin and

336
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:22,708
ecstasy there is no medicinal value Mike

337
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:24,509
how do you feel about that I saw it

338
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:28,229
coming a mile away but I'm still

339
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:30,208
disappointed it's 2016 so about 90 days

340
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,730
ago the DEA said that they were

341
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:34,319
considering rescheduling cannabis they

342
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,579
taunted everybody they teased us they

343
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,740
made us all think that there may be a

344
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:39,448
change and then in 90 days they just

345
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,240
said oh never mind sorry we're not gonna

346
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:46,019
do that well there was a change and it

347
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,240
is big it's just not as big as the media

348
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:52,350
made it sound they didn't reschedule

349
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,259
cannabis but they did open up more

350
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,709
research growths production sites for

351
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:01,379
cannabis for pretty much everybody

352
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:03,000
listenings whole lifetime the feds have

353
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,409
been growing marijuana for research

354
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,429
purposes at the University of

355
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:12,149
Mississippi sorry I'm still dabbed out

356
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:13,559
but that's the only farm that grew it

357
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:17,100
and if you've been watching Sanjay

358
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:20,629
Gupta's weed 1 2 &amp; 3 specials on CNN

359
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:23,550
they covered the research restriction

360
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:26,490
topic pretty well basically there's only

361
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:28,769
one farm growing research marijuana in

362
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,980
the US which means there's almost no

363
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:34,139
variety of cannabis to research in the

364
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,720
u.s. they've only got four strains or

365
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,159
some really restricted number sorry my

366
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,570
lungs are still doing a little not good

367
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,219
dad good we can hear it but you're good

368
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,860
you're making enough sense to make it

369
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,009
matter yeah I hope you guys are

370
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,080
following along I'm trying

371
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,789
really hard not to watch it right into

372
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,550
the minds do it really well T shouldn't

373
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:54,839
see the look on his face this makes you

374
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:57,609
dumb it's nonsense you just stoned guys

375
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,590
I've seen the cannabis that they grow at

376
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,090
that facility there in Mississippi and

377
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,590
it's garbage they don't have a proper

378
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,060
girl facility they don't have proper

379
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,980
technique I don't think they have good

380
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,079
genetics I've seen what they're doing

381
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,519
and it isn't it's an embarrassing growth

382
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,940
my girl looks like that I would put

383
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:18,610
matches to it there's you can pull up

384
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,170
some footage on YouTube what a lot of it

385
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,210
looks like and when you listen to the

386
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:25,149
researchers talk they tell you we can

387
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:29,710
produce anything that's requested we can

388
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:32,949
mix a batch of 19% THC or 10 percent or

389
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,389
4 percent or 12% whatever you want and

390
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,009
when you look at what he's talking about

391
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,169
he's basically like well we just grind

392
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:41,049
up enough leaf and stem in there to

393
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:43,959
bring the 21 down to 12 or the grind

394
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:45,969
enough but over the 4% until it's a 9%

395
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,379
and it's yeah it's not pretty

396
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,139
I've seen their facility they don't

397
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,939
think they ever passed 15% um the feds

398
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:54,279
have run a medical marijuana program

399
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,760
since 82

400
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:00,490
where patients get mailed 11 ounces each

401
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,009
of pre-rolled joints every month and

402
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,919
like a coffee can look a really cool

403
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:07,179
coffee tin that's actually a bizarre

404
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,509
collectible in the u.s. now because you

405
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:11,949
can find them on ebay from time to time

406
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,450
in one of the federal patients that does

407
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,240
a lot of public speaking will give them

408
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:19,480
away for charity events like silent

409
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,639
auctions and stuff but the marijuana

410
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,700
that those patients get is from this

411
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,100
farm and some of the video of it

412
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,620
especially that was taken at conferences

413
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,560
in the late 90s early thousands the

414
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,830
quality's just atrocious if they have to

415
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:38,319
unroll the pre roll joints rehydrated in

416
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,690
the fridge like old hippie style with a

417
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,280
piece of lettuce or a piece of bread to

418
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,040
bring the moisture content up real quick

419
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:51,009
and then reroll it like Mexican brick

420
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:52,299
weed from America yep guys in

421
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:55,990
Mississippi hire me I know how to grow

422
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:58,490
cannabis let's do this since a lot of

423
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,440
that footage was shot I hope so

424
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,028
did you see the CNN footage do you know

425
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,770
it well enough to discuss quality from

426
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:05,179
that I think that's the footage that I

427
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,709
saw they walk into the room with like it

428
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,360
looks like a shitty led and they've got

429
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:13,880
like a small hydro table and the plants

430
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:16,369
just looks sad yeah it's definitely not

431
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,500
like Colorado commercial production

432
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:23,119
quality it's definitely not homegrown

433
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,558
quality yeah super stretchy plants with

434
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:38,058
the UFO light above them that's what it

435
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:41,000
made me think of you know the DEA claims

436
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:43,399
that cannabis does not have a currently

437
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,009
accepted medical use in the US and there

438
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,320
is a lack of accepted safety for its use

439
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:51,200
under medical supervision and it has a

440
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,480
high potential for abuse all of that is

441
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,370
[ __ ] you guys what why aren't

442
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,660
worried like why is it the DEA smart

443
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:59,839
enough to see that all of that is

444
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:03,080
[ __ ] oh they totally do so what's

445
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:06,529
there is not doesn't have anything to do

446
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:11,199
with marijuana itself and everything to

447
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:13,639
do with seceding power in my opinion

448
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,679
marijuana being illegal is an amazingly

449
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,820
powerful tool it does several things

450
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:23,960
that they want to keep happening if they

451
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:25,399
lose that stick they lose a lot there

452
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,250
are a lot of things that are built on

453
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,800
that pyramid they crumble after is it

454
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,569
the pharmaceutical industry there are

455
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,220
definitely financial interests the

456
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:37,058
president is it the prison industry um

457
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,829
there's been some good reporting lately

458
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:43,099
Washington I don't remember which paper

459
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:45,289
but looking at major lobbying efforts

460
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:47,808
recently against marijuana rescheduling

461
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:49,129
against marijuana legalization in a lot

462
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:51,769
of that's coming from alcohol and

463
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:54,260
pharmaceuticals alcohol pharmaceutical

464
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:56,629
prisons okay well there's a big report

465
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,910
out recently that legal marijuana states

466
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,410
in medical marijuana states huge

467
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,290
reductions in Medicare and Medicaid

468
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:07,009
prescription billing oh wow

469
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:09,950
and it was an in enough states and over

470
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:10,808
the same time lines to draw causation

471
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,370
conclusions

472
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:16,928
not a one-to-one like mathematical

473
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:20,469
conclusion but enough to infer that

474
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:22,990
where people have easy free legal access

475
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,319
to cannabis they can just swing by a

476
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:28,179
store and get it basically they consume

477
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,069
significantly less prescription drugs

478
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:34,090
and that's a huge loss to a major

479
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:36,879
industry same thing with alcohol when

480
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:39,699
twenty-something males have marijuana

481
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,200
that they can go buy at a store they

482
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:46,659
consume significantly less alcohol

483
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,580
really hot sorry honestly when I got my

484
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,620
first medical marijuana card I told

485
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:51,849
myself and my friends and my family I

486
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:53,619
was like you know what I can smoke all

487
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:55,990
the cannabis I want I'm gonna quit

488
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:58,538
drinking and they're like [ __ ] and

489
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,250
here it is probably six seven eight

490
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:02,169
years maybe later I haven't drank since

491
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,490
I started using medical cannabis since I

492
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:05,830
was able to go to the dispensary and

493
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,140
point at that jar and say let me get an

494
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,970
ounce of that tastiness right there and

495
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,799
go home and roll up and puff down as

496
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,909
hard as I want without any worries cuz

497
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:14,408
back in the day I didn't know where I

498
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:16,299
was gonna buy my next weed you have to

499
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:17,650
deserve that outs cuz you paid way too

500
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,089
much and you don't know if that dude is

501
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:22,780
gonna have good weed or not next time

502
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:24,490
now you can medicate as needed alcohol I

503
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:25,779
don't like being drunk I'm no good I

504
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,480
don't know if I'm really good at it or

505
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:31,200
really bad I'm not sure what the case is

506
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,370
but I know that it's not my friend

507
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:39,069
over and cannabis I've got a very

508
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:40,779
similar story it's not I quit drinking

509
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:42,908
before I had a medical marijuana card

510
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:46,869
but essentially the same thing is I got

511
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:48,039
really good at drinking I decided that I

512
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,509
didn't like some of those character

513
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:52,629
traits so I was gonna take a couple days

514
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:55,240
off couple days became a week and now

515
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:59,559
it's been like eight years I went to

516
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:02,440
Mardi Gras two years ago and had three

517
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,329
beers like just like with dinners just

518
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,679
because I was there and I was at sea

519
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,329
level and I wouldn't feel the

520
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,100
repercussions of it the next day like I

521
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:11,349
would have had I had up three beers here

522
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:13,509
is that where Davey happened bro no we

523
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:18,369
found out we found out about Davey the

524
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:20,000
day after we got to New Orleans how we

525
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:23,179
found out

526
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,549
the the day we got there she took a sip

527
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,160
her first drink and got queasy it was

528
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:30,409
like man and then the second day the

529
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,590
same thing and after the second day she

530
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,269
was like go to Walgreens Oh

531
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:36,649
yep so we were in New Orleans for 10

532
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:38,000
days and we found out we were we were

533
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,800
pregnant on the second day you get to

534
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,960
celebrate while you're there kind of we

535
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,190
did it was a it was great we celebrated

536
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,779
the whole time way too truckload of good

537
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,640
food newly rose to real heavy drinkers

538
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,450
anyway so it's not like we're missing

539
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,509
out on anything

540
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:54,230
right yeah but yeah had a great time and

541
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,819
I had a lot to celebrate but yes I don't

542
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,349
really drink and a lot of it has to do

543
00:21:55,819 --> 00:22:00,349
with I can relax and unwind with

544
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:02,990
cannabis it's a much better unwind

545
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:05,929
there's no there's no penalty the next

546
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,630
day then that's what I hated about

547
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:15,380
drinking is the incredibly bad decisions

548
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:17,120
that would make while drinking how to

549
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,960
get home DRI am I gonna drive I'm gonna

550
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,219
take a taxi

551
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,930
am I gonna jump in one of my drunk

552
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:26,210
friends cars so many mornings have woken

553
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,049
up saying I am so thankful that I made

554
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,180
it home last night

555
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:32,859
I talked to someone today who's like I

556
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,860
quit drinking this morning and it's like

557
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:38,299
[Music]

558
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:39,889
yeah the point we're at here is people

559
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,539
are consuming less cannabis are

560
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:43,610
consuming less alcohol they're consuming

561
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:49,099
less pills because we were able to

562
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:50,479
access cannabis safely it's it's there's

563
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:52,250
a lot of people who don't want that to

564
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,549
happen and there's a lot of people who

565
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:59,029
don't want to lose that lever of control

566
00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:02,029
on people it's an immediate excuse to

567
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:04,549
get to further a car stop I smell

568
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:06,799
marijuana there's there's not one video

569
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,509
on YouTube or the cop goes I smell

570
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,119
heroin I want to search your vehicle I

571
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:13,400
want to smoke cocaine or I smell cocaine

572
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,769
I want to search your vehicle right that

573
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,960
video doesn't exist it never gets said I

574
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:21,289
I think I smell a gun I want to search

575
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,850
your vehicle I think I smell someone

576
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:24,440
you're smuggling in your trunk I want to

577
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:26,599
search your vehicle though that video

578
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,769
doesn't exist every single video is I

579
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:31,899
think I smell marijuana when that

580
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:33,400
steps away everything's for long for

581
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,290
someone gets a little bit harder that is

582
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,490
so true because I recently got pulled

583
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,558
over I talked about it on the show

584
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,609
and the first thing that cop said was do

585
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,609
you have any marijuana in the vehicle

586
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:43,990
and I had to reprogram my brain real

587
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:45,099
quickly because first doesn't make no

588
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,789
sir there's no weed in here but then I

589
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:48,428
was like wait a minute

590
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:49,569
it's 2016 bro you've got your badge on

591
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:50,679
you've got your purple card in your

592
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:52,960
pocket and I looked him straight in the

593
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,790
face and I go maybe because I wasn't

594
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,630
certain but there may be there could be

595
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:58,178
weed here

596
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,120
he's like it smells really strong gonna

597
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:01,990
grow and just being honest with him

598
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,489
everything he had no problem to mess

599
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,620
with me now see right that does take all

600
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,750
the stress I'm not a criminal anymore

601
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:09,308
the only thing I used to do wrong was

602
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,470
have a bunch of weed in the car those

603
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:15,428
first couple of law enforcement

604
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:17,380
interactions or bizarre it you did it's

605
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:20,980
almost a genetic response with this

606
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,900
community at this point right because if

607
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,519
we admit to being part of the cannabis

608
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,860
community or having cannabis or

609
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,240
supporting it in any way we subject

610
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:31,389
ourselves to all sorts of horrible

611
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,819
things in Colorado that's not true

612
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,040
anymore and as those realization sets

613
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:38,619
and it's awesome have you been to an

614
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,599
event or a place where you have consumed

615
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:43,119
cannabis near law enforcement and

616
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:47,109
they've watched you many before it was

617
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:49,359
legal I I was up in Denver and Boulder

618
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:52,709
during the heydays of the boulder

619
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:56,139
Poquette on 4/20 in the Civic Center

620
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,429
gatherings on 4/20 where tens or

621
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,470
hundreds of thousands of people get

622
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:02,470
together all at once everybody lights up

623
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:05,860
at the same time sort of as a dare go

624
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,789
ahead there's 10,000 of us arrests 11 of

625
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:09,099
us see what happens

626
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:11,139
right like we're gonna peacefully sit

627
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:13,808
here and smoke pot and play bad music

628
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,730
and then cheer at 4:20 and all smoke pot

629
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:20,799
together and there'll be a big cloud and

630
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:22,808
by 5 o'clock we'll all be gone the shops

631
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,079
in the area that sell food will all make

632
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:28,629
an extra 5 grand 10 grand that day

633
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,799
everybody's happy everybody's people

634
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,050
that have to take public transportation

635
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:35,710
or commute during those hours

636
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:38,740
anyway but uber drivers are making math

637
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:42,430
in downtown Denver a hundred thousand

638
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:45,309
people just convene at Civic Center the

639
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,840
cops stand by and they always had and

640
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:48,639
just kind of made sure everything was

641
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:52,629
calm and collected didn't nobody got out

642
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,540
of control and it was fine but at post

643
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,490
legalization only a few okay it's just

644
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:59,200
I've been too busy I always end up

645
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,730
working those it's not the guy that goes

646
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,069

654
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:20,710
used to go to smoke nights at the cloud9

655
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,269
hookah bar here in Pueblo I've talked

656
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,769
about him on the podcast way back in the

657
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,319
early episodes cuz that was back in late

658
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:27,639
in the day here since then they've shut

659
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,799
him down we can't do that here in Pueblo

660
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,990
anymore but we were at the cloud nine

661
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,759
hookah bar and I was sitting I was at

662
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,930
the bar which is it's an old bar but

663
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,190
it's now turned into a hookah bar but

664
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,360
they didn't change much you know still

665
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,460
got the bar seating they just put

666
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,069
hookahs out I was sitting at the bar

667
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,930
there was one person and then me and in

668
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:46,779
front of me is my little oil slick pad

669
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:48,340
my rig my torch a little variety of hash

670
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,779
I was hitting the ball or a toe ball I

671
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:51,459
was in a bowl that night and a bowl some

672
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:53,740
flowers in it had a bag of weed next to

673
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,090
me I was just chilling just sitting on

674
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,890
the barstool and the cops walked in

675
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:59,109
three of them together and I heard the

676
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,060
radio you always do that and then they

677
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:03,909
walk in and I was like what do I do

678
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:05,919
but I thought [ __ ] sit here dude

679
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,930
you're a 21 year old you're over 21

680
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,690
you've got a red card in your pocket a

681
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,070
purple card now cannabis is legal the

682
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,750
owner of this place is who's gonna have

683
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:15,669
to [ __ ] deal with anything yep those

684
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,049
cops walked right past me and they went

685
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,580
and talked to the owner the owner nodded

686
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:20,559
and smiled a couple times they all shook

687
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:22,329
hands the cops walked past me and they

688
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,369
kind of looked at my what I had sitting

689
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:26,379
on the table like they looked at it more

690
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:27,909
curiously they were like huh okay that's

691
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,680
what smoke and hash supplies look like

692
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,090
and they walked past it they nodded I

693
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,769
mean they kind of smiled like hey what's

694
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:34,389
up stoner like one of them kind of

695
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:35,650
condescendingly smile like what's up you

696
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,970
weed head you're high as [ __ ] and the

697
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:39,880
other cheek just kind of nodded politely

698
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:42,789
they walked out one of the kids that was

699
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,440
there was younger dude just just being a

700
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,990
typical dude I probably would have said

701
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,390
the same thing

702
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:49,730
[ __ ] 15 years ago but as soon as man

703
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,710
[ __ ] the police and I looked at him I

704
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,329
was like bro unfuck those police they

705
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,650
didn't take my hash and we didn't go to

706
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:56,839
jail cuz you were the first [ __ ]

707
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,809
they saw when they walked in here they

708
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:01,009
didn't do anything so yeah it was remind

709
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:02,720
him like we didn't go to jail for that

710
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:04,549
dude like two years ago they would have

711
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,190
threw me on the floor like just for

712
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:08,869
having that [ __ ] there there are a lot

713
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,660
of people who don't want to give that

714
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:15,259
out yeah that's why you see thing the

715
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:16,700
DEA make decisions like this it's it's

716
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:19,369
just silly

717
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,380
it is silly if they if they would have

718
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:23,178
rescheduled cannabis to a Schedule 2

719
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,080
substance what that would have mean what

720
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,750
that would have meant is it would have

721
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,000
now been allowable for prescriptions by

722
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,230
all medical doctors so they'd be able to

723
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,200
write you a prescription for cannabis

724
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:38,058
basically well and they'd also it makes

725
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,769
research significantly easier I mean I

726
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:41,990
hate to keep going back to CNN's

727
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:43,730
specials because usually obnoxious is

728
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,599
all ho but their marijuana reporting

729
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:49,849
that they've done has been spectacular

730
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:52,579
it's easy to research cocaine in the

731
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:55,039
u.s. because it's a schedule 2 drug it's

732
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:58,308
easy just it's easy to research schedule

733
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,440
2 drugs because their schedule - if

734
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:03,049
their schedule one significantly more

735
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,500
red tape right much much harder to

736
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:08,779
research and it I mean it takes years of

737
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,599
going through approval meeting since

738
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:14,960
submitting paperwork years to just begin

739
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,819
your study and then in studies take

740
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,000
years to complete they take more years

741
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:22,579
to write the conclusions examine the

742
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,509
data all of that and then more years to

743
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:28,129
publish and when you had another decade

744
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:30,079
of red tape at the beginning of all that

745
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:33,309
marijuana research is something that's

746
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,659
not gonna happen it's a world mint and

747
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:39,410
that's because it's a Schedule one drug

748
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:42,410
and moving it to schedule two changes

749
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,480
all that any competent researcher can

750
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:46,070
submit the paperwork and and within a

751
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,319
relatively reasonable amount of time

752
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:50,720
begin researching and none of those

753
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,329
changes were made and so even though

754
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,579
they created more places to grow it in

755
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,889
the selection of research grade cannabis

756
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:57,960
that's

757
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:01,440
available to be researched will it be

758
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,870
expanding access to that material won't

759
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,529
be and that's really unfortunate and

760
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:09,919
this is why I rant and tell people to

761
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:13,230
vote because none of this [ __ ] changes

762
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,570
until a most of the people involved in

763
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,670
this have gotten old and died like we

764
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:21,179
just have to wait until the generation

765
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:22,890
that's so tied to this has seceded power

766
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,560
to our generation and it's just going to

767
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,690
take another couple of decades and in

768
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:30,539
the meantime we need more people in our

769
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,299
generation politically active so many

770
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,920
members of our community tuned out

771
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:37,049
because if we spoke up about what we

772
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,340
believed in we went to jail I was scared

773
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:40,139
dude back in the day you would be like

774
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:43,349
come to these City Council meetings with

775
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,270
me and I was like no I grow and that

776
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:47,250
scared well and that's part of the

777
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:49,259
reason I became the politically active

778
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,230
one down here is because I didn't

779
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:55,289
physically have the space to grow or the

780
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:59,360
money for the start-up equipment and so

781
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:02,789
I like go ahead and show my ass valoran

782
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:06,719
twelve square feet with the dirty

783
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:08,129
laundry prick like I didn't care I like

784
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,720
I could have cops show up

785
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,800
I could have cops pull me over and

786
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:18,390
demand to search my car and I'd be okay

787
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:19,799
most of the time but I was able to risk

788
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,300
it where a lot of other people in the

789
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,690
community simply weren't in a position

790
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:26,789
to do that but one of the one of the

791
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:30,120
really interesting things that I noticed

792
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:34,440
when I spoke out is that it gives you a

793
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:36,119
shield when you go to City Council

794
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,830
meeting reporters for the local paper

795
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,479
there if you live in a major city

796
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:44,549
reporters from major papers are there

797
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,039
when the guy that comes down to City

798
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:48,869
Council or keep the county commissioner

799
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,470
meetings it makes really coherent

800
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:55,229
articulate arguments in the appropriate

801
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:57,600
manner and setting for marijuana gets

802
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,849
his house raided they break a bunch of

803
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,129
furniture rough him up shoot his dog and

804
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:03,689
don't find anything that [ __ ] makes the

805
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,150
front page of the Washington Post every

806
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,269
day

807
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:10,480
for a week and they know this and so it

808
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:12,519
doesn't have it um and that's not

809
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,220
universally true it's not being granted

810
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:16,990
immunity by a judge but it does provide

811
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,799
you a significant layer of protection

812
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:22,599
because by becoming mildly public you

813
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,819
you're granted some of that protection

814
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:27,099
all right so the DEA failed you guys

815
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:28,599

took a screenshot of it cuz it's much

840
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:24,519
easier than going and searching through

841
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,569
[ __ ] let me read this message to you

842
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:29,559
I've got two of them

843
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:31,269
this one says first of all he said sucks

844
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:32,500
that uh sucks about the grannie podcast

845
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,019
he said you killed it with the emails

846
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,970
though and we love your updates on your

847
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:38,440
genetics I should give you guys a quick

848
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,559
update on that cuz I said I would do

849
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,110
that the mail plan we are now the date

850
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:46,569
is now the 17th so we are now 14 days in

851
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:48,909
you guys the mail plant just started

852
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:50,740
sprinkle in a little bit of pollen any

853
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,180
bits of pollen are coming out of them

854
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,190
the girls are just starting to go into

855
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,570
full flower you can see their calyx

856
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:58,269
pistols are just going nuts right now

857
00:33:55,569 --> 00:34:00,399
the stretch phase is in full fledge

858
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:03,609
they'll quit stretching in about a week

859
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,900
I'll let them get pollen in about seven

860
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,769
to ten days they'll start getting a lot

861
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,349
of pollen on them

862
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:09,849
I've got pollen in a jar for backup I've

863
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:12,369
also got that male throw in pollen

864
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:13,750
they're gonna get pollinated so they're

865
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:15,190
looking great everything is going

866
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,079
beautifully on the breeding project

867
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,858
everything is on schedule not a whole

868
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,989
lot to report

869
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:22,778
than the male his balls are big and he's

870
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:24,699
just barely started to dump pollen so

871
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:26,199
this message says I was wondering what

872
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,759
you know about Fox tailing I don't

873
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,460
really understand what is happening and

874
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:33,068
whether it's a good or bad thing when it

875
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:35,048
happens maybe a good show topic and I

876
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:36,579
replied with great topic so that was a

877
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:38,798
message that actually came from a friend

878
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:40,720

879

got more of a chance if you hit me girl

895
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:09,788
from your heart this guy wants to know

896
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,068
about foxtail Fox sealing is when you're

897
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:14,410
growing above some buds and they start

898
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,969
popping off like little fox tails at

899
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:17,469
little fingers they just get they start

900
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:23,108
spreading out a little bit I call them

901
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:24,338
cheeto fingers - yeah but some strains

902
00:35:23,108 --> 00:35:27,009
its genetic

903
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:29,380
if the bud stays compact if it's tight

904
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:32,588
and it's doing what looks like a fox

905
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,930
tail more like a crown that's genetic if

906
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:37,239
it's if the bud is airy and you're

907
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:38,679
getting fox telly that is most likely

908
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:40,509
from too much heat

909
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,159
that's usually what that's from your

910
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:43,778
plants are probably too hot they're

911
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,420
probably a little bit too close to the

912
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:48,119
light also coming with that Fox tailing

913
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,409
you may see a little bit of taco leaf

914
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,778
your leaf will look healthy it'll look

915
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:54,429
cool except on the edges it'll be

916
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:55,719
folding up like a taco shell like you

917
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:57,699
could just make a little taco out of

918
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:00,248
your leaf right there both of those are

919
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:02,348
visual descriptors if you're seeing both

920
00:36:00,248 --> 00:36:05,318
of those it certainly is too hot in

921
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:06,640
there I've seen it most often when we

922
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:08,108
call it kissing this guy where the

923
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,108
plants grow up into the light while

924
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:12,880
they're yeah that's probably what's

925
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:15,369
happening to this guys poor plants yep

926
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,630
if that's not the case Fox tailing could

927
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:18,190
be from too much humidity that are

928
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,930
trying to spread out this is the

929
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,818
grossest description I could give you

930
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:24,038
but it's completely accurate Mike knows

931
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:26,558
where I'm going with this imagine you're

932
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:27,750
in Las Vegas in the summer it's like 114

933
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,360
degrees outside

934
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,639
ah you're man junk tries to just move

935
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,140
away from your body these plants are

936
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:35,699
doing the same thing it's too hot your

937
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:36,929
balls want to get away these plants are

938
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:38,189
too hot they want to get away from each

939
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:39,449
other they're starting to sweat they're

940
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,710
getting funky they're just trying to

941
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,809
peel off of each other so they're not

942
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,030
getting sweaty and funky and compacted

943
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:46,739
in there the plants just trying to make

944
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,240
some air room for itself so it's trying

945
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:50,399
to get spongy it's Foxx stealing out a

946
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,869
little bit it's gonna get fluffy it's

947
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,090
gonna it's getting heat stressed it's

948
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:56,250
probably what's happening or you could

949
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,320
be over feeding it that also could could

950
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:00,389
make Fox tailing happen one of those

951
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,059
three it's it's nine times out of ten

952
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:05,339
your plant hit the light yeah some

953
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:07,889
Jillybean phenotypes like to make a

954
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,960
crown shape foxtail strawberry-banana

955
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:12,900
tangi likes to make some crown shaped

956
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,360
foxtails tangi I guess it's a lot of

957
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,920
things cross to that Caleo worse with

958
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,900
the Lemon Haze we know that dinner

959
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,840
difficult in eight inches the light it

960
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,420
was a [ __ ] okay but it was the plant

961
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,920
would drip and so the grower wouldn't

962
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,210
get rid of it because it would just

963
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,400
literally when you were harvesting it

964
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:32,639
would just drip THC it wasn't saying

965
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,910
that's awesome I know that plant the

966
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:38,309
closer if it go light a wood foxtail

967
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:39,929
like mad so chances are bro your plant

968
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:43,019
is getting too close to the light it's a

969
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:43,529
little bit too hot if that's not the

970
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:45,420
case

971
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,740

972

980
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,480
screenshot this one says hey I was

981
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,490
listening to the podcast today and I

982
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,199
heard you answer my questions on the air

983
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:09,509
this one's from Nazareth 4:20 by the way

984
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,369
he said it was a trip and he said thanks

985
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:18,180
for that bro what I see I work with

986
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:19,650
robots I just may act like robots kind

987
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,969
of like office space but different he

988
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,090
said I got another question for the show

989
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:25,619
I was hoping you could shine some light

990
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,390
it says show questions number one what

991
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:29,549
are your thoughts on monster cropping

992
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:31,589
and he said I read that it's great to

993
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,450
use first scrog honestly I don't know a

994
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,829
lot about monster cropping all you gotta

995
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:37,289
do is send me another message and tell

996
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:38,730
me what Monster Crossing is and I'll

997
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:40,170
tell you my opinions on it I'll learn

998
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,829
about it just tell me what's going on

999
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,969
there

1000
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:42,930
I don't know what you mean by monster

1001
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:44,278
cropping there's a couple things that

1002
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:46,588
could mean you could mean a lot by like

1003
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:48,268
snapping the stems and bending them if

1004
00:38:46,588 --> 00:38:50,478
that's what you mean that's cool but it

1005
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:52,858
takes too long for my type of growth ah

1006
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:54,958
number two question he said I was

1007
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:57,690
curious to hear your thoughts on LEDs

1008
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:59,429
any experience using one I don't have

1009
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,958
any personal experience with LEDs so I

1010
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:02,879
don't have a lot to tell you I tell it I

1011
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:05,788
can tell you that it changes the way

1012
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,318
your plants function they use they do

1013
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:09,839
everything they use their nutrients

1014
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:12,599
differently they drink differently I've

1015
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,538
seen friends run side by sides with LEDs

1016
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,219
and HPS lights and the LED plants and

1017
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:19,079
HBS lights looked completely different

1018
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,999
being fed the same thing they

1019
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,130
photosynthesize differently they want

1020
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:24,419
different nutrients it's a whole new

1021
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,219
thing to learn I don't have any

1022
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,499
experience with it personally I can't

1023
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:31,499
guide you on any lights to use I don't

1024
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:34,439
know enough a lot of time researching

1025
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:38,308
light spectrums and their effects on

1026
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,858
plants and I've only seen them really

1027
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:43,920
successfully regularly used as an

1028
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:46,348
auxiliary color augmentation right when

1029
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,209
they're a primary light source every

1030
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:49,709
harvest I've seen has been miniscule

1031
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:51,868
I'll give a shout-out to my friend Nancy

1032
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:54,778
Bud well she grows with a very specific

1033
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:57,719
brand of LED lights and she kills it her

1034
00:39:54,778 --> 00:40:00,958
plants are gorgeous but I've only ever

1035
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:03,900
seen the cheaper ones in action right

1036
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:06,659
never seen like the $1,800 the lights

1037
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,889
did the Nancy are using those lights are

1038
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:10,768
quite expensive they're a thousand to

1039
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:13,348
1400 all our lives but LEDs can be

1040
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:14,968
extremely expensive allegedly you pay

1041
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:16,499
for it in the first year in electrical

1042
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:17,909
savings right what you're gonna save

1043
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,498
yeah you gotta throw it down on the

1044
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:20,489
table to walk out with that light but

1045
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:22,169
you're not gonna have to pay the

1046
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:23,219
electric bill every month like I do with

1047
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,150
my HPS lights

1048
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:25,949
you don't have to run as much

1049
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:29,459
electricity on an air conditioner to

1050
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:30,930
cool it off also there's no saving there

1051
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:34,348
it's just I've never seen them

1052
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:36,419
effectively used alone check out Nancy

1053
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:38,670
bud well on Facebook or Instagram and

1054
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,979
she is a representative for a specific

1055
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,479
lighting company and she has great

1056
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:44,399
pictures and she will guide you through

1057
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:45,358
your purchase of an LED light if it's

1058
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,459
something that you're really interested

1059
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,768
in he's got a third part to this

1060
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:51,538
question it says also wondering what are

1061
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:52,979
your thoughts on happy buckets and deep

1062
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:55,080
water culture what are the

1063
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,199
and cons and your likes and dislikes I

1064
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,849
am not super experienced in deep water

1065
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:02,250
culture do you remember our friend from

1066
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:04,349
Hawaii that dude grew some deep water

1067
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,480
culture buckets and did some great work

1068
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:08,608
the problem was if something goes wrong

1069
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,858
everything goes wrong if your pump goes

1070
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:12,358
out on that deep water culture pump and

1071
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:14,940
you don't spray for three or four hours

1072
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:17,429
if it quits brand all your plants are

1073
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,460
gonna die that's the the major dislike

1074
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:22,559
to it I thought it was awesome our buddy

1075
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,760
had 5-gallon deep water culture buckets

1076
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,710
and his plants were taller than me and

1077
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,200
I'm six foot five and they were putting

1078
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,579
on weight they were packing it up the

1079
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,949
only problem is he had a lot of fungus

1080
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:34,170
gnats all the damn time he could not get

1081
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:35,549
rid of the fungus gnats I've never done

1082
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,930
it myself so I don't have a lot of

1083
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,460
experience but that's what our Hawaiian

1084
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:40,618
friend was experiencing from what I saw

1085
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,409
I spent a lot of time researching

1086
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:45,780
different growth methods and this one

1087
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:47,339
scares me because of its complexity it's

1088
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,310
the same thing with Hydra the more

1089
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,769
complicated it gets the more random

1090
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:55,199
things might fail and cause your crop to

1091
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:57,269
suicide when you were only gone for six

1092
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,699
hours that's why I'm a soil grower and

1093
00:41:57,269 --> 00:42:02,699
honestly soil is insanely forgiving and

1094
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:04,649
part of the reasons for that or what

1095
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:05,759
make me favor it so let's talk about

1096
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,019
deep water culture a little bit because

1097
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,240
there might be people out there going

1098
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:10,949
what the hell's deep water basically

1099
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:12,899
deep water culture is a five gallon

1100
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:14,789
bucket this is just a one you can do

1101
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,050
multiple site deep water culture buckets

1102
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:17,550
and you can have a main bucket that

1103
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,970
feeds or a main reservoir that feeds

1104
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:22,410
multiple buckets but for a one plan deep

1105
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:24,329
water culture bucket you've got a five

1106
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:25,829
gallon bucket and then there's a lid

1107
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:27,569
type device that goes on top of the

1108
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:29,309
bucket but it's got a little mesh basket

1109
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:31,800
cut out of the center of it and you fill

1110
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:34,549
that area with rock wool cubes and you

1111
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,750
put not rock quilty hydroton clay balls

1112
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,250
put your rock your clone that's in a

1113
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,929
rock wall you just set it in there and

1114
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:42,539
then it'll root and the roots will hang

1115
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:45,118
down inside of that 5-gallon bucket

1116
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:46,920
inside that 5-gallon bucket you put a

1117
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,390
sprayer there are a lot of different

1118
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,980
types of sprayers available there are so

1119
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:51,960
many different ways to do it they sell a

1120
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,760
circular it's a circle sprayer that's

1121
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,220
got spray jets this shoots straight up

1122
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,190
and it's kind of a mr. type thing so

1123
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:00,269
you're misting is essentially a long

1124
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:04,740
growth version

1125
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:07,170
yeah it's a real Big Easy cloners those

1126
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:09,239
roots from the bottom real heavily and

1127
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,430
you put nutrients in the water and a lot

1128
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:13,559
of oxygen heavily oxygenated and

1129
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:15,210
nutrient and water spraying from the

1130
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,009
bottom so that those roots hang down

1131
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,599
into that and grow into that spring

1132
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,980
water cuz gravity makes the roots want

1133
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,119
to go down I think gravity does I don't

1134
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,800
know if they just want to go down or if

1135
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,359
it's gravity boss they may just want to

1136
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,740
do it naturally but so the water

1137
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,050
spraying up onto there and it's growing

1138
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:29,609
and then I put it on time on a timer so

1139
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,230
that it stops every once in a while so

1140
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:33,480
the roots can kind of dry so that they

1141
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,730
don't raw then you just keep it cycling

1142
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,530
so every like 15 min every 45 minutes it

1143
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,880
shuts off for 15 now let your water cool

1144
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,490
down so that the pump doesn't overheat

1145
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,869
your water because the oxygen pump and

1146
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:44,219
the [ __ ] moving it pump is gonna make

1147
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:46,400
that water huh a lot of people throw a

1148
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,509
chiller in there to keep that water cool

1149
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,010
it's a lot of work it's a lot of

1150
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,960
technology and if one piece of all that

1151
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:55,530
tech goes wrong your whole thing could

1152
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,300
die yep the production is amazing it the

1153
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:58,800
plant seems to really love it what

1154
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,530
everything's humming but it's one of

1155
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,840
those things where if you're setting it

1156
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:06,450
up the one the one bucket version on the

1157
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,340
cheap like that's the quality of the

1158
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:09,329
parts you just require constant

1159
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,000
attention

1160
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:13,650
and you have to understand that you like

1161
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,650
your plants got a gun to it said the

1162
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:18,860
Hammers [ __ ] one piece fails and that

1163
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:23,010
trigger gets pulled and you start over

1164
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:25,980
period and that's why I read that far in

1165
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:28,680
the book it was like I know enough next

1166
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,909
chapter so sorry I know I couldn't

1167
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:31,289
answer a lot of your questions but at

1168
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:32,789
least I kind of gave you the answers

1169
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:35,250
that I had I don't know a lot about

1170
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:36,809
monster cropping tell me what your you

1171
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,130
think monster cropping means cuz if you

1172
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:40,289
google it there are several different

1173
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,400
takes just cuz it's a that's a very

1174
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:43,349
common word so let me know what you're

1175
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,599
thinking I'll talk more about that

1176
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:47,039
LEDs no experience dude I told you what

1177
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,469
I saw from my friends deep water culture

1178
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,420
we ranted on what I saw from my buddy

1179
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:53,189
called him pineapple Express cuz he's

1180
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,530
from Hawaii I used to come all the time

1181
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,510
but as our 4/20 thanks for the email

1182
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,850
please send me more emails we will talk

1183
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:01,970
more about this stuff on a future

1184
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:01,969
episode

1185
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,000
[Music]

1186
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:07,949
just like he was staring into them I

1187
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,480
know the rigs looking at me do you need

1188
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:12,419
a DAB

1189
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,000
I did already and I think I'm probably

1190
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,070
so good I'm gonna dab the rest of what

1191
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,659
is on this parchment paper this is some

1192
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:21,960
pineapple Jack from our friends at term

1193
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:24,509
X buy last quarter gram that's probably

1194
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,000
quarter gram but I'm gonna take this and

1195
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,410
then I think they want to wrap up the

1196
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,980
show after that Mike got anything

1197
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:34,289
pointing it to say I'm just we're

1198
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,179
gearing up for November make sure you

1199
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:38,759
can do it online most places make sure

1200
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:40,589
you're registered to vote make sure you

1201
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,680
know what election issues are coming up

1202
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:45,930
in your area take a minute to actually

1203
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:48,389
research them it's gonna be a hell of

1204
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:51,809
election all the news is focused on the

1205
00:45:48,389 --> 00:45:53,819
circus that is the presidential race and

1206
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:55,858
honestly it's the local stuff that

1207
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,480
really really really matters that's the

1208
00:45:55,858 --> 00:46:02,250
stuff that's really gonna impact your

1209
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:05,400
day to day and that's the day I did and

1210
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:07,710
that's that's the local issue stuff for

1211
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,530
the the things that tend to really

1212
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:12,019
matter to most people take a minute to

1213
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:16,530
figure out what those are

1214
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:18,900
the local issues are now set County

1215
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,880
voters will be voting on one marijuana

1216
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:23,190
question whether or not they want to ban

1217
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,070
the industry city voters will be voting

1218
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:28,260
on three marijuana questions the first

1219
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:31,230
one do you want to ban the REC industry

1220
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,570
yes or no the second question do you

1221
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:36,179
want to allow recreational stores yes or

1222
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:38,220
no and the third question do you want to

1223
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:42,868
tax those stores is it like four and a

1224
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:45,000
half percent kind of a confusing set of

1225
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:47,550
questions and there's reasons for that

1226
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,500
like a lot of complicated reasons for

1227
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:52,920
all of those three questions and peirong

1228
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,690
for publicity motors but you need to

1229
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,940
know which questions which you need to

1230
00:46:54,690 --> 00:47:01,108
know the wording so that you don't

1231
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,670
accidentally vote the wrong way and it's

1232
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:04,590
important that you know that stuff

1233
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:06,809
regardless of whether you live near me

1234
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,670
or not because whatever the issues are

1235
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:09,630
in your area they will impact you

1236
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,400
personally

1237
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,960
make sure you know what's up and make

1238
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,759
sure you vote have you gone to your

1239
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,338
Facebook page your Pueblo for sensible

1240
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:19,318
cannabis laws Facebook page and kind of

1241
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:21,900
typed in guidance on which way to vote

1242
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:24,239
since it is worded awkwardly there's

1243
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,369
already a beautiful infographic that

1244
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,318
helps with that the pueblos pulp did

1245
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:32,309
they've been doing some amazing cannabis

1246
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:35,358
John Rodriguez Lisa wheeler and I don't

1247
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:37,829
know the other reporters name okay

1248
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,119
thanks Lisa wheeler and your colleague

1249
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:42,900
who are helping us out in the cannabis

1250
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,910
fight not so much that it's just doing

1251
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,358
solid honest reporting and when that's

1252
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:50,759
done it leans far to the pro cannabis

1253
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:52,739
side because that's just the reality you

1254
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:57,778
can't be a good reporter it not end up

1255
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:59,788
reporting that truth but know the issues

1256
00:47:57,778 --> 00:48:01,798
in your area it's not that difficult

1257
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:03,539
doesn't take that much time and it's

1258
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:05,699
incredibly important folks get out and

1259
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:06,960
do it Mike always knows what's up he's

1260
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:08,278
always got the right thing to say if

1261
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,470
you're listening and you're in the

1262
00:48:08,278 --> 00:48:12,420
industry you should think about some

yeah

1471
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:26,089
back for the podcast with Jesse finally

1472
00:59:19,009 --> 00:59:27,980
this is a first like 50 and I think

1473
00:59:26,088 --> 00:59:30,828
you're both here for those yeah I think

1474
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:35,420
we did one before too as I met you at

1475
00:59:30,829 --> 00:59:36,980
the stable of doing a podcast completely

1476
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:39,710
it's hard to remember some of those

1477
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,449
early earlier right there for him I had

1478
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:49,059
people remind me of things I've said and

1479
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:55,338
done on those episodes the first

1480
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:57,619
meaningful one this is episode 149 you

1481
00:59:55,338 --> 00:59:59,210
guys a hundred and forty nine episodes

1482
00:59:57,619 --> 01:00:01,009
into this podcast I haven't missed a

1483
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:03,259
week in two and a half years every month

1484
01:00:01,009 --> 01:00:08,900
as a podcast to listen to in some

1485
01:00:03,259 --> 01:00:16,068
Thursday's it's been incredible episodes

1486
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:18,680
I call it a swap cast I learned the

1487
01:00:16,068 --> 01:00:20,538
phrase swap cast from Doug Stanhope but

1488
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:22,578
when two podcasters come together and

1489
01:00:20,539 --> 01:00:23,720
record one podcast and then they both

1490
01:00:22,579 --> 01:00:25,369
put it up on their feed so that

1491
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:27,348
everybody gets exposed to both shows at

1492
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:28,789
the same time I did one of those with

1493
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:30,380
the Colorado a podcast make sure you

1494
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:31,940
check it out it was good fun it's a

1495
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,680
little bit of chaos but it is a great

1496
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,809
show listen to it on their feed so that

1497
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:36,440
they get to click so you guys know the

1498
01:00:35,809 --> 01:00:37,910
Colorado

1499
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,619
podcast page and listen to that episode

1500
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:42,618
on their feed because they can use the

1501
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:44,630
traffic we host em up we've got some

1502
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:46,019
internet problems there's some website

1503
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:49,298
problems at the moment

1504
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:50,829

time that's [ __ ] to try to do there

1535

a band granny's first podcast and she

1539

wasn't sure how to go about it right

1540
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,789
away so now she is completely [ __ ]

1541
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,500
comfortable and she knows what to do on

1542
01:01:57,789 --> 01:02:01,539
a podcast so it was a practice run you

1543

1544
01:02:01,539 --> 01:02:04,510

1545
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:05,679
karma to land on us that's not a bad

1546
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,730

1547
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:08,318
yeah all right we're gonna talk about

1548
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:09,608
how you're growing guys I wanna talk

1549
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:11,048
about these dabs it's distillate and

1550
01:02:09,608 --> 01:02:13,630
these Terps no bro you showed up with

1551
01:02:11,048 --> 01:02:15,759
some delicious [ __ ] Jessie remind me

1552
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:19,660
what's in each of these little vials you

1553
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,230
got here critical mass critical mass

1554
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:24,098
Terps

1555
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:30,519
just to the rod distillate this is the

1556
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:32,048
VM to the garden of Weeden for an

1557
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:33,759
amazing breeding project that was his

1558
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:38,190
first run Chuck in pollen and those

1559
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,190
[ __ ] that strain came out amazing I

1560
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:45,298
don't know how much he's growing it out

1561
01:02:42,068 --> 01:02:45,298
but I could tell him a little about it

1562
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:53,480
[Music]

1563
01:02:50,389 --> 01:02:55,279
girl gorilla glue rock terms so you guys

1564
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,440
they have figured out how to take a

1565
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,820
plant a cannabis plant probably takes

1566
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,039
more than one plant to take a large

1567
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:03,590
batch of cannabis and extract of the

1568
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,509
terpenoids from that specific batch that

1569
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:08,090
one plant and then you can get the

1570
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:09,950
essence the flavor the aroma the taste

1571
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:17,860
it all in your face and all in your

1572
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:17,859
palate and it's amazing overwhelming

1573
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:21,709
[Music]

1574
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,090
okay really overwhelming I really think

1575
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:40,519
the terpenes are really contributing to

1576
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:42,950
my high also it makes me skyrocket to

1577
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:44,300
that next level that became crystal

1578
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:46,759
clear what I started playing with the

1579
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:52,340
distillate in the Terps it's you're

1580
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:55,070
taking the same THC but when you add the

1581
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:56,630
critical mass you go one way hard when

1582
01:03:55,070 --> 01:04:00,019
you add it to something like the Durbin

1583
01:03:56,630 --> 01:04:02,420
you know the other way we are and you're

1584
01:04:00,019 --> 01:04:04,369
not changing the THC content right it's

1585
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:06,920
the other parts of the plant that really

1586
01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:09,769
shaped that that entourage effects in

1587
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,630
effect what Gupta talked about it's

1588
01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:13,639
exactly evident and when we're using the

1589
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:14,869
Terps like this yeah dude good job

1590
01:04:13,639 --> 01:04:16,339
you're kind of your company's

1591
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:17,630
experimenting give your company a shout

1592
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,610
out so we can hype them up a little bit

1593
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:21,260
the Uncle Bud company the Uncle Bud

1594
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:22,789
company based in Pueblo Colorado you

1595
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,950
guys we were pulling raw Terps out here

1596
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:28,670
in Pueblo Colorado can I have no - you

1597
01:04:24,949 --> 01:04:33,199
know zero th-these terpenoids zero - lab

1598
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:34,670
proven so these it would not be

1599
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:37,159
hypothetically I'm not gonna do this

1600
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:38,750
don't [ __ ] ask hypothetically we could

1601
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:40,909
make these available nationwide because

1602
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:44,329
there are no cannabinoids in there yes

1603
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:45,559
awesome diverting it out of metric is a

1604
01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:48,139
whole nother story

1605
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:49,730
right right making them so it's it's

1606
01:04:48,139 --> 01:04:52,009
virtually impossible for that to leave

1607
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:53,990
the Colorado marijuana enforcement

1608
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:55,790
tracking system that is stuck you're not

1609
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:58,819
gonna get it you guys well how does it

1610
01:04:55,789 --> 01:04:59,679
concern once you once if you purchase it

1611
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:02,590
in a store

1612
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:05,919
if there's no THC they can't travel yes

1613
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:07,150
I would yes that was also my because

1614
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:18,730
there's nothing that's terpenoids

1615
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:20,380
terpenoids theoretically it's also legal

1616
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:23,619
to ship in the mail I wasn't gonna go

1617
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:25,420
there but yeah theoretically since it's

1618
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:37,000
just trippin toys I mean you can buy

1619
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:39,070
toys folks but if there's really no THC

1620
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,750
in it I think there's a loop here to be

1621
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:42,460
played with it's necessary there's

1622
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:44,530
actually might got too hot there's a

1623
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,610
website called just chirps calm or

1624
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:47,470
something similar to that where you can

1625
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:49,269
purchase terpenoids you can buy limonene

1626
01:05:47,469 --> 01:05:50,799
you can buy all of the terpenoids

1627
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:53,860
separately is that the big pretty wheel

1628
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,360
I've seen probably but those turps are

1629
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,980
not derived from cannabis those are

1630
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:59,829
pulled from things like bananas and

1631
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:02,230
roses and oranges and other fruits this

1632
01:05:59,829 --> 01:06:04,389
is just the terms and you would people

1633
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:06,039
that are not able to smoke this quality

1634
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:07,659
cannabis would be able they'd have to

1635
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:09,610
get some dabs or some distillate or

1636
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:11,529
something to carry it you can probably

1637
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:13,360
put this in it like a vape pen cartridge

1638
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:18,250
you can mix that up with some VG some

1639
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:26,380
vegetable glycol or something yes it's

1640
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:28,030
actually pretty amazing it makes a vapor

1641
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:30,220
and then you can actually taste gorilla

1642
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:32,590
glue you could taste this ovm you could

1643
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:34,149
taste the critical mass you could taste

1644
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:37,269
I've got ghost train haze over here I

1645

1652
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:55,070

amazing I had oh gee cush chirps there's

1654
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:59,390
paradism Terps floating around here

1655
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:00,800
somewhere it's so delicious to taste

1656
01:06:59,389 --> 01:07:05,629
these cannabis terpenes we're getting

1657
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:08,720
spoiled it's actually it's really not

1658
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:12,019
that hard to extract them either it's

1659
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:13,250
just yeah I was gonna say tell us what

1660
01:07:12,019 --> 01:07:14,599
you feel comfortable sharing I don't

1661
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,650
want to prior too much information out

1662
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:18,369
of you but if there's something you want

1663
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:21,829
to tell us that some of your process

1664
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:23,358
I'll tell you this if you get with me

1665
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:25,670
and give me 100 bucks we'll walk you

1666
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:28,369
through the entire process 100 bucks I

1667
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:34,369
can even I've already proven I can do it

1668
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:37,220
Rasta SAP how to do our consulting fee

1669
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:41,000
just for showing up from Shirdi bucks it

1670
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:44,569
takes it takes an investment in

1671
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:47,300
equipment the equipment cost for a small

1672
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:49,430
operation so maybe I had five pounds of

1673
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,930
plant material to run how much equipment

1674
01:07:49,429 --> 01:07:52,519
should I buy what would I be spending

1675
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:54,588
for a five pound run

1676
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:57,800
yeah did equipment you're looking about

1677
01:07:54,588 --> 01:08:00,139
600 bucks and you're gonna be doing five

1678
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,030
runs instead of one five pounder okay

1679
01:08:00,139 --> 01:08:20,539
well so about a pound at a time and it's

1680
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:22,130
600 bucks in I don't care it's a solvent

1681
01:08:20,539 --> 01:08:25,369
list process completely and totally

1682
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:29,060
organic it takes a little bit of a

1683
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:30,769
chemistry background or or you just need

1684
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:32,690
to know someone who can walk you through

1685
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:34,850
the process it's a back until it's all

1686
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:37,629
right between you and Bret maverick I

1687
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:41,000
should be able to figure it out oh yeah

1688
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:43,250
yeah I mean I taught em how to do it

1689
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,170
okay so that's the Rasta SAP also by the

1690
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:47,670
way yeah

1691
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:49,199
I don't know if I'm ready to answer your

1692
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:54,810
Facebook messages yet robust shout out

1693
01:08:49,198 --> 01:09:00,389
on the show I'm just not ready to

1694
01:08:54,810 --> 01:09:02,819
interact on the show because jesse is my

1695
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:03,390
outdoor expert it's a lot of pressure on

1696
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:28,589
you bro

1697
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:29,789
my outdoor expert the Pokemon go buddy

1698
01:09:28,588 --> 01:09:37,469
it's time to take some notes about the

1699
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:39,420
Gro probably about three weeks in to

1700
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:41,338
flower you should start seeing the

1701
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,409
pistols the calyx pistols are starting

1702
01:09:41,338 --> 01:09:44,880
to form on your plants those little you

1703
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:46,349
guys call them hares the white hairs

1704
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,900
those are popping up on your plants if

1705
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:50,279
you've got girls those are popping up

1706
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:53,698
something super important and

1707
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:55,350
hypercritical your boy plants need to be

1708
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:56,939
[ __ ] pulled by now walk through your

1709
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:58,770
garden look for boys look for

1710
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:01,469
hermaphrodites get rid of that [ __ ]

1711
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:03,480
because how far can paul and travel at

1712
01:10:01,469 --> 01:10:06,000
least four miles or so it's very first

1713
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:07,579
yeah I don't I don't want everybody's

1714
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,079
crop getting pollinated because your

1715
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:11,279
excuse me I just a full solid burp on

1716
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:12,689
the podcast I was read I don't need

1717
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:14,609
everybody's crop getting pollinated

1718
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:16,079
because you're too lazy to pull a male

1719
01:10:14,609 --> 01:10:17,549
plant out of your garden so go outside

1720
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:19,140
hold the male plants if you haven't

1721
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:20,489
already done it you might be [ __ ] up

1722
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,739
already I talked about it on another

1723
01:10:20,488 --> 01:10:24,629
episode of how quickly male plants drop

1724
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:27,119
pollen I've got a male plant another

1725
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:28,920
room right over there he is like 15 days

1726
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:31,469
in and he has just blast and fallen

1727
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:33,060
right now so it only takes 15 or 16 days

1728
01:10:31,469 --> 01:10:36,810
for serious trouble to start happening

1729
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:38,280
yep doesn't take long I've actually I've

1730
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:42,650
known as a mature breeder that

1731
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:46,340
pollinated his neighbor's screw that was

1732
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:50,089
let's save 400 500 feet away oh man

1733
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:51,319
with with trees fences houses all kinds

1734
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:53,239
of pollen it's amazing

1735
01:10:51,319 --> 01:10:54,829
yeah that's its whole purpose of life is

1736
01:10:53,238 --> 01:10:58,329
to just land on the female plant and

1737
01:10:54,829 --> 01:11:00,649
climb up that pistol and get up in there

1738
01:10:58,329 --> 01:11:03,170
there's a couple of places that have

1739
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:05,899
passed special rules keeping hemp and

1740
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:07,730
marijuana grows like five or six miles

1741
01:11:05,899 --> 01:11:15,769
away just to make sure that there's

1742
01:11:07,729 --> 01:11:19,698
never I totally know a solution to that

1743
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:22,790
I would I would grow my sensimilla of

1744
01:11:19,698 --> 01:11:24,229
grow right next to em field are you

1745
01:11:22,789 --> 01:11:26,420
willing to expose your secret on the

1746
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:28,129
podcast I think I know you told me the

1747
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:29,029
way you told me we tell us on the show

1748
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:30,800
or do you have to keep that a secret

1749
01:11:29,029 --> 01:11:32,809
hemp plants only pollinate once a year

1750
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:38,380
or they only release pollen once a year

1751
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:43,099
okay so plan your your your bloom cycles

1752
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:45,440
accordingly if you can yeah but also

1753
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:47,690
most Tim crows like to grow clones

1754
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:49,549
there's significant other ways you can

1755
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:50,809
protect your own grow from the next the

1756
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:52,360
guy next door who doesn't know the

1757
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:55,039
difference between a male and a female

1758
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:56,329
you just gotta it's part of the planning

1759
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:58,310
in the research you should have done by

1760
01:11:56,329 --> 01:11:59,719
now or he should have done he should not

1761
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:01,429
have a male out there outside in the

1762
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:02,989
first place I actually know a couple

1763
01:12:01,429 --> 01:12:04,699
breeders in California to do everything

1764
01:12:02,988 --> 01:12:09,589
outdoors and I just shake my head's at

1765
01:12:04,698 --> 01:12:11,059
them getting bugs right about now you'll

1766
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:12,139
start seeing the bud sites it's time to

1767
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:16,730
get in there and kind of take off that

1768
01:12:12,139 --> 01:12:17,840
lower [ __ ] yes shave the legs in there

1769
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:19,250
you guys get in there and clean off all

1770
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,690
the lower canopy where the air is not

1771
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,219
getting in something we're like a little

1772
01:12:20,689 --> 01:12:23,479
squirrel could get help climbing up the

1773
01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:25,189
little ladder at the bottom take that

1774
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:27,348
off of there all that stuff that's gonna

1775
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:29,329
hang down and touch the dirt get get rid

1776
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:31,610
of that all those little sucker branches

1777
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:33,349
just a little thin pale yellow branches

1778
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:34,908
that are just shooting up take all those

1779
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,920
off you don't need those go clean up the

1780
01:12:34,908 --> 01:12:38,149
inside a little bit you want to focus on

1781
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,739
the tops of the plants that's where all

1782
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:42,019
the magic is gonna happen so clean them

1783
01:12:39,738 --> 01:12:43,428
up a little bit follow them out yeah

1784
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,780
hollow them out a little bit pull them

1785
01:12:43,429 --> 01:12:46,219
apart and spread them if you can if you

1786
01:12:44,779 --> 01:12:47,719
need to get a giant stick and stick it

1787
01:12:46,219 --> 01:12:49,069
in the dirt and pull one branch this way

1788
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:50,239
in one branch this way so that they're

1789
01:12:49,069 --> 01:12:51,590
getting Sun properly

1790
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:52,809
feel free to do it they could take a

1791
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:55,090
beating

1792
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:56,800
out into your grill around noon one

1793
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:59,590
o'clock when the Sun is really high in

1794
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:02,230
the sky and everything that's not

1795
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:07,000
getting direct sunlight right then and

1796
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:08,949
there you know that's that kind of use

1797
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,470
that as a guide of what to take off so

1798
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:14,470
it's you know I mean not everything's

1799
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:15,850
gonna be getting full sunlight but you

1800
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:18,010
know things that are just in the dark

1801
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:20,200
you know at the bottom you know you can

1802
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:22,510
take that off things that are you know a

1803
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:24,300
little further down the side or bud

1804
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:26,560
sites that are further down the side

1805
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,909
they may not be getting full sunlight

1806
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,670
but they're still getting sunlight leave

1807
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:32,979
those there so you know just judge

1808
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:36,219
accordingly but all that all that dark

1809
01:13:32,979 --> 01:13:38,078
stuff you definitely take that off

1810
01:13:36,219 --> 01:13:39,219
that's gonna be Laura fee yeah yeah you

1811
01:13:38,078 --> 01:13:40,389
don't want to turn that and unless

1812
01:13:39,219 --> 01:13:41,708
you're making a bunch of hash that I

1813
01:13:40,389 --> 01:13:43,449
mean maybe you leave that if you want to

1814
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:46,899
but it's gonna take the energy up top

1815
01:13:43,448 --> 01:13:48,728
yeah so stretch phase should be just

1816
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:50,319
about over right we've about the first

1817
01:13:48,729 --> 01:13:52,090
three weeks we really start stretching

1818
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:53,438
that should be slowing down now so we

1819
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:55,418
can see kind of how big our plants are

1820
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:56,559
actually gonna be gonna get a judgment

1821
01:13:55,418 --> 01:14:00,300
of how tall they're gonna be how much

1822
01:13:56,559 --> 01:14:00,300
panicking you need to do on readjusting

1823
01:14:01,529 --> 01:14:05,139
yeah well people are growing crazy

1824
01:14:03,578 --> 01:14:08,049
outdoor plants here in Pueblo and it's

1825
01:14:05,139 --> 01:14:08,979
completely illegal is bad but there are

1826
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:10,840
people that are doing it there's

1827
01:14:08,979 --> 01:14:23,499
building a higher fence every week I see

1828
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:25,569
them like giant TV sets you guys there

1829
01:14:23,498 --> 01:14:27,069
it's gonna be all over Pueblo you guys

1830
01:14:25,569 --> 01:14:28,299
sure drawing outdoors this year and

1831
01:14:27,069 --> 01:14:30,158
someone tries to steal your [ __ ] don't

1832
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:32,110
[ __ ] shoot them grow more weed next

1833
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:34,688
year do we have to do this episode every

1834
01:14:32,109 --> 01:14:35,799
year but just it's just we just it's

1835
01:14:34,689 --> 01:14:37,269
happened here though somebody got shot

1836
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,248
trying to steal somebody's cannabis

1837
01:14:37,269 --> 01:14:41,050
outdoors and that medicine that was

1838
01:14:39,248 --> 01:14:42,609
supposed to be medicine became a target

1839
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:44,288
of theft which became an attempted

1840
01:14:42,609 --> 01:14:45,728
homicide which [ __ ] that we don't need

1841
01:14:44,288 --> 01:14:47,288
that vibe attached to this plant at all

1842
01:14:45,729 --> 01:14:49,539
that's why we tried to make it legal

1843
01:14:47,288 --> 01:14:51,219
that's why we wanted safely accessible

1844
01:14:49,538 --> 01:14:53,168
so nobody's getting shot over the [ __ ]

1845
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:55,748
we took it away from the cartels but in

1846
01:14:53,168 --> 01:14:58,868
the hands of the medical community yes

1847
01:14:55,748 --> 01:15:06,248
it is not justifiable it instantly makes

1848
01:14:58,868 --> 01:15:09,458
it into criminal you're protecting your

1849
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:10,478
illegal crop anybody please guys if

1850
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:12,458
you're listening to this you're probably

1851
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:13,749
not gonna shoot me you know peaceful

1852
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:14,908
cool ass people is why you're listening

1853
01:15:13,748 --> 01:15:16,688
to my show

1854
01:15:14,908 --> 01:15:19,509
you're gonna start seeing what size

1855
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:21,340
plants are don't pop don't top anymore

1856
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:22,689
that's one of the next things I had

1857
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:24,130
written down is no more topping the

1858
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:25,719
hormones and the plants have all decided

1859
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:27,279
where the tops of those plants are gonna

1860
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:28,630
be and where they need to bake it's the

1861
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:30,219
most energy where they need to send the

1862
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:32,409
THC where they need to send all the

1863
01:15:30,219 --> 01:15:33,819
energy for budding quit topping them no

1864
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:35,978
more topping you can kind of bend them

1865
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:37,658
you can stretch them down but don't cut

1866
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:39,519
any more off the tops of the plant so

1867
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:41,078
you take all that bottom [ __ ] freely but

1868
01:15:39,519 --> 01:15:43,329
the tops where the hormones have climbed

1869
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:46,569
up don't take that off of there no more

1870
01:15:43,328 --> 01:15:48,399
topping is it time now to adjust the

1871
01:15:46,569 --> 01:15:52,000
nutrients that were feeding them

1872
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:53,948
for sure probably you know especially by

1873
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,819
the time this comes out but yeah last

1874
01:15:53,948 --> 01:15:58,619
week

1875
01:15:54,819 --> 01:16:01,119
most definitely now but yeah go for it

1876
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:04,408
we can put this out we can put this out

1877
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:06,939
Monday morning out outdoor plants

1878
01:16:04,408 --> 01:16:08,679
they'll use a little more nitrogen then

1879
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:11,678
indoor plants will through the bloom

1880
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:13,690
cycle so keep that in mind you know keep

1881
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:17,619
that bottle of bloom or I mean bottle

1882
01:16:13,689 --> 01:16:19,629
grow around the way I do it is I'd

1883
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:21,760
probably just if I felt they needed a

1884
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:24,760
little extra nitrogen shot I just mix up

1885
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:28,539
some some grow and maybe a little cow

1886
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:30,850
milk and feed that in addition to the

1887
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:33,189
normal fee okay so add it on top of

1888
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:35,710
normally feeding you know I saw sub cool

1889
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:37,750
take a bottle of nutrients and pour it

1890
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:42,850
directly onto the soil on his outdoor

1891
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:45,819
grow and then just watered it in like so

1892
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:47,260
cool really did that bro like one of the

1893
01:16:45,819 --> 01:16:49,210
most reputable growers you could find on

1894
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:51,060
the Internet and they dude just poured a

1895
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:53,679
bottle of a nutrient I won't even use

1896
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:55,300
straight onto the dirt and then watered

1897
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,100
it in just fine

1898
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:59,770
you know sub cools kind of kind of from

1899
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:07,210
south a little bit flavor to him so he

1900
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:08,679
doesn't give to just the feet he might

1901
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:09,698
want to keep Jessie made a really good

1902
01:17:08,679 --> 01:17:11,050
point that I didn't think about these

1903
01:17:09,698 --> 01:17:12,579
outdoor plants are gonna use a little

1904
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:14,529
more nitrogen than what we're used to so

1905
01:17:12,579 --> 01:17:16,539
increase your nitrogen feed if you're

1906
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:18,460
not gonna be a bottle fed nutrient kind

1907
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:20,109
of guy what kind of stuff can we add to

1908
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:26,529
top dress to get a little more nitrogen

1909
01:17:20,109 --> 01:17:29,198
yeah now we're talking some neem ill see

1910
01:17:26,529 --> 01:17:32,109
bird guano's a great all-purpose guano

1911
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:34,479
if if that's your thing

1912
01:17:32,109 --> 01:17:37,448
I've quit using it but I had a [ __ ] ton

1913
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:39,309
of it so it's not going anywhere I gotta

1914
01:17:37,448 --> 01:17:43,299
use it up I'm just not gonna buy anymore

1915
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:45,969
but seabird guano gives you PK and

1916
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:47,469
nitrogen so it's a real good one there's

1917
01:17:45,969 --> 01:17:50,020
something about whatever they're eating

1918
01:17:47,469 --> 01:17:52,000
the the fish and the kelp that's in that

1919
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:54,070
I think that really adds to the flavor

1920
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,260
and the funky smell of a good cushy but

1921
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:57,529
I think kelp and seabird guano really

1922
01:17:56,260 --> 01:18:00,170
contribute

1923
01:17:57,529 --> 01:18:02,359
other ocean products may make the best

1924
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:05,060
tasting blood of my pantry I've done

1925
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:08,179
began acai have done you know the blown

1926
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:11,060
bone mills and blood mills I'm

1927
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:16,400
everything and that's I love my little

1928
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:19,400
my ocean style you know kelp and crab

1929
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:22,579
shell mill seabird guano works good with

1930
01:18:19,399 --> 01:18:26,259
it yeah it's I like the product SEAPLEX

1931
01:18:22,579 --> 01:18:29,539
from organic hair definitely as it's a

1932
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:31,310
cold-pressed blue algae based product

1933
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:32,869
product and it makes I think it makes

1934
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:35,210
the buds taste better smell better they

1935
01:18:32,869 --> 01:18:36,710
get more density and I think there's

1936
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,659
something else in there that just makes

1937
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:40,250
them grow better whatever is happening

1938
01:18:38,659 --> 01:18:42,260
in that kelp that life that's in that

1939
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:45,189
kill makes my plants happier hey

1940
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:47,510
definitely a little boost helps the

1941
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:49,699
fastest growing plant on the face of the

1942
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:52,789
planet so yeah there's all kinds of

1943
01:18:49,699 --> 01:18:53,679
natural PD yards going on there ok it

1944
01:18:52,789 --> 01:19:09,109
works

1945
01:18:53,680 --> 01:19:10,850
yes auxins and cytokinins yeah stuff is

1946
01:19:09,109 --> 01:19:14,869
not for everybody so here's a quick

1947
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:18,980
little kelp kelp is also a great bloom

1948
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:21,109
booster so you can take kelp take put it

1949
01:19:18,979 --> 01:19:23,299
in a mason say quart mason jar put a cup

1950
01:19:21,109 --> 01:19:27,489
of kelp in there go ahead and top it off

1951
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:30,440
with water let it rehydrate for 24 hours

1952
01:19:27,489 --> 01:19:33,739
strain any extra water away if there is

1953
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:36,439
a little bit run that kelp through your

1954
01:19:33,739 --> 01:19:40,699
food processor and that'll turn it into

1955
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:42,589
just a mush at that point you can it

1956
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:45,079
dissolves into water and you can follow

1957
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:46,850
your spray it as a bloom booster right

1958
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:50,569
there on your plant and then store it in

1959
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:52,789
your refrigerator in the back keep it as

1960
01:19:50,569 --> 01:19:55,219
cold as possible so it'll definitely

1961
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:57,219
make your plants happy would you add any

1962
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:59,679
fulvic acid to that spray

1963
01:19:57,219 --> 01:20:01,719
that wouldn't hurt a bit but make it a

1964
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:04,389
little more absorbable that's probably

1965
01:20:01,719 --> 01:20:06,480
the recipe to a lot of organic boosters

1966
01:20:04,389 --> 01:20:07,920
and them are why they're alive yeah

1967
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:11,288
[Music]

1968
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:13,630
brain has got Kelvin acid naturally and

1969
01:20:11,288 --> 01:20:15,670
kelp like that the silic acid comes in

1970
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:18,368
there's a little bit but most of that or

1971
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:20,229
the big source of that is aloe vera

1972
01:20:18,368 --> 01:20:22,929
that's really popular right now you

1973
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:26,260
could easily add some aloe vera into

1974
01:20:22,929 --> 01:20:43,239
that and that's am I actually going to

1975
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:44,619
do that let's really see back in the day

1976
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:46,178
we were taught not to take too many

1977
01:20:44,618 --> 01:20:47,439
notes because if your door got kicked in

1978
01:20:46,179 --> 01:20:49,118
and there were notes it said feed on

1979
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:50,348
week six feet on week seven you just

1980
01:20:49,118 --> 01:20:52,058
left a paper trail in your handwriting

1981
01:20:50,349 --> 01:20:53,739
you had to have those plants in there

1982
01:20:52,059 --> 01:20:56,590
with no [ __ ] notes in a good memory

1983
01:20:53,738 --> 01:20:59,558
yep yeah it was harder that time at that

1984
01:20:56,590 --> 01:21:01,449
time so many things changed in

1985
01:20:59,559 --> 01:21:03,550
legalization and that's just one of the

1986
01:21:01,448 --> 01:21:07,748
really nice ones that she not everyone

1987
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:09,880
even gets to see [ __ ] I was scared to

1988
01:21:07,748 --> 01:21:12,069
look at it on the internet even like

1989
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:14,800
even to Google or back then it was like

1990
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:18,399
Yahoo or American were you part of overt

1991
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:20,288
over drug calm I was way too scared to

1992
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:22,569
ever ask questions or post on it but I

1993
01:21:20,288 --> 01:21:24,728
totally read totally told it all right

1994
01:21:22,569 --> 01:21:26,259
yeah I used to go look and all that good

1995
01:21:24,729 --> 01:21:28,420
stuff I used to make up fake accounts on

1996
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:31,748
other sites and just go look like I was

1997
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:33,880
supposed to be like cannabis culture

1998
01:21:31,748 --> 01:21:35,710
magazine had a really good one too after

1999
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:38,750
they shut down over girl a lot of the

2000
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:42,529
people from there went and that's

2001
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:44,420
I got into the forums years later when I

2002
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:46,369
got my med card I was like [ __ ] this but

2003
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:49,010
once I had my med cards game the [ __ ] on

2004
01:21:46,369 --> 01:21:51,319
yeah I think and a lot of people may

2005
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:55,070
argue with me I think that the OG Kush

2006
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:57,229
the og and OG Kush could be og from

2007
01:21:55,069 --> 01:21:59,059
overgrow calm cuz if you met somebody

2008
01:21:57,229 --> 01:22:00,919
from overgrow they'd say are you [ __ ]

2009
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:02,150
Jesse from og and you wouldn't because

2010
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,440
you wouldn't want to say overdrove

2011
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:13,339
because if it wasn't you then I mean I

2012
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:15,229
just [ __ ] up like from what I think

2013
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:18,020
that people were shipping seeds around

2014
01:22:15,229 --> 01:22:19,429
like one guy had a seed he's some of

2015
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:20,840
them to Jesse and then Jesse grew him

2016
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:22,100
and found the phenotype he liked and

2017
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,449
bred to that and then shipped those

2018
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,770
seeds to somebody and I think that

2019
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:34,250
somebody ended up with the bag of seeds

2020
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:37,460
and they call it to overgrow cush I mean

2021
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:38,659
that's adapt Jase you know of another

2022
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:42,710
one I've heard okay

2023
01:22:38,659 --> 01:22:46,250
that's that one and then the one that

2024
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:48,710
involves the bubba kush guy yeah Matt

2025
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:50,390
from Florida that's kind of the same I

2026
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:51,619
mean it kind of falls in there but

2027
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:54,710
that's the - I tend to believe

2028
01:22:51,619 --> 01:22:56,569
personally okay there are plenty of

2029
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:57,890
other stories of how that happened I

2030
01:22:56,569 --> 01:23:00,769
don't even bring up the podcast that

2031
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:03,800
I've heard them on the oh geez I have I

2032
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:05,630
yeah I love oh gee I love some good OG

2033
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,980
my Jeff's og has got some flavor to it

2034
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:08,180
there would be some Jeff's og available

2035
01:23:06,979 --> 01:23:09,949
on the shelf at the store pretty soon

2036
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:11,360
here that John Randall's junior trimmed

2037
01:23:09,949 --> 01:23:13,729
up for us it looks delicious

2038
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:16,809
so we're top dressing with nitrogen

2039
01:23:13,729 --> 01:23:20,329
heavy products how about some ha I mean

2040
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:21,830
Adam in there yeah alright but don't go

2041
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:24,109
to art yeah you want to hit hard with

2042
01:23:21,829 --> 01:23:26,899
your your P's and K's peas and K's now

2043
01:23:24,109 --> 01:23:29,149
yeah I remember it takes a week to two

2044
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:30,329
weeks on a typical top dress for it to

2045
01:23:29,149 --> 01:23:35,099
break down enough

2046
01:23:30,329 --> 01:23:37,590
to be um uptake above like the plant so

2047
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:40,430
Rick plan ahead and you know that's if

2048
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:43,800
you do it right now we're in the morning

2049
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:45,450
whatever it is you know that's not gonna

2050
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:49,860
really take effect for at least a week

2051
01:23:45,449 --> 01:23:51,989
so think about that plan is already

2052
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:54,059
yellowing you're chasing it by now yeah

2053
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:56,849
yeah see you sure you should have done

2054
01:23:54,060 --> 01:24:00,960
more nitrogen already so next year do

2055
01:23:56,850 --> 01:24:02,760
more yeah and I would still add nitrogen

2056
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,109
to keep it from getting worse and

2057
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:06,780
that'll help your buds develop it'll

2058
01:24:04,109 --> 01:24:08,880
keep everything moving all right other

2059
01:24:06,779 --> 01:24:12,269
top dresses though knee mill is a

2060
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:15,720
favorite of mine Crabb mill is good for

2061
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:17,280
blooming and then kelp I mean most

2062
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,829
organic bloom boosters are made out of

2063
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:21,689
kelp so that's really where you want to

2064
01:24:19,829 --> 01:24:24,750
go do you mess with the Quran Jamil oh

2065
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:28,619
yeah yeah it's the neem a lime mix I use

2066
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:30,689
it's okay great mix that'll keep most

2067
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:32,729
bugs out of the soil those bugs off the

2068
01:24:30,689 --> 01:24:33,809
plants and you'll never notice it when

2069
01:24:32,729 --> 01:24:36,329
the finished product

2070
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:37,650
alright so let's talk about defoliating

2071
01:24:36,329 --> 01:24:39,119
because at this point of the season it's

2072
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:41,489
time to clean up a bunch of the leaves

2073
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:50,340
do you like to heavily defoliate or do

2074
01:24:41,489 --> 01:24:52,409
you just kind of clean them up I'll take

2075
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:53,730
off a lot of leaves to where people look

2076
01:24:52,409 --> 01:24:55,229
at you like you're crazy but then they

2077
01:24:53,729 --> 01:24:56,489
come back a week ten days later and all

2078
01:24:55,229 --> 01:25:02,129
the leaves are back and they can't even

2079
01:24:56,489 --> 01:25:04,769
tell on this year I've got three of the

2080
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:06,510
same strains planted in a row so the one

2081
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:08,670
in the middle they're all about the same

2082
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:13,230
size the one's gonna get tortured yeah

2083
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:15,359
let's do you have Northern Lights or the

2084
01:25:13,229 --> 01:25:17,189
lights number five the cut that goes

2085
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:18,899
around doing four shops quite a bit that

2086
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:20,460
the one that spends bread - yeah nice

2087
01:25:18,899 --> 01:25:22,739
it's a good cut I had that for a little

2088
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:24,720
bit that's the code I made uh my grape

2089
01:25:22,739 --> 01:25:26,699
og with - oh that's a great guy you make

2090
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:29,070
some donkey dicks for buds for sure

2091
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:31,079
yeah make some huge huge [ __ ] buds

2092
01:25:29,069 --> 01:25:33,389
alright so D Foley you guys clean up in

2093
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:35,189
there basically any leaf that looks like

2094
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:36,570
it's gonna be blocking a bud site from

2095
01:25:35,189 --> 01:25:37,859
getting sunlight just go ahead and pull

2096
01:25:36,569 --> 01:25:39,420
that [ __ ] off and it's gonna grow back

2097
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:40,960
because it's an outdoor plant and you're

2098
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:43,029
gonna be amazed at how quickly

2099
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,439
leaves grow back you'll pull off a leaf

2100
01:25:43,029 --> 01:25:45,819
the size of your hand and in ten days

2101
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:49,239
you'll have one back bigger than your

2102
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:51,549
head it is grow and grow they love the

2103
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:52,809
outdoors all right so we've talked about

2104
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:55,029
feeding a little bit we talked a little

2105
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:57,580
bit about top dressing we talked about

2106
01:25:55,029 --> 01:25:59,590
defoliating you mentioned specifically

2107
01:25:57,579 --> 01:26:05,409
that we need to talk about caterpillar

2108
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:07,210
prevention so this is the time it

2109
01:26:05,409 --> 01:26:09,720
happens every year you know what do we

2110
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:12,670
do to get rid of caterpillars and

2111
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:14,560
they've already got full-blown or

2112
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:16,149
full-grown caterpillars inside your

2113
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,460
fully developed bud your [ __ ] there's

2114
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:20,559
nothing you can do aside from just

2115
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:24,399
manually picking through and pulling

2116
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:29,230
them out yourself that was now yeah it

2117
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:31,119
sucks yeah now is the time to apply

2118
01:26:29,229 --> 01:26:33,369
those preventative things that will keep

2119
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:39,489
them away and you're gonna have to spray

2120
01:26:33,369 --> 01:26:44,090
your bud sites spraying your sorry

2121
01:26:39,489 --> 01:26:46,409
I just heard voices in my head jump

2122
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:48,340
[Music]

2123
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:52,840
trying to fix it but you fixed yourself

2124
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:55,300
you're good you need some buds ight for

2125
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:57,640
that BT to beyond to to ward off the

2126
01:26:55,300 --> 01:27:00,970
parent from laying the egg in there in

2127
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:05,220
the first place so BT is what I

2128
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:05,220
recommend us like captain jacks

2129
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:13,730
Monterey Spray okay back back solicitor

2130
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:15,890
Schneider Bacillus thuringiensis I think

2131
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:20,419
Google keep talking on Google that way

2132
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:23,570
that's what I recommend for for getting

2133
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:27,140
rid of any kind of bud warm and now's

2134
01:27:23,569 --> 01:27:29,779
the time to apply it so also the garlic

2135
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:33,100
oil ferment that you were talking about

2136
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:35,539
yeah it's very good for that too even

2137
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:38,420
just a sensual garlic oil from the

2138
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:40,189
health food store would probably have

2139
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:44,630
some of the same properties in it right

2140
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:47,689
there yes it's bacillus thuringiensis i

2141
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:49,789
was really close yes that's that's

2142
01:27:47,689 --> 01:27:51,649
available from Captain Jack's it's

2143
01:27:49,789 --> 01:27:54,380
available in Monterey Spray is a very

2144
01:27:51,649 --> 01:27:57,139
very popular product used for keeping

2145
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:59,420
away it's also usable you can use it in

2146
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:02,560
the soil it will not cause any problems

2147
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:04,730
the mosquito dunks that you buy and

2148
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,020
whatever Lowe's or Home Depot it's

2149
01:28:04,729 --> 01:28:07,579
that's the main ingredient and there you

2150
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:09,080
can crush those up you can put that in

2151
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:10,369
some water you can water that directly

2152
01:28:09,079 --> 01:28:11,899
into your soil that will get rid of your

2153
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:16,519
fungus gnats that will get rid of most

2154
01:28:11,899 --> 01:28:18,529
soulbound creatures is another brand

2155
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:21,110
name that's a dry powdered product but

2156
01:28:18,529 --> 01:28:22,909
it's same active ingredient natural has

2157
01:28:21,109 --> 01:28:24,229
the same thing you guys if you're gonna

2158
01:28:22,909 --> 01:28:26,180
use any of these powdered products

2159
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:27,619
beyond the dunks the dunks are just fine

2160
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:29,390
probably to use without a mask if you're

2161
01:28:27,619 --> 01:28:31,789
gonna use natural or activate please

2162
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:34,310
wear a mask research everything before

2163
01:28:31,789 --> 01:28:35,720
use yeah when you get a new pesticide if

2164
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:37,400
you take that little booklet that's on

2165
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:38,900
there I know it's crazy nobody does this

2166
01:28:37,399 --> 01:28:45,559
that little booklet if you open it up it

2167
01:28:38,899 --> 01:28:47,479
tells you all the safety precautions how

2168
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,770
much to apply on certain types of crops

2169
01:28:47,479 --> 01:28:50,719
it tells you how long between

2170
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:52,480
applications it tells you what kind of

2171
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,820
safety equipment you need to wear

2172
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:57,109
[Music]

2173
01:28:54,819 --> 01:28:58,369
because if it's gonna rain and you apply

2174
01:28:57,109 --> 01:28:59,809
certain things it's just gonna wash

2175
01:28:58,369 --> 01:29:01,670
right off and you just wasted that whole

2176
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:04,580
application time and the expense on the

2177
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:07,010
product also in there it tells you the

2178
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:08,840
re-entry interval how long from spring

2179
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:10,850
this product should you avoid this room

2180
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,260
without wearing protective gear because

2181
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:13,910
some of the chemicals and products that

2182
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:15,079
are available to Hydra store much more

2183
01:29:13,909 --> 01:29:16,880
toxic and dangerous than you realize

2184
01:29:15,079 --> 01:29:18,859
they expect you to be a responsible

2185
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,779
adult that can read that label

2186
01:29:18,859 --> 01:29:22,609
that bear stuff the bear spray they sell

2187
01:29:20,779 --> 01:29:25,219
for your outdoor house it Lowe's that

2188
01:29:22,609 --> 01:29:26,750
can kill you that can completely kill a

2189
01:29:25,219 --> 01:29:28,039
human if you [ __ ] around and do it wrong

2190
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:30,050
so pay attention to the labels you guys

2191
01:29:28,039 --> 01:29:31,460
read that [ __ ] read the safety sheets

2192
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:33,260
and then it's really important I know it

2193
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:34,520
sound like a preaching to you but a lot

2194
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:35,960
of the things that you can get from

2195
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:37,909
these products you won't notice until

2196
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:39,618
ten or twelve years down the line you'll

2197
01:29:37,908 --> 01:29:41,388
start getting a facial tic or something

2198
01:29:39,618 --> 01:29:42,889
from that time there's a brief Laura

2199
01:29:41,389 --> 01:29:44,810
might into the fin and it came back into

2200
01:29:42,889 --> 01:29:47,300
your face that's how they affect you to

2201
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:48,980
its most they nervous system and

2202
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:51,079
reproductive system it's the exact same

2203
01:29:48,979 --> 01:29:52,428
thing they do to the insects exactly to

2204
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:54,109
kill yeah she's gonna take a little

2205
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:57,199
while longer on you because you're

2206

insects that is something I was gonna

2223
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:35,449
talk about on a future episode with you

2224
01:30:33,979 --> 01:30:37,069
but let's jump into it for a minute

2225
01:30:35,448 --> 01:30:39,829
beneficial insects is now the time to

2226
01:30:37,069 --> 01:30:42,529
release my a whole bunch of beneficial

2227
01:30:39,829 --> 01:30:45,350
insects yeah yeah I mean that'd be

2228
01:30:42,529 --> 01:30:48,469
totally cool predator mites and ladybugs

2229
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:52,100
for sure lace wigs I'd go for ladybug

2230
01:30:48,469 --> 01:30:54,920
larva especially outdoors okay the

2231
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:57,050
larvae are a lot more productive meaning

2232
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:59,779
they eat more [ __ ] okay they're still

2233
01:30:57,050 --> 01:31:03,020
growing yeah okay and there's no hanging

2234
01:30:59,779 --> 01:31:05,000
around longer - alright ladybugs - stick

2235
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:09,830
around is there a trick to that I've

2236
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,719
heard some pretty awful things for me

2237
01:31:09,829 --> 01:31:14,988
you know outdoors is where I use the

2238
01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:17,579
most and just having a nice welcoming

2239
01:31:14,988 --> 01:31:20,339
environment you know it's

2240
01:31:17,579 --> 01:31:22,380
there's not normally many pests on the

2241
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:24,539
plants but there can be pests found in

2242
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:26,819
the mulches and the garden beds around

2243
01:31:24,539 --> 01:31:29,069
so I think that works to keep them

2244
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:30,389
around stick around there too okay how

2245
01:31:29,069 --> 01:31:35,519
do you feel about a praying mantis

2246
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:37,860
they're awesome okay are bucco calm

2247
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,930

preventative to keep the bugs away if

2258
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:57,960
you want something a little stronger to

them out I use that product catalog all

2264
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:12,390
the time just for plenty of research to

2265
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:14,039
compare this versus this which is better

2266
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:15,660
you just hold the page aside and see

2267
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:16,979
what you like better and read them yeah

2268
01:32:15,659 --> 01:32:18,750
they've got everything in there but

2269
01:32:16,979 --> 01:32:19,469
again if you get some floor might if you

2270
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:21,210
get something crazy

2271
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:22,829
get yourself a Tyvek suit and some

2272
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:25,529

01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:26,640
suit up go all Walter White style and

2274
01:32:25,529 --> 01:32:28,800
that [ __ ] do it properly

2275
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:30,480
don't get Sam and I also think you're

2276
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,579
bastards for spraying that [ __ ] outside

2277
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:38,339
yeah don't ever spray it outside it

2278
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:41,449
don't kill bees it's just personal

2279
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:44,880
opinion without the food right

2280
01:32:41,449 --> 01:32:48,840
everything I eat grows everything I

2281
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:51,390
either grows something that grows your

2282
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:53,690
food eats my food yep it's not fair

2283
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:57,680
it'd be a pretty shitty place without

2284
01:32:53,689 --> 01:33:01,169
pollinators yeah absolutely so we want

2285
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:03,420
ladybugs we want beneficial predators

2286
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:05,850
predatory mites is what I'm thinking we

2287
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:07,079
want some of the preying mantises what

2288
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:08,500
other kind of bugs can we put out there

2289
01:33:07,079 --> 01:33:11,420

2346
01:35:19,319 --> 01:35:26,188
need one other quick thing plants are

2347
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:27,929
gonna start using more water so don't

2348
01:35:26,189 --> 01:35:29,668
just give them what they'll take and

2349
01:35:27,929 --> 01:35:31,828
what they need to stay perked up if you

2350
01:35:29,668 --> 01:35:34,050
want big fat bugs you gotta get them

2351
01:35:31,828 --> 01:35:36,149
lots of water lots of water I guess that

2352
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:40,199
that mainly applies to inground plants

2353
01:35:36,149 --> 01:35:43,018
but same same you know same for potted

2354
01:35:40,198 --> 01:35:45,238
container it I mean it'll take so much

2355
01:35:43,019 --> 01:35:46,860
water but right but as soon as it dries

2356
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:48,839
give it some more oh yeah don't be shy

2357
01:35:46,859 --> 01:35:50,698
don't sleep in and think you can water

2358
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,989
those plants later no you can't you

2359
01:35:50,698 --> 01:35:53,668
gotta get out there and water right now

2360
01:35:51,988 --> 01:35:54,988
if you're not want to stay on it don't

2361
01:35:53,668 --> 01:35:57,840
start it that's the truth

2362
01:35:54,988 --> 01:35:59,668
if you let them dry out it's a

2363
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:04,050
noticeable chunk out of your harvest

2364
01:35:59,668 --> 01:36:06,179
yeah it's I'm sure it's like that an

2365
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:07,619
indoor or outdoor yeah how do you feel

2366
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:09,538
about using a drip system in an outdoor

2367
01:36:07,618 --> 01:36:11,429
girl awesome awesome

2368
01:36:09,538 --> 01:36:12,658
okay it's I've promised the listeners

2369
01:36:11,429 --> 01:36:15,090
that I would talk about building a drip

2370
01:36:12,658 --> 01:36:16,348
system but it's not a lot of plant

2371
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:17,729
involvement and I don't want to spend

2372
01:36:16,349 --> 01:36:20,340
too much of an episode talking about

2373
01:36:17,729 --> 01:36:21,929
building PVC pipes that actually kind of

2374
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:25,439
be a hard episode cause it's not really

2375
01:36:21,929 --> 01:36:27,989
hard but some that just go do it just

2376
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:29,249
get your hands dirty yeah I'll just

2377
01:36:27,988 --> 01:36:30,958
there you go that's perfect I'll give

2378
01:36:29,248 --> 01:36:32,309
them like a 5 or 10-minute primer like

2379
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:33,779
here's what you need a pump and some

2380
01:36:32,309 --> 01:36:35,429
tubes and a [ __ ] octopus head and

2381
01:36:33,779 --> 01:36:39,149
some tubing and some sprinklers and you

2382
01:36:35,429 --> 01:36:41,309
build that it seems really tutorial yeah

2383
01:36:39,149 --> 01:36:42,238
just like Jesse said just doing it

2384
01:36:41,309 --> 01:36:44,309
because you got to get out there and

2385
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:46,348
measure you need a tape measure and a

2386
01:36:44,309 --> 01:36:47,849
PVC pipe cutter and just got to go to

2387
01:36:46,349 --> 01:36:50,400
town to learn how to build it's like

2388
01:36:47,849 --> 01:36:53,969
Legos basically I bought these two $30

2389

kits from Lowe's and like I'd never this

2390
01:36:53,969 --> 01:36:58,019
was last year never really done a drip

2391
01:36:56,010 --> 01:37:00,269

and talk about chaotically randomly that

2403
01:37:22,288 --> 01:37:24,719
you want to make sure that people hear

2404
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:26,809
on a podcast anything you got coming up

2405

18 actually there's a 311 you used to

2438
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:27,738
actually get in fistfights with sublime

2439
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:29,300
which is my favorite band and

2440
01:39:27,738 --> 01:39:33,888
a lot of people they sound like the

2441
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:35,989
exact same band but so I don't like 311

2442

2631
01:59:19,630 --> 01:59:24,670
more than 50% of my listeners are from a

2632
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:29,730
place where cannabis is illegal so they

2633
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:29,730
know very basic knowledge about cannabis

2634
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:36,369
[Music]

2635
01:59:32,969 --> 01:59:42,100
well terpenes are in basically every

2636
01:59:36,369 --> 01:59:44,109
type of well there's two different types

2637
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:46,539
of things that could be in fruits or

2638
01:59:44,109 --> 01:59:51,179
vegetables and stuff like that beans or

2639
01:59:46,539 --> 01:59:54,698
esters but a lot of stuff that you get

2640
01:59:51,179 --> 01:59:57,730
either smell from or taste from comes

2641
01:59:54,698 --> 02:00:02,859
from some type of terpene combination

2642
01:59:57,729 --> 02:00:06,279
and apples oranges bananas everything

2643
02:00:02,859 --> 02:00:08,738
they also are in cannabis now from my

2644
02:00:06,279 --> 02:00:11,319
understanding as of right now there

2645
02:00:08,738 --> 02:00:14,349
hasn't been any esters found in cannabis

2646
02:00:11,319 --> 02:00:17,429
but there are tons of terpenes and there

2647
02:00:14,350 --> 02:00:22,659
are over a hundred and fifteen terpenes

2648
02:00:17,429 --> 02:00:26,529
150 terpenes that make up kind of a

2649
02:00:22,658 --> 02:00:30,368
plant profile yeah right now the best

2650
02:00:26,529 --> 02:00:34,210
labs can maybe test for thirty of them

2651
02:00:30,368 --> 02:00:36,189
maybe 34 um maybe the best labs honest

2652
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:38,770
you don't even know ha anchor those 30

2653
02:00:36,189 --> 02:00:42,368
tests those 30 terpenes two testings

2654
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:44,080
actually how accurate they are but after

2655
02:00:42,368 --> 02:00:50,189
that there's some companies that can go

2656
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:53,738
for 15 or even 10 so I mean it's it's

2657
02:00:50,189 --> 02:00:55,448
that's basically there's a whole bunch

2658
02:00:53,738 --> 02:01:00,299
of different terpenes that make up a

2659
02:00:55,448 --> 02:01:03,819
plant profile so the Turks are basically

2660
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:05,590
it's smell it's taste but also there's a

2661
02:01:03,819 --> 02:01:08,829
lot more than just smelling taste to it

2662
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:12,190
and this guy sat next to knows a lot

2663
02:01:08,829 --> 02:01:14,948
about the health benefits and actually

2664
02:01:12,189 --> 02:01:16,868
knows a lot about terpenes and that's

2665
02:01:14,948 --> 02:01:20,979
why actually the big article in the

2666
02:01:16,868 --> 02:01:23,198
magazine is about and he knows a lot

2667
02:01:20,979 --> 02:01:27,309
about the health benefits there is a lot

2668
02:01:23,198 --> 02:01:31,559
of stuff to do with the taste of it

2669
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:54,189
most people that buy it only understand

2670
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:54,189
[Music]

2671
02:01:58,989 --> 02:02:05,729
[Music]

2672
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:08,310
so basically as popular as terpenes are

2673
02:02:05,729 --> 02:02:10,049
for flavor they do a lot more medically

2674
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:11,520
I actually had a chance to talk with max

2675
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:13,500
Montrose he's the head of the trichome

2676
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:15,690
Institute and he is you know he is

2677
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:17,970
probably the beats her peen head beats

2678
02:02:15,689 --> 02:02:19,799
her peen expert so he gave me you know

2679
02:02:17,970 --> 02:02:22,710
really nice little education and you

2680
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:24,390
know terpenes are basically the way he

2681
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:25,949
described it in the way that I kind of

2682
02:02:24,390 --> 02:02:27,750
explained it in the article is basically

2683
02:02:25,949 --> 02:02:29,550
like a glass of beer so when you have a

2684
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:30,960
fresh cannabis plant that's a fresh

2685
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:32,310
glass of beer with all of those bubbles

2686
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,230
floating off all that carbonation

2687
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:36,000
floating up to the top over time that

2688
02:02:34,229 --> 02:02:37,739
disappears over time with a fresh

2689
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,029
cannabis plant those fresh oils those

2690
02:02:37,739 --> 02:02:40,619
fresh terpenes on the end of the plan

2691
02:02:39,029 --> 02:02:43,199
are going to disappear over time okay

2692
02:02:40,619 --> 02:02:54,590
and those not only add flavor but they

2693
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:57,029
also add depending on what time of

2694
02:02:54,590 --> 02:03:01,250
harvest you do with the plant you can

2695
02:02:57,029 --> 02:03:01,250
also pull different terpenes they do

2696
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:12,670
earlier you can get a higher CBG or cbn

2697
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:18,528
rate usually

2698
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:18,529
[Music]

2699
02:03:24,628 --> 02:03:29,788
definitely would be affected to

2700
02:03:26,698 --> 02:03:31,108
increase/decrease and really what

2701
02:03:29,788 --> 02:03:32,788
fascinated me most I think about my

2702
02:03:31,109 --> 02:03:34,709
conversation with Max Montrose's really

2703
02:03:32,788 --> 02:03:36,628
that what people think is the medical

2704
02:03:34,708 --> 02:03:38,788
benefit coming from cannabinoids might

2705
02:03:36,628 --> 02:03:40,019
really be coming from terpenes so it's

2706
02:03:38,788 --> 02:03:41,698
really kind of you have to really

2707
02:03:40,019 --> 02:03:42,958
combine the two to really get a full

2708
02:03:41,698 --> 02:03:47,368
picture of really what's happening cuz

2709
02:03:42,958 --> 02:03:49,800
every strain has CBD CBN CPG depending

2710
02:03:47,368 --> 02:03:51,118
on the distrain to some ratio but what

2711
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:52,889
really differs of what really

2712
02:03:51,118 --> 02:03:54,328
differentiates excuse me a lot of

2713
02:03:52,889 --> 02:03:56,309
strains is that terpene profile because

2714
02:03:54,328 --> 02:03:58,618
not every strain is gonna have that

2715
02:03:56,309 --> 02:04:24,748
certain combination of the combination

2716
02:03:58,618 --> 02:04:27,688
of talking about I have talked to max

2717
02:04:24,748 --> 02:04:29,219
and I do know that there are still more

2718
02:04:27,689 --> 02:04:31,349
studies hopefully that there's gonna be

2719
02:04:29,219 --> 02:04:33,658
even bigger studies going on obviously

2720
02:04:31,349 --> 02:04:35,599
with the advancement of cannabis in this

2721
02:04:33,658 --> 02:04:39,319
community hopefully more studies but

2722
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:44,819
what Stan was saying with is really true

2723
02:04:39,319 --> 02:04:47,069
without terpenes might not transfer in

2724
02:04:44,819 --> 02:04:50,009
your brain or transfer in your body the

2725
02:04:47,069 --> 02:04:53,128
same way so that's what kind of might

2726
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:54,570
there's still studies I'm not don't

2727

there's people talking about

2729
02:04:57,289 --> 02:05:23,050
without the terpenes and it's kind of

2730
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:23,050

02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:45,319
believe you get a better medicated

2755
02:08:41,448 --> 02:08:49,578
feeling once you add any of the Terps

2756
02:08:45,319 --> 02:08:52,250
like I like in the morning I like that

02:08:59,090 --> 02:09:05,480
berry or that Blackberry crush

2761
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:05,719
definitely I mean that's what I was

2762
02:09:05,479 --> 02:09:08,629
saying

2763
02:09:05,719 --> 02:09:10,760
I know I personally feel that without

2764
02:09:08,630 --> 02:09:13,460
surfing's cannabinoids wouldn't transfer

2765
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:15,679
in your your body the right way the same

2766
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:17,689
way as I don't see the right way the

2767
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:19,550
same way as they do right now when with

2768
02:09:17,689 --> 02:09:34,038
terpenes I know one thing is I love

2769
02:09:19,550 --> 02:09:35,570
Terps like what specific terpenoids work

2770
02:09:34,038 --> 02:09:37,899
for specific conditions what they may

2771
02:09:35,569 --> 02:09:40,578
help with because we already know

2772
02:09:37,899 --> 02:09:43,518
strains will work well for seizures high

2773
02:09:40,578 --> 02:09:45,288
CBD works good for like epilepsy oh he's

2774
02:09:43,519 --> 02:09:47,239
got an article in his hand to refer to I

2775
02:09:45,288 --> 02:09:49,340
love it when people come with research

and characteristics the D limonene

2794

terpenoids let it get a little bit too

2795
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:39,510
close to the light and it will panic

2796
02:12:35,109 --> 02:12:39,509
will start treating as a panic response

so everybody what we're talking about in

2826
02:19:08,459 --> 02:19:11,909
Colorado if you're a medical marijuana

2827
02:19:09,718 --> 02:19:13,799
patient you were allowed to grow a

2828
02:19:11,909 --> 02:19:15,379
specific amount of plants plants based

2829
02:19:13,799 --> 02:19:18,679
on what your doctor feels is appropriate

2830
02:19:15,379 --> 02:19:20,670
based on your medical condition or

2831
02:19:18,679 --> 02:19:22,710
honestly based on how much money's in

2832
02:19:20,670 --> 02:19:24,929
your pocket it just costs more honestly

2833
02:19:22,709 --> 02:19:27,089
so you pay for an elevated plaque on is

2834
02:19:24,929 --> 02:19:28,888
what we call it that allows you to grow

2835
02:19:27,090 --> 02:19:31,530
more plants and also to possess more

2836
02:19:28,888 --> 02:19:37,489
cannabis when you go to a dispensary in

2837
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:40,679
Colorado Springs we are able to grow

2838
02:19:37,489 --> 02:19:43,079
those patients have the dispensary to

2839
02:19:40,679 --> 02:19:46,170
grow those plants for them we call it

2840
02:19:43,079 --> 02:19:48,409
signing over your plants you become a

2841
02:19:46,170 --> 02:20:01,889
member

2842
02:19:48,409 --> 02:20:04,560

2843
02:20:01,889 --> 02:20:25,020
wants to tell us I don't know the first

2844
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:27,449
thing about growing well I've always

2845
02:20:25,021 --> 02:20:33,900
I've always smoked I've smoked long

2846
02:20:27,450 --> 02:20:37,260
before it was illegal and this dabin

2847
02:20:33,899 --> 02:20:40,469
thing was pretty new um about what maybe

2848
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:42,210
two years ago and at the dispensary I

2849
02:20:40,469 --> 02:20:44,549
was going to they kept saying you need

2850
02:20:42,209 --> 02:20:47,219
to try this you need to try this I know

2851

02:20:56,139 --> 02:21:02,139
canna Canyon Aaron Ana Pete they were

2856

like come on try it you have a high

2857
02:21:02,139 --> 02:21:09,549
tolerance try it when I tried it but I

2858
02:21:07,959 --> 02:21:12,879
wasn't too big on it cuz I didn't know

2859
02:21:09,549 --> 02:21:20,648

02:21:22,478 --> 02:21:27,879
encouraged me to go in front of a camera

2863
02:21:26,109 --> 02:21:28,359
when I didn't know what the hell I was

changing what it looks like to take a

2870
02:22:34,629 --> 02:22:39,039
big changes what people's opinions look

2871
02:22:37,870 --> 02:22:40,750
like you know what a high tolerance

2872
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:43,890
looks like what actually functioning on

2873
02:22:40,750 --> 02:22:43,889

3193
02:56:33,170 --> 02:56:41,069
remember you need places to gather and

3194
02:56:37,010 --> 02:56:43,200
consume you have people that have leases

3195
02:56:41,069 --> 02:56:45,239
that they can't medicate in their own

3196
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:48,000
apartment where they're gonna go

3197
02:56:45,239 --> 02:56:50,940
you need places like this we have

3198
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:52,889
learned here in Colorado so listen to us

3199
02:56:50,940 --> 02:56:58,260
we're trying to help you

3200
02:56:52,889 --> 02:57:00,588
we're not being arrogant he's completely

3201
02:56:58,260 --> 02:57:01,939
right and Colorado

3202
02:57:00,588 --> 02:57:04,488
the bills here we did not include

3203
02:57:01,939 --> 02:57:06,619
consumption areas so there's a gray area

3204
02:57:04,488 --> 02:57:09,228
these places could be shut down at any

3205
02:57:06,619 --> 02:57:10,279
time this candy cane in where we sit

3206
02:57:09,228 --> 02:57:11,809
here at this table and gathered

3207
02:57:10,279 --> 02:57:19,369
peacefully and take some dabs and have a

3208
02:57:11,809 --> 02:57:21,948
podcast together no more and it could be

3209
02:57:19,369 --> 02:57:23,930
over so when you do get around to

3210
02:57:21,949 --> 02:57:26,180
writing the legalization bills in your

3211
02:57:23,930 --> 02:57:28,010
state make sure you include these types

3212
02:57:26,180 --> 02:57:29,479
of places make sure you put so many of

3213
02:57:28,010 --> 02:57:32,088
these places available in so much

3214
02:57:29,478 --> 02:57:36,858
locality and rules for them because if

3215
02:57:32,088 --> 02:57:41,568
