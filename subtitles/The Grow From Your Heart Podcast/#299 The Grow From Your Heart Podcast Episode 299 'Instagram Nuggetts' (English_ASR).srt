00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:10,538
heart podcast this episode is a

4
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,419
compilation of clips from my Instagram

5
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:16,030

genetics on Instagram I've been going on

9
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,140
Instagram live and hanging out with my

10
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:27,579
Instagram friends and talking about

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,710
cannabis and I thought it would be a

12
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:31,538
really good idea to turn on a microphone

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,090
and capture some of my rents and use

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,039
them for the podcast so here are some

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,800

16
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,450

21

genetics on Instagram

22
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,269
ladies and gentlemen with no further ado

23
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:56,320
let's get down with the Instagram live

24
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,580
feed podcast bonus episode alright so

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,409
the question was what are the benefits

26
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,989
and drawbacks of bigger oil rig versus a

27
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:04,088
smaller oil regen a small oil rig makes

28
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,640
sense to me I'm using a small hitman rig

29
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:08,829
right now it's really small most people

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,000
would say that's really small the reason

31
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:12,039
I like it small is because I'm not

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,420
trying to fill this chamber with smoke

33
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,790
and carve it like we used to do with the

34
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,920
bomb I want my smoke to go from the nail

35
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,540
down this tube into the water to cool it

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
and then I want that smoke in my lungs

37
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,550
in my head punching me as quick and hard

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,019
as possible I don't need a big chamber

39
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,090
filled with smoke because that's a point

40
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:29,649
of a bond with a bong you light it and

41
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,870
you suck and suck and suck until this

42
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,670
big ol glass area the whole area is

43
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,978
filled with smoke then you pull the carb

44
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,269
and then you get a bunch of smoke with

45
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:39,879
oil you don't really need that because

46
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:41,259
as soon as you hit the oil onto the nail

47
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,609
and put a carb cap on there you're

48
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,340
getting plenty of smoke you're gonna get

49
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:47,560
it all so that's not necessary and I

50
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,210
don't like a big rig because I'm not

51
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,579
trying to an aunt inhale

52
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,889
a gallon of oxygen or a liter of oxygen

53
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,149
before I even start getting my dad into

54
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,359
me I just want to breathe in the dab

55
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,770
with this little rig there's no

56
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,659
resistance and hesitation basically as

57
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:04,539
soon as my nail as soon as my dad

58
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,609
touches this nail the smoke is in my

59
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,259
lungs and it's just it goes through the

60
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,968
water just enough to get cooled and then

61
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:12,068
it goes into me and that's what I want I

62
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:12,909
don't need a whole bunch of extra glass

63
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:15,039
for the

64
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:16,359
resin to stick to and steel my dad I

65
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,639
don't need to suck in a whole bunch of

66
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,580
extra oxygen and I'm not trying to get a

67
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,869
big ole smoky fill and then pull it in

68
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,880
carpet it's all coming to me right at

69
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,280
once because I've got a little rig and

70
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm not smoking flowers I'm gonna smoke

71
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,000
all of it with flowers you're gonna

72
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,290
smoke and tell that chambers fool and

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,639
then you think that's as much smoke as I

74
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:34,900
can handle and then you carve it and

75
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,099
then you put the bowl back in and we

76
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,840
pass it to the next dude and he gets a

77
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,729
rip unless you're doing snaps but

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,319
basically there's no need to get that

79
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:43,179
big-ass chamber of smoke so I like a

80
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,489
small rig this right here is perfect to

81
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,200
me this is a hitman it's called the

82
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,520
hammerhead because of the Perkin side

83
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,449
there the perc goes straight now and it

84
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,310
splits out left and right

85
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:53,229
it bubbles out of the sides it's a

86
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,509
hammerhead perk it's a sidecar

87
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:57,759
it's really small its compact it fits in

88
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:00,509
a cup holder this is the size rig I

89
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,979
think is perfect so that's my rant on

90
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,959
benefits and drawbacks of bigger versus

91
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:06,250
smaller rigs smaller is better I'm not

92
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,659
trying to fill up a whole bunch of space

93
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,430
with smoke and I'm not trying to smoke a

94
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,829
whole bunch of air before I get my dad I

95
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,969
want to take a DAB right to the head so

96
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:20,590
there you go that's my rant on that

97
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:24,550
thanks for that good question how long

98
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,750
do you keep the glass part um it depends

99
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,640
on which glass part you're using

100
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,949
honestly it depends on what how thick it

101
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,479
is and what size it is I've got two

102
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,209
different nails right here this one I

103
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:38,229
have to heat for about a count of 45 or

104
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:41,650
50 this one here I only give this one

105
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:43,629
like a 35 to 45 count there's two

106
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,159
different styles then I let it cool

107
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:50,079
until until I feel like it's right I go

108
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,759
hotter than most people the best way to

109
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,100
do it is to practice heat it up let it

110
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,500
cool heat it up till it kind of glows

111
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:58,509
and then set a timer and count 45

112
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,099
seconds then hit it if you feel it was

113
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:01,149
too hot or too cold set your timer for

114
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:03,250
30 or a minute

115
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,409
try again and to see where you like it

116
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,599
there's no perfect temp for dabbing

117
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:08,919
people say there is a perfect tamper

118
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,479
this is the perfect tip I think it's

119
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,369
personal preference I like kind of a hot

120
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,899
dab because I like a big dab there's

121
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,430
something about the lung expansion part

122
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,230
that I feel in my lungs that I enjoyed

123
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,090
that that's part of what I'm looking for

124
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,950
a lot of people like to take really cold

125
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,000
dabs and when you do that you waste a

126
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:23,529
lot of it and then you got to get a

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,569
q-tip and clean it out and I think

128
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,589
that's kind of silly I'm not here to

129
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,629
clean [ __ ] up I'm not

130
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:30,369
here trying to smoke to waste it to

131
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:32,379
taste it I'm here to get high that's my

132
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,209
mission it's medical it's recreational

133
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:36,279
it helps me out mentally physically

134
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:38,789
spiritually I want to consume it I don't

135
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,789
want to waste it

136
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,720
about interesting topics you know your

137
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,969
stuff keep up hey Thank You Man is a

138
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,629
great compliment now defend why you like

139
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,900
it hot

140
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:51,310
because I do bro because I do um there's

141
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,719
something about that lung x-mansion

142
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,300
something about that feeling it takes

143
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,319
your breath away it makes you uh I don't

144
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,000
know it kind of makes your body go into

145
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,530
shock maybe a little bit I'm not sure

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,709
there's just something about that

147
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:06,848
feeling of it's a mixture of a stroke an

148
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:09,489
orgasm a heart attack a panic attack and

149
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:11,829
bliss and ecstasy for a couple of

150
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,030
seconds just oh [ __ ] and I appreciate

151
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:15,339
that sort of a thing it's adrenaline

152
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:17,079
there's adrenaline in that also because

153
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:18,848
you're not supposed to get that much

154
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,779
smoke at that heat in your body at that

155
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:21,759
one time

156
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,918
I don't think and so my body goes whoo

157
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,419
and there's something that comes with

158
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:25,990
the high also with that that I just

159
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:27,609
enjoy

160
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,478
that's my defense for it Nick good

161
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,840
question and just cuz I do bro cuz I do

162
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:36,310
glow squad you've been thinking about

163
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,049
switching rigs I would go with something

164
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,449
kind of small and you don't have to go

165
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,038
expensive either I mean if you're gonna

166
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:44,079
buy a rig make sure that when you draw

167
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:45,639
through it that it doesn't put water in

168
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,709
your mouth watch I'm gonna hit it semi

169
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:53,560
hard and hopefully I don't get water in

170
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:55,329
my face cuz that's the main thing you're

171
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,098
not gonna dad through it that hard so as

172
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:59,408
long as you can put water in it to get

173
00:05:57,098 --> 00:06:01,060
bubbles and not get water in your mouth

174
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:02,769
that's an important thing to think about

175
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,120
and then is it comfortable hold it up to

176
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,939
your face and think about dabbing it is

177
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,918
it gonna work that's what I would do

178
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,899
your drying process at a home grow I've

179
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:13,718
got a whole episode about drying and

180
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:16,448
curing but quick rant about drying and

181
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:17,889
caring here's how I would do it drying

182
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:20,319
and curing actually starts a few days

183
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,329
before harvest I would go in and pull

184
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,158
off all the big leaves all the fan

185
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:25,508
leaves anything with the PDL anything

186
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:26,860
that's hanging off anything you can snap

187
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,840
off with your finger anything with a

188
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,158
purple stem a lot of the larger leaves

189
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,318
have now got purple stems at the end of

190
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:33,610
flower snap all those off anything you

191
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,539
can cut off without scissors just go in

192
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,330
there with your fingers and pull it off

193
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:38,500
then what the plants finish on the do

194
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,359
you plan on harvesting go in there and

195
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,180
cut them down hang them upside down let

196
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,430
them hang until the sticks pop you want

197
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,408
the stems to snap when you bend them you

198
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,668
don't want them to explode with dryness

199
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,680
you don't want to be POW and then they

200
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:52,060
fall apart you wanted to just go crunch

201
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,528
when you bend them in half if they don't

202
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,639
make a crunchy noise they're not dry

203
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:55,899
enough some are gonna be real

204
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,699
well they'll be real wet when you start

205
00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:00,098
they'll be rubbery they're gonna be real

206
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:03,250
juicy let him go until they pop crunch

207
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:04,930
now when they pop then you can cut the

208
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,110
buds off of the sticks and you can put

209
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,400
them into I like a rubber as an airtight

210
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,479
container I use a lot of different

211
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,378
things I was gonna grab something but

212
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:12,758
it's over there out of reach

213
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:15,789
put the buds into an airtight container

214
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,650
now now you can start trimming them at

215
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:19,180
will whenever you need to trim some buds

216
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:20,888
dump them out on the table trim them up

217
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,569
put them into the next jar that next jar

218
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,129
is where your trim buds go now you're

219
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:27,189
drying and curing them in that jar at

220
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:30,069
the same time so when the sticks pop get

221
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:32,528
them into the jar then make sure you

222
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:34,210
open that jar frequently because you do

223
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:35,740
not want them to start getting funky in

224
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,348
there once you get them into the jar

225
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,939
open it up depending on how moist they

226
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:41,620
are when they go in there honestly it's

227
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:43,330
gonna kind of depend I would open them

228
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,649
up about two hours after you put them in

229
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,449
there and feel them feel around is it

230
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,698
wet inside does it feel funky if it does

231
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,919
leave that jar open for a long time if

232
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,050
it doesn't close it back up check it

233
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:54,728
again in four hours feel it if they're

234
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,319
too wet dump them out and just let them

235
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:57,788
sit just let them sit out like on a

236
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,439
table or something just for a few hours

237
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:01,120
until they don't feel real squishy then

238
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,519
put them back in the jar and then you

239
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,310
want them to dry slowly you want them to

240
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:09,310
dry fairly slowly slower the slower the

241
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,959
better so that's put them hang them up

242
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,699
for four or five days that's basically

243
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,500
your dry process once the sticks start

244
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:17,288
popping now you're safe to put them into

245
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,399
a container an airtight container cut

246
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,990
them off the stakes get them into an

247
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,519
airtight container they haven't been

248
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,509
trimmed yet if you want to trim them

249
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,799
before you put them into the container

250
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,629
you can but they don't need to be

251
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,968
trimmed yet this is how I do it because

252
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:29,500
I've got large batches um they'll go

253
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:31,829
into a container and then you have to

254
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,320
burp that container frequently the

255
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:36,639
burping interval will extend over time

256
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,229
so your first day you're gonna want to

257
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,218
burp in like every two or four hours

258
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,839
you're gonna want to be kind of

259
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,159
obsessive in there and get in there and

260
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,310
make sure they're not getting funky if

261
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,139
you start getting a a warm hey funk sort

262
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:48,759
of a smell you [ __ ] up if it starts

263
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:50,769
smelling like ammonia you [ __ ] up you

264
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,929
waited too long to open it so every two

265
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,159
to four hours open it up stir those buds

266
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:55,328
around check them out make sure they're

267
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,429
not getting funky make sure nothing's

268
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:59,259
pressed together too much make sure

269
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:01,509
nothing is too juicy make sure it's not

270
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:03,189
sweating in there open it up leave it

271
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:04,629
open for fifteen to forty-five minutes

272
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,980
based on how much moisture is in there

273
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,149
again you're gonna have to learn this

274
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,350
it's an art that you're gonna have to

275
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,210
adjust to and your environment

276
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,950
I don't know how much humidity is where

277
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,840
is in your area I don't know the vapor

278
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,490
pressure deficit in your area I don't

279
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,620
know the temperature in your area I

280
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,659
don't know how much water content is in

281
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,950
your starting product so all of this is

282
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,469
gonna have to be adjusted this is a

283
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,870
guideline so get it in the jars burp

284
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,149
those jars frequently now when you have

285
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,250
time dump it out and trim what you can

286
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,870
separate the little trim leaf keep that

287
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,120
aside for concentrates put the buds in

288
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,980
another jar keep them you're not gonna

289
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,509
have to burp those dried and cured buds

290
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,580
as frequently you can seal them up put

291
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:41,740
them on the shelf or put them in on

292
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,920
stars however you want to do it quarter

293
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,690
pound bags [ __ ] pound baggies however

294
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,399
you want to do it stack them up and just

295
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,070
check them out every so often make sure

296
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,299
they don't get too dry or too wet again

297
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,490
wan Zillah just asked what are your

298
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:57,609
thoughts on Boveda or the boost to way

299
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,159
humid a pax I don't like them because

300
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,350
they kind of put a weird wet taste in my

301
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,990
product is what I think they were using

302
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,250
them at the dispensary before I was part

303
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,289
of management that was part of the

304
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,669
process they would dry and cure the buds

305
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:12,370
at the grow then they would throw a few

306
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:13,689
Boveda packs in the packages and seal it

307
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,370
up and then drive it to the dispensary

308
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,050
and they would take the product and put

309
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,870
it into a jar and then they would add a

310
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:21,159
Bovina pack to each jar and every time I

311
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,600
would buy the flowers I could tell

312
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,490
something was funky and then I noticed

313
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,840
that it was the beat the Boveda pack and

314
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,220
so we started taking those out and I

315
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,090
think it tastes like cannabis again I

316
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,570
think it imparts

317
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:34,149
a watery taste it just puts it puts like

318
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,550
a wet flavor into it I'm not a fan of it

319
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:37,990
if your buds are too dry maybe that

320
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:39,909
would help you moisten them up again and

321
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,799
Colorado he gets really dry here so I

322
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:43,449
understand why people use those we get

323
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,529
the Colorado crunch but if your herb is

324
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,629
dried and cured properly

325
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:49,120
you probably shouldn't need a Boveda

326
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:50,950
pack how do I feel about bud stored in a

327
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,080
freezer has it been dried and cured

328
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,400
properly if it was dried and cured

329
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,750
properly and then it's sealed in

330
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,829
something to where I'm sure that there's

331
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,299
no moisture you gonna get in there I

332
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,340
don't see a problem with storing it in

333
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:03,039
the freezer however I don't find it

334
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,509
necessary maybe the refrigerator that

335
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,949
would be better but if you want to

336
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:07,330
freeze it that's cool freezing it's a

337
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,650
good way to preserve [ __ ] I just don't

338
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,389
know what that's gonna do to your

339
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,659
cannabinoid content that's gonna change

340
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:16,029
something yes in a bag then glass then

341
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:17,019
freezer if that's what you want to do

342
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,309
man that works there's nothing wrong

343
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:19,600
with it but it may be doing something to

344
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,859
your cannabinoids it's going to convert

345
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,120
the THC in the CBD to other things and

346
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,339
not sure what's gonna happen I know that

347
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,549
he converts things so colds got to be

348
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:30,230
doing something to it

349
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:32,479
Terps are essentially VOCs which break

350
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,159
down with light water and air so

351
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,839
wouldn't burping be counterproductive if

352
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,759
you drive then just lock it in a jar for

353
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,550
a week or two preserves more trips than

354
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,278
burping yeah but also if you trap it in

355
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:45,588
that jar you gotta burp it to get the

356
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,679
moisture out moist the only way to

357
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:52,640
remove chlorophyll is to have moisture

358
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:55,039
ah the oxygen and the moisture and the

359
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,019
darkness create anaerobic acid within

360
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,789
the environment and that starts breaking

361
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,649
down the chlorophyll and XANA fill and

362
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:02,750
it makes it able to become a vapor which

363
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:05,089
when you open the lid that escapes and

364
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,629
without opening the lid that wouldn't be

365
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:10,279
possible and if you kept it closed for

366
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,689
too long it would get funky in there so

367
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:13,519
yeah we do want to preserve the turps

368
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,709
but we have to get the moisture out but

369
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,940
yeah keeping it in the jar would be

370
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,439
better for Terps but you got to get it

371
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,760
dried and cured first before you want to

372
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,800
do that you have to get the chlorophyll

373
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,939
in the XANA fill out and the only way to

374
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,429
do that is have a little bit of moisture

375
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,620
so that you can have the reaction the

376
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:29,059
chlorophyll comes out during curing yeah

377
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,159
that's the that's what you're trying to

378
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,958
do that's why it tastes better so it

379
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:34,639
drops a water molecule when that water

380
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,099
comes out it brings out the chlorophyll

381
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,259
the the moisture and the oxygen create

382
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,579
an acid in there that help break down

383
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:43,039
that chlorophyll when you open the jar

384
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:45,019
that pops out also when it loses that

385
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,879
water molecule the THC drops a water

386
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:48,320
molecule and becomes more psychoactive

387
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,320
that's what the drying and curing

388
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,800
process are all about is homemade open

389
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,028
and BHO decent if purged properly are

390
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,328
you talking about open blast like

391
00:12:56,028 --> 00:13:00,350
somebody just blasting it in their house

392
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:02,719
or their backyard hopefully they're not

393
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,490
blasting in the house right uh yeah back

394
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,129
in the day all we had was a homemade

395
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,440
open blasted BHO and all day that's all

396
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:11,448
we had that's what we started with and

397
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,130
people used to win cups and [ __ ] with so

398
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:14,750
yeah if it's purged properly it can be

399
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:16,490
great some of the better stuff is still

400
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,350
the small batch stuff in my opinion do

401
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,060
you have a good idea about your keeper

402
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,620
fee no while hunting before smoking it

403
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:24,139
yes as the grower and the breeder I can

404
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,959
see it by week five or six I already

405
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:30,500
know how long veg my plants before flip

406
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,208
mate that's a good question how long do

407
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,698
i veg my plants before I flip that is

408
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,750
all based on the size of your gross

409
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:37,159
space and how many plan

410
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,528
you've got and how long you've got to

411
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:42,198
grow if you've got a low ceiling you

412
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:45,230
gotta flip early if you have a whole

413
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:46,429
bunch of space go forever depends on the

414
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,688
size of the pot you're gonna use it

415
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:50,958
depends on the size of plant you want

416
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:53,480
when you finish I would say veg it until

417
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,419
it is about a third of the size you want

418
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,069
it done 1/3 to 1/2 it's gonna double or

419
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:00,740
triple in size based on genetics

420
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:02,479
wouldn't so if you start off if you veg

421
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,879
your plant till it's a foot tall by the

422
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,860
time it's done it is going to be 2 to 3

423
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,170
feet tall so keep that in mind it's

424
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,438
gonna double or triple in size depending

425
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:14,479
on the strain the genetics where it's

426
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:15,349
from and how much light you've got if

427
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,199
you don't have enough light it's gonna

428
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,730
stretch even more for the first three

429
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:21,139
weeks of flower that plant is gonna take

430
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,610
off and skyrocket and just start

431
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,139
stretching you're gonna have to learn

432
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:28,250
how to keep it down if it gets too tall

433
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:29,839
so ah veget and tell if you've got 6

434
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,339
foot ceilings I would say veget tell

435
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,750
it's about 2 feet tall and then you got

436
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,399
to flip it because it's gonna end up 6

437
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,889
feet tall by the time it's done so maybe

438
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,938
flip it at 18 inches just do the math

439
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,500
and make sure to save yourself some

440
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:42,500
ceiling height from the white because

441
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,549
you want to be at least 16 to 18 inches

442
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,470
from the light if you're using a really

443
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,909
hot light you may be able to get closer

444
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,139
if you've got some cooler lights but

445
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:50,688
you're gonna have to save yourself some

446
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:52,220
space so how long do I let my plants

447
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:53,480
avenge before I flip without knowing

448
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,250
about your gross space without knowing

449
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,409
about your plants your pot size your

450
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,019
environment or anything my best guess is

451
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:01,938
to say let them get half to two-thirds

452
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:03,019
or half to a third of the size you want

453
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:04,639
them when they're done is they're gonna

454
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:07,188
double or triple in size by the time

455
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,539
they finish I hope that helps what are

456
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:14,629
your favorite stem Terps you look for in

457
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:16,789
your male plants okay I get it now he's

458
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:19,159
talking about when I rub the stem on my

459
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:21,110
male plants what is the aroma and flavor

460
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:24,409
I'm looking for it kind of depends on

461
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,568
what I'm going after it sounds

462
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:28,039
disgusting but the puke Terp there are

463
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:30,289
male plants that smell like puke I've

464
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:32,179
had great success with male plants that

465
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:34,009
smell like puke every time if it smells

466
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:36,049
like vomit on the stem rub it's always a

467
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,399
good thing if it smells like vomit and

468
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,229
it makes trichomes and turns purple

469
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,419
that's always a good male plant in my

470
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,240
opinion if I'm looking to breed

471
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:45,769
something more on the sweet side I start

472
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,409
looking for those sweet Terps if I'm

473
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:50,028
looking for a fruit or a candy flavor I

474
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:51,980
start looking for that on the stem rub

475
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:54,230
then when it goes into flour

476
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,060
I'll go bust opens some of the male

477
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,860
flowers and smell them and rub my

478
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,088
fingers on them that male flower that

479
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,159
male plants gonna put off some good

480
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:02,600
aroma you don't have to go with just

481
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,549
stem rub you can go up on the flowers

482
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,350
also let your male plants go just cuz

483
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:08,120
they flower out and give you pollen

484
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,680
around twenty-five days and you can coat

485
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,480
the whole [ __ ] room doesn't mean you

486
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,859
have to cut it down then let it go six

487
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,899
weeks see what it does watch the

488
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,740
trichomes build-up watch that male plant

489
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:19,938
see what it's like then here's something

490
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,829
else you can do that I don't talk about

491
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:24,049
a lot this is kind of a trade secret

492
00:16:21,828 --> 00:16:26,179
this is something that uh I don't know

493
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,588
how many breeders do this but this is

494
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:30,438
something I thought of a while back why

495
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,060
not reverse a male plant if you've got a

496
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:33,588
male plant and you know you want to know

497
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,929
what kind of flavours and aromas it's

498
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:37,850
gonna put off reverse it just like we

499
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:42,498
reverse our female plants to make males

500
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:44,239
you can reverse a male to make a female

501
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:46,158
you can reverse your male plants to make

502
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:48,769
them females so then you can see what

503
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:51,139
they do as a girl so you can see what

504
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,908
your progeny from that male has

505
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,859
potential of doing you could be making

506
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:56,178
you can see what you're gonna do

507
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:58,009
does that make any sense I think so I

508
00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:59,899
think I worded that correctly you can

509
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,879
make your male plant turn into a girl

510
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:03,109
and then you'll have an idea of what it

511
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,429
would look like is a girl and you'll

512
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:06,338
have an idea of what you're gonna make

513
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,329
when you breed with that male plant

514
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:13,068
that's a good way to find out what

515
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:14,720
you've got alright the next question how

516
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:17,138
do you feel about the burners for spider

517
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,399
mites I'm afraid of flavor in my buds

518
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:21,528
burners for spider mites woody burning

519
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:22,818
are you talking about sulfur burners for

520
00:17:21,528 --> 00:17:24,138
spider mites I don't know that a sulfur

521
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:25,278
burner for spider mites is what you

522
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:26,688
would do and I don't know that that's

523
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,709
what you're talking about but tell me

524
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,240
more and I'll try to help you out

525
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,399
burners for spider mites I don't know

526
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,808
what you mean what up 702 thanks for

527
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:35,808
jumping in what do you think about

528
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:38,240
semi-industrial home rosin presses I am

529
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:40,158
NOT into rosin I think rosin tastes like

530
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,038
a burnt Pops or a burnt popcorn or a

531
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:46,879
popsicle stick it's not my thing

532
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:48,710
I'm not happy with rosin no thank you so

533
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:52,069
I have no good info for you on that

534
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,690
sorry my friend has a burner and he said

535
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:54,980
he would give me but I can just order

536
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,649
predatory dude I would order the

537
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,778
predatory mites uh if you were in flower

538
00:17:57,648 --> 00:18:02,058
and you have got bugs the predatory

539
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:04,128
mites are probably the way to go get the

540
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:06,019
the swore skis the California smait bee

541
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:07,638
get yourself some lace wings

542
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:09,798
I don't even [ __ ] around with the

543
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:11,990
praying mantis at this point just get in

544
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,388
there with smaller predator mites and

545
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:19,519
let them do the work there anything you

546
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:21,589
avoid in a male mm ah way to

547
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,720
stretchiness okay here's something to

548
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:25,609
think about when if I've got a 10 pack

549
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,038
of seeds and five of them are a boy five

550
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:30,439
of them are girls I would never use the

551
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:32,868
first two males that flower out and that

552
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,460
may sound weird but those two the first

553
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:36,439
two males to show me that they're boys

554
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,298
are gonna be too robust they're gonna

555
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,320
make hemp they're gonna be too dominant

556
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:44,418
in my cross all my crosses will come out

557
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,538
just like them so I try to find a male

558
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,190
that if I had five males probably that

559
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:50,509
third or fourth one that flips that

560
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,480
starts to show me that is use a strong

561
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:55,319
stud that's probably more likely to be

562
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,200
used than the first two the third

563
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,849
forth but if it Otto flowers I don't

564
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,019
want it if it can't handle nutrients I

565
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:02,699
don't want it if it doesn't give me any

566
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:03,809
trichomes or any colors I don't want it

567
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,200
if it doesn't have a good structure I

568
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:09,569
don't want it ah man it's more of what I

569
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,509
do want is easier to list than what I

570
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:14,339
avoid also what about stripping the

571
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:17,160
male's of a select few pollen branches

572
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:18,689
or just let it go naturally I bought

573
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,759
them up a little bit I don't Wally pop

574
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:24,390
as heavily as I do my female plants but

575
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,890
I do lollipop a little bit and then when

576
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,330
they start going I like to set him up on

577
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,920
another plant so that he gets up a

578
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:30,359
little bit higher so that he's up above

579
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,420
the canopy a little bit so that when he

580
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:36,729
does start dumping his stuff falls

581
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,410
but I don't strip him too heavily I like

582
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,690
a lot of branches cuz I need a lot of

583
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,808
pollen the way I [ __ ] around I use a lot

584
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:46,090
of pollen what flavors do you prefer bro

585
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:49,119
fruit tasting strains or fuel and Kimmy

586
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:51,339
type strains ah yes it just depends on

587
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,899
what I'm looking for in flowers with I'm

588
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:56,019
smoking so you're from the UK if I

589
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,750
recall correctly we call the buds the

590
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:00,430
pot we call that flowers here the

591
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,920
concentrates the hash we call that

592
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:05,440
concentrate so the flowers I prefer more

593
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,289
of the gassy cami fuel kind of flavor

594
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,269
the earthy stuff out of my flower but

595
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:12,659
when I'm smoking concentrates I like the

596
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:15,519
candy fruit ah

597
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,080
lemons skittle II kind of watermelon II

598
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,929
sort of stuff that's what I would prefer

599
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:22,839
so flowery earthy concentrates or

600
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:25,210
flowery earthy flowers earthy cushy

601
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,678
flowers fuelie flowers and candy

602
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,720
concentrates it's kind of my thing

603
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,250
don't get me wrong I'll take a phat dab

604
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,990
of some star dog or whatever you got if

605
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,660
it tastes earthy and feely but I would

606
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,039
just prefer the candy turps this dosey

607
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,750
doe that I was smoking it had like a

608
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,399
nice and vanilla creamsicle sort of a

609
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,289
thing to it was some chocolate behind it

610
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,059
and some earth in it that was really

611
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:44,889
nice the Skywalker's got stirred up this

612
