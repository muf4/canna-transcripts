what's up podcast world welcome to

27
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,640
episode 345 thanks again for joining me

28
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,409
you know I like to start these episodes

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,200
off by letting you know what I'm smoking

30
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:28,810
on I just took a ridiculous dab of some

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,629
infinity Oh G nectar from Green Dot labs

32
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,420
this is a combination of underdog og and

33
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:36,699
i-95 the label describes it as gas and

34
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,590
earth and I completely agree it's gas

35
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,799
and Earth and a little bit of a punch to

36
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,540
the face I'm always a fan of underdog og

37
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,819
that's also known as a lupus headband

38
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,190
and I've always been a fan of the i-95

39
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:51,758
both of those strains have got a gassy

40
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:53,319
fuelie funky kind of Kimmy kind of smell

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,450
and aroma and flavor to him and that's

42
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,669
right up my alley so the infinity og

43
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,969
nectar is a beautiful blend I definitely

44
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,710
approve you can tell it's got me rambly

45
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,259
but that's a good thing because this

46
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:08,859
episode is about one of my favorite

47
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:11,409
things a lot of my audience has shown

48
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,230

I'm famous for that [ __ ] also somebody

69
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,699
asked me what my favorite strain was and

70
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,439
I said I couldn't decide on my favorite

71
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:05,109
strain they were asking my favorite

72
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,819
strain I've bred I could not decide I

73
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,010
said I would give them my top three

74
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,469
favorite my top three favorite strains

75
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:15,548
that I have bred in no particular order

76
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:17,590
are the lemon Jeffrey arise and of the

77
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,180
grateful dog and I can tell you really

78
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,560
quickly why those are my top three

79
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,280
favorites the lemon Jeffrey is my

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,979
favorite because that lemon flavor that

81
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,169
limonene flavor that smooth lemon candy

82
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,399
the high - it is beautiful it makes my

83
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,320
eyes

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,719
it's fun to grow it's really easy to

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,370
grow it's really photogenic it makes

86
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,039
great concentrates and it really does

87
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,930
what I want and a plant overall so it's

88
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,069
got that lemon candy and I named it

89
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,870
after myself

90
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,609
lemon Jeffrey at the time that everybody

91
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,610
was naming strains after themselves

92
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,650
Arion had a strain scott had a strain I

93
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,210
wanted a strain and instead of just

94
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,730
doing a Jeff Shoji or something like

95
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,170
that I went with the lemon Jeffrey so

96
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,359
the lemon Jeffrey is one of my top three

97
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,219
favorites then on the same totem pole

98
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,010
there or on that same pyramid we have

99
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:06,039
got the arise arise is one of my

100
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,840
favorites because I did exactly what I

101
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,090
was trying to do with that cross I

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,300
thought what if I take a really indica

103
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,340
dominant wide leaf shorter stockier

104
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,579
plant and I cross it with this really

105
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,129
skinny leaf and the other male that I

106
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,469
used was like gassy and cushy and feet

107
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:25,420
smelling and the female that I used was

108
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,640
tropical and sweet so I was like what if

109
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,490
I cross those two it should make

110
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,139
something completely in the middle that

111
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,269
is totally unique and it did exactly

112
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,729
what I was trying to do so and and it

113
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:38,919
tested amazingly high it's not rare to

114
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,530
see a rise testing in the 27 to 30

115
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,720
percent area so a rise test super high

116
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,489
and it tastes really good and it's a

117
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,410
beautiful blend of that indica sativa

118
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,790
mix which is kind of what I was trying

119
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,060
to do there so it worked out beautifully

120
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,340
than the Grateful dog that was my first

121
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,339
feminized project and it went well and

122
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:59,169
the aromas and flavors that came from

123
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,849
that were just amazing the colors that

124
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,520
come from those plants were just amazing

125
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,840
and being my first feminized project

126
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,060
that I worked with and the first thing

127
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,469
that when we're at a party and nobody

128
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,269
had any herb but me and some buddies

129
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,710
like anybody got any weed and I was like

130
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,939
sure let's smoke some weed now like we

131
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:14,529
got to go in the backyard and I win the

132
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:16,029
backyard and I sat down on the steps to

133
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:17,739
it bust up my weed and put some in the

134
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:19,329
pipe and they're like holy [ __ ] as soon

135
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,340
as I cracked it open everybody at the

136
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:23,469
party was like damn that smells so good

137
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,419
and it was I felt the same way but I

138
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,860
didn't know it was that potent yet until

139
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,170
I had taken it out in the public and

140
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,030
everybody in there in that area was a

141
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,069
smoker we had all smoked plenty herb and

142
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,019
they all reacted heavily to the aroma

143
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,969
and flavor and the potency of that

144
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,740
grateful talk so I knew I had something

145
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,630
special there there's a whole nother

146

149
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:46,628
Bulldog episode we're gonna focus on

153
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:58,478
about that lemony goodness my namesake

154
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:00,698
lemon Geoffrey lemon Geoffrey is only

155

a beautiful plant it produces super

160
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,918
frosty buds that smell like lemon candy

161
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:19,748
and I always describe it as if you take

162
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,519
a box of lemon heads and pour the candy

163

candy smell that's coming from my lemons

166
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:30,308
skunk plant I've had this lemon skunk

167
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,519
for probably seven or eight years and

168
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:34,539
I've used her in a lot of crosses so she

169
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,598
smells amazing

170
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:39,728
but this lemon skunk plant grows kind of

171
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:42,428
tall kind of stretchy kind of extra

172
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:44,649
branchy and she doesn't put out enough

173
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:47,258
yield for how much space she takes and

174
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:49,119
she also flowers for too long but she

175
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,908
produces a lot of resin and she smells

176
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:54,639
amazing and I love the way it smells so

177
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:56,709
I chose to breed with her I chose to

178
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,329
breed it to my golden goat I have a

179
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,459
golden goat female let's talk about

180
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:03,009
golden go for a little bit golden goat

181
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:07,168
is island sweet skunk Hawaiian sativa

182
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:09,729
and Romulan it is a tropical smelling

183
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:11,978
sativa dominant plant that doesn't get

184
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:14,199
super tall it stays short and stout

185
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:15,758
because of the romulan in there if you

186
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,348
don't give it enough light it will

187
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,778
stretch and get tall on you but golden

188
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:22,088
goat will stay short and stocky if you

189
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:23,649
top it and give it plenty of light and

190
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:25,449
room to spread out if it doesn't have

191
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,309
room to spread it will go up but if you

192
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,838
have space for it to go out it will go

193
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:31,419
out and if you teach it to go out if you

194
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:33,908
train it it will spread so golden goat

195
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:35,438
likes to finish around eight weeks you

196
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:37,269
can let it go nine weeks if you really

197
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,189
want the lemon skunk on the other hand

198
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:41,288
that sucker could go ten weeks you could

199
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:43,269
let it go longer if you wanted and it

200
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:44,889
would really pack on the weight but the

201
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:46,929
romulan in the golden goat side of

202
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,259
things really keeps the flowering time

203
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:52,598
down so the golden goat has a tropical

204
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,999
delicious flavor it's shorter it's more

205
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,659
stout and it produces a lot of weight

206
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:58,879
some of my heaviest harvest

207
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,530
have come from golden goat I used to run

208
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,569
just lights of golden goat because I

209
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:05,659
could just pull huge harvest I could get

210
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,579
almost 3 pounds per light under the old

211
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,890
school single-ended bulbs back in the

212
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:12,199
day when everybody else was striving for

213
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,990
- I was pulling 2.6 and three pounds of

214
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,629
light with crops of golden goat in seven

215
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,100
gallon pots so those are the two parents

216
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:21,769
they're both females we'll talk about

217
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,560
that in a second my goal in this cross

218
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:26,599
was to take that lemon skunk smooth

219
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,149
sweet flavor and mix it with that

220
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,939
tropical flavor of the golden goat while

221
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:34,009
making more robust plants I wanted to

222
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:35,629
put some vigour and some beef into that

223
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:38,029
lemon skunk that lemon skunk is so

224
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:39,229
dainty and skinny and it just takes off

225
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:41,089
and grows straight up into the lights

226
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,610
but it doesn't produce a lot but the

227
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,769
aroma and the frost were so phenomenal

228
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,560
that I just had to work with it so I was

229
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:50,210
trying to make my own feminized golden

230
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,519
goat seeds because I had posted pictures

231
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,860
of my golden Goa crop and everybody went

232
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,169
nuts and wanted golden goat seeds so I

233
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,389
was making golden goat feminized seeds

234
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:01,309
now when I make feminized seeds

235
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:03,169
I always think why not put a couple

236
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:04,939
other plants in here do some thinking

237
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:07,129
about it and make some unique feminized

238
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,840
crosses while I'm at it I knew that this

239
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,879
lemon skunk and golden goat would pair

240
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,500
well I just knew it's something it's

241
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,179
like being a chef it's like being an

242
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,100
artist it's like being a musician being

243
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,019
a breeder sometimes you just know and

244
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,360
I've noticed that a lot of great

245
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:22,039
breeders are also chefs there's just

246
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,629
something with the palette you just know

247
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,029
that this and this are gonna make

248
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:28,039
something phenomenal and I hit the nail

249
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,049
right on the head with this one so now

250
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,569
let's talk about I said earlier both of

251
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:34,669
these are females the lemon skunk is a

252
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,040
girl it came from a seed the golden goat

253
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:39,259
is a clone only there's no male if the

254
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,569
golden go unless you get a back cross or

255
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:44,360
unless you reverse it which is what I

256
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,340
did I mixed my own solution of silver

257
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,200
thiosulfate and I applied it at very

258
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,470
specific rates and intervals and

259
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,379
dilutions and I turned my female golden

260
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:57,470
goat plant into a male that produced

261
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:59,840
pollen they only contained female

262
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,970
chromosomes so that when I pollinated my

263
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,060
female plant all of the seeds that came

264
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,950
out our only females and that cross is

265
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:09,949
the lemon Jeffrey that lemon skunk

266
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:13,400
female cross - the golden

267
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,110
go reversed male is the lemon Jeffrey

268
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,179
and that would be known as a lemon

269
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,220
Jeffrey r1 because it is technically a

270
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:23,419
reversal you see a lot of packages

271
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,070
that'll say whatever arise f1 or rise f2

272
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:30,259
or golden goat bx1

273
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:32,000
this is a lemon Jeffrey r1 alright

274
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:33,950
that's enough about the background and

275
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,220
parents of lemon Jeffrey let's talk more

276
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,140
about the plants themselves you won't

277
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,450
see a lot of morphology or different

278
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,819
phenotypes from the lemon Jeffrey it's

279
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,310
basically that perfect 50/50 mix of

280
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,990
lemon skunk and golden goat the plants

281
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:49,669
grow like those short stout Christmas

282
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,490
trees and if you cut the top off the

283
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:54,409
lower branches meet up at the top nice

284
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,480
and even and make a very beautiful nice

285
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:58,610
canopy you can leave that top glory bud

286
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,230
and it will produce a giant but up there

287
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,300
at the top but if you cut that main top

288
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,850
out and let all those bottoms catch up

289
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:06,949
you'll produce a big sea of beautiful

290
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,659
colors it'll produce nice long Spears

291
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,150
and it likes to be topped and it likes

292
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:12,500
to be trained and spread out so most of

293
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:14,419
the phenotypes are gonna have that

294
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,519
Christmas trees sort of shape to them

295
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:17,870
they're gonna be kind of branchy but

296
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,970
they're not gonna have a super dominant

297
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,039
top that apical top isn't gonna try to

298
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,440
stretch way above the rest of the plants

299
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,629
until late flower it's gonna turn into a

300
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,430
giant bud but through most of veg and

301
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:30,620
early flower it's not gonna take off

302
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:32,629
real tall late in flower that sucker is

303
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,700
gonna be a giant baseball bat up on the

304
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,710
top there but if you top that one you'll

305
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,900
get a whole bunch of arms just sticking

306
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,519
up and they'll be huge now there will be

307
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,500
a couple of weirdos in the mix you'll

308
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,389
see some weird leaves because that

309
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,789
golden go passes on some weird traits

310
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:48,649
but I've noticed in golden go across as

311
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:51,079
those super skinny leaves often have

312
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,610
more THC they've got more potency to

313
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,830
them the thinner the leaf the more

314
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,169
potent also the longer they take to

315
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,660
flower so you may see some weirdness

316
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:01,639
from the golden goat in some very rare

317
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:03,769
phenotypes you may also see phenotypes

318
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,169
that produce extra nodes and extra

319
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:07,220
branching I really like those phenotypes

320
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:08,719
those are great for commercial

321
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,940
production because I feel like more

322
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,680
nodes and more branching is room for a

323
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,630
more production you'll see what I'm

324
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,789
talking about when that pops up that is

325
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:18,830
a good sign if you see that I describe

326
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:20,809
it as most plants put off nodes at the

327
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,240
north south east and west positions

328
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:25,189
sometimes golden go across

329
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,500
we'll throw out a 5th and 6th set of

330
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,450
branches so instead of just a cross up

331
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,970
the stem of the meristem you've got more

332
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,950
of a spiral happening like a spiral

333
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,620
staircase of branches and it gives you

334
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,870
the opportunity for more production so

335
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,179
those are the basic Fino typical traits

336
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:44,480
of the lemon Geoffrey it's mainly a

337
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:46,849
50/50 mix of the lemon skunk mom and the

338
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,980
golden goat dad being a feminized cross

339
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,709
there's not a lot of room for a whole

340
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,528
bunch of variation in there however I

341
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:58,219
did mention there will be some mutants

342
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:59,570
from the golden goat background now

343
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,129
let's talk about the height of lemon

344
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,959
Geoffrey lemon Geoffrey will be fairly

345
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:05,570
tall at the end of flower but you will

346
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,929
have giant buds if you're not using any

347
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:11,360
trellising or sticks or netting of some

348
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:13,939
sort it's got the opportunity and the

349
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,889
potential to double in size through the

350
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,290
flowering cycle so be prepared for tall

351
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:20,778
plants maybe flower early if you're not

352
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:22,939
going to use a trellis or a straw or tie

353
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:24,950
these plants down in some way also if

354
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,420
you're gonna have that giant glory but

355
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,950
in there you're gonna need to flower

356
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:30,229
early because they're gonna get tall

357
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,509
that middle bud is gonna get huge if you

358
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,850
don't cut that main top out so the

359
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:36,828
plants will get fairly tall with

360
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,509
moderate stretch and flower they will

361
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:41,239
stretch on you if you don't take that

362
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:42,799
main top out I recommend spreading the

363
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,049
branches out if you're just using

364
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,519
individual pots put a bunch of sticks in

365
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:48,469
there around the perimeter of the pot

366
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,939
put them outward and then just spread

367
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,470
those branches out so that the whole

368
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,510
plant gets a lot of light clean up the

369
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,629
bottom quite a bit and let those long

370
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,578
arms develop long giant spear buds so if

371
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:00,919
you don't have some sort of trellis or a

372
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:03,739
tomato cage use some sticks and spread

373
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:05,509
out the plants real wide lemon Geoffrey

374
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,519
can cover some distance and it likes a

375
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:11,269
lot of light the more light you give it

376
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,208
the happier it will be if you take care

377
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,399
of lemon Geoffrey you should get fairly

378
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:18,259
generous yields I can get huge harvests

379
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
off of it in 3 gallon pots I can get

380
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,250
huge harvests and 7 gallon pots I've ran

381
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,778
it in private grows I've ran in-home

382
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,679
grows I've ran it in commercial grows

383
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:27,649
I've bred with it

384
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,208
this plant puts out generous harvests

385
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:31,339
even if you're a beginner grower you

386
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,099
should be able to get great harvests off

387
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,660
of this plant

388
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,070
now being a sativa dominant hybrid I

389
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:39,669
would recommend letting this plant go

390
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:42,250
around 70 days it may be ready around 63

391
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:44,769
I would recommend closer to 70 days you

392
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,389
will have better results of course

393
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:47,620
that's up to your schedule it's up to

394
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,710
your nutrients it's up to your

395
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,759
environment it's up to your lights

396
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,009
everything will make a difference there

397
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,620
but 63 to 70 days is what I would

398
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:58,569
recommend be patient because right at

399
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,789
the end there they may pack on a little

400
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,800
extra weight the lemon Geoffrey may bulk

401
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:05,230
up for you get a little chunkier right

402
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,639
at the end of flower and also she looks

403
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,960
so pretty right at the end of flower

404
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,639
when you're flushing her out and she

405
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,840
starts getting all chunky and those the

406
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,519
ends of the leaves just start turning

407
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,990
yellow and they start to curl down cuz

408
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,639
that's what she does at the end the

409
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,259
leaves get long and they just curl down

410
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,210
toward the end and they get real pale

411
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:20,830
and those buds are giant and bright

412
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,250
green it just looks so pretty at the end

413
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:25,480
if you let it go ten weeks so 63 70 days

414
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,759
that's what I would recommend for a

415
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,009
flowering time let's talk a little bit

416
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,470
about feeding lemon Geoffrey I have fed

417
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:34,330
the crap out of this plant and she seems

418
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,580
to be able to take a feeding although

419
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,190
all of my feeds are very well balanced I

420
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:42,520
do go high in PPM's but I'm not over

421
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:45,160
doing any one particular nutrient but in

422
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,110
my experience lemon Geoffrey can take a

423
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,969
heavy feeding and I would start off

424
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,220
feeding or strong because like I said

425
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,629
she goes 70 days and she'll need some

426
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,490
nutrients for the end so make sure you

427
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:57,580
get her fired up in the beginning our

428
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:00,669
plants uptake about 90% of their

429
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,840
nitrogen during the vegetative phase so

430
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:04,449
make sure you're feeding your plants

431
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,480
plenty of nitrogen in the vegetative

432
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,820
phase before flower to give them plenty

433
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,820
of energy you want to get that plant

434
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,230
ready to go don't OD your plants don't

435
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,250
think well Rasta Jeff said to feed them

436
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,899
a lot so I need to go in there and

437
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,779
[ __ ] slam them but make sure they're

438
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:21,759
getting fed appropriately at least make

439
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,949
sure you're giving them enough n P and K

440
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,899
and maybe some cal-mag and then

441
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,220
definitely take care of the roots put

442
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,870
something in there for the roots some

443
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,149
sort of root inoculants some sort of

444
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,500
microbial some sort of root booster you

445
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:34,509
want something that works on the roots

446
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,909
for your plants that's what I recommend

447
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:38,259
as a bare minimum but make sure your

448
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:40,089
plants are healthy before they go into

449
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:42,759
the fly into the flower phase especially

450
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,440
with a longer flowering plant like the

451
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,750
lemon Jeffrey it's gonna take 70 days

452
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,220
you want it to have plenty of nitrogen

453
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,049
you don't want to be chasing it you'll

454
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,120
see around week three for maybe week

455
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:53,379
five it starts fading already and you're

456
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,370
feeding it right but you're like what

457
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,139
the [ __ ] it looks like I've got a

458
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,610
deficiency it's because it just went

459
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,259
nitrogen deficient on you because it

460
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,000
took off you weren't prepared you

461
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:03,220
weren't giving it enough nitrogen late

462
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,859
in Flour or late in veg and possibly

463
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,240
early in Flour so feed your plants at

464
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,789
linden Jeffrey can take a lot of feeding

465
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,430
is my point to that rat also make sure

466
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:14,318
your pH is on point lemon Jeffrey and my

467
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,959
experience likes to be somewhere between

468
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,299
six point two and six point four in

469
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,980
cocoa or soil so when you mix up your

470
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:23,169
nutrients get everything all mixed up

471
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,838
the way you need it then get your pH pin

472
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,759
see what the pH is use your pH up or pH

473
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,289
down put a few drops in there until you

474
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,879
get it somewhere between six point two

475
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:33,099
and six point four that's where those

476
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,510
plants are going to want that solutions

477
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:36,159
where they're gonna react the best for

478
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:37,750
you they're gonna go crazy when you get

479
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,769
it dialed in pay attention to them and

480
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,329
write it down

481
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:41,829
write down the pH and then pay attention

482
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:43,720
to how they grew and then the next time

483
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:45,399
maybe if you went six to this time write

484
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,110
it down and see how the plants reacted

485
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,269
the next time adjust your solution to

486
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,709
six four and water the plants and write

487
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:53,019
down six four and see how the plants

488
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,680
react if they go if they if you can see

489
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:55,450
a difference

490
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,920
stick with what worked better right

491
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,420
obviously it's trial and error when

492
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,130
you're learning with cannabis anyway

493
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,789
make sure you get the pH correct make

494
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:06,040
sure you get the feed dialed in then for

495
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:08,769
sure got a sound like Brendan Schaub for

496
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,899
sure make sure you flush the [ __ ] out of

497
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:13,569
your lemon Jeffrey plants this strain is

498
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:16,240
known for its delicious lemon candy

499
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:17,740
flavor let's not ruin that by failing to

500
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,930
flush our plants at the end and making

501
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,120
it taste like burnt ash or something

502
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,830
funky like how much molasses did you put

503
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:25,809
in here at the end some [ __ ] like that

504
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:27,369
how much worm castings was in this mix I

505
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,869
don't want anybody to say that how much

506
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:30,250
cal-mag did you feed these plants you

507
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:32,500
don't want that make sure you flush it

508
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,289
you want it to taste like sweet lemon

509
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,599
candies not like botanic hair at the end

510
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,970
of the harvest so that sounds like a

511
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,730
good way to segue into the flavors and

512
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,559
aromas of lemon Jeffrey I know I say it

513
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,509
a lot but I think it smells and tastes

514
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,309
like if you took a box of lemon heads

515
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:49,869
and you poured those lemon heads on the

516
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,819
table and you just smell the inside of

517
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:54,429
the box if you squeeze it that soft

518
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:56,439
lemon head lemon sorbet kind of candy

519
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,840
smell that comes out it's also sort of

520
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,160
like country time lemonade powder if you

521
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,959
take the cut

522
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,070
time lemonade powder and you pop it open

523
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,420
and just stick your head in there and

524
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:05,799
give it a light smell don't inhale too

525
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,630
hard you don't want to snort up any of

526
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:09,129
that [ __ ] that's gonna burn ponies smell

527
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,450
that country time lemonade powder that's

528
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,150
kind of what the lemon Geoffrey smells

529
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,890
like or also maybe a lemon car air

530
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,170
freshener or also some of that

531
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,300
lemon-lime Gatorade powder and maybe

532
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,370
it's got a hint of sweet tarts in there

533
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:24,039
it's got that aftertaste that after

534
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:26,559
aroma of sweet tarts that's usually the

535
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,690
flavors that I experience with lemon

536
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,470
Geoffrey now let's talk a little bit

537
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:34,539
about the effects of lemon Geoffrey I

538
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:37,180
really prefer like a sativa heavy high

539
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:40,869
THC lemon-lime flavored kind of a strain

540
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:43,240
for my daytime smoke some people may

541
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:46,509
find lemon Geoffrey to be too potent

542
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:51,849
attests in the high 20s consistently 24

543
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:54,339
to 28 I've seen 28% THC a sometimes

544
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:57,609
that's too much for people I think it's

545
00:19:54,339 --> 00:20:00,789
great it makes me feel euphoric and

546
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:03,579
talkative and energized some people it

547
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:05,230
makes them a little anxious I've noticed

548
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,939
that the people that are already going

549
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,529
kind of fast the people that are real

550
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,509
talkative and that have a lot of

551
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:12,549
thoughts and have a lot to say and are

552
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,410
always speaking a lot I feel like the

553
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,599
strains with limonene things like lemon

554
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,910
Geoffrey and lemon skunk I feel like

555
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:21,459
those strains sort of even those people

556
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,810
out it balances their conversation it

557
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,460
slows them down and it puts them more on

558
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:26,440
a focus thing instead of just being in a

559
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,090
spin it kind of gives them a target and

560
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,799
they can kind of quit talking at

561
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:32,740
everybody and kind of look at a person

562
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:34,779
and talk to a person I think that the

563
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,599
lemon Geoffrey and the lemon skunk kind

564
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:39,819
of do that but that's just for the that

565
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,309
fast minded talkative kind of a person

566
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:43,990
with that creative just non-stop kind of

567
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,309
a mind people that don't consume a lot

568
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,620
of cannabis and people that are already

569
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:49,839
kind of quiet people that can get

570
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:51,429
jittery and anxious sometimes the lemon

571
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,629
Geoffrey may kind of give you a little

572
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,580
bit of the sweats and a little bit of

573
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,460
the nerves because it is a quite potent

574
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:59,199
strain for me it's a beautiful morning

575
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,329
smoke I love that lemon flavor in the

576
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,920
morning it wakes my brain up it puts all

577
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:04,869
the pieces of my puzzle I feel like

578
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,220
overnight my brain just fell apart the

579
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:07,869
puzzle pieces went everywhere I feel

580
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,789
like the lemon Geoffrey just puts the

581
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:11,919
puzzle pieces right back together for me

582
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:14,099
so for me lemon Geoffrey puts me right

583
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,710
in that sweet spot for other

584
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:18,778
it could be too much I could make you

585
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,519
super giggly it could make you super

586
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:23,009
paranoid it will definitely make you

587
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,960
talkative and energetic so let's talk

588
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:27,119
about some of the medical effects of

589
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,579
lemon Jeffrey I am NOT a doctor I am

590
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,889
reading these effects off of Leafly so

591
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:34,918
the effects that have been reported to

592
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:37,799
Leafly about lemon jeffrey are it's good

593
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,799
to relieve stress which i believe

594
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:43,710
because limonene the terpene found in

595
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,509
lemon Jeffrey has definitely been linked

596
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,610
to stress relief they are actually doing

597
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:50,158
scientific research on terpenoids and

598
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:52,288
limonene has been proven to help with

599
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,539
stress relief so that definitely is

600
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:56,129
believable the next thing on the list is

601
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:57,929
depression of course if you're not as

602
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,610
stressed you're not as depressed and if

603
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:01,980
you're giggling and smiling you don't

604
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:04,199
feel depression so I believe that lemon

605
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,419
Jeffrey could help ease the effects of

606
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,700
your depression also it says here

607
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,799
headaches I know for sure that golden

608
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,929
goat crosses will help with migraines

609
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,329
I've seen it work on multiple people so

610
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:17,220
it says here that lemon Jeffrey will

611
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:20,308
help with your headaches I completely

612
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:23,880
believe that also lemon Jeffrey has been

613
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:25,888
known to help prevent seizures in folks

614
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,080
with epilepsy so that is a great medical

615
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:29,398
quality of the lemon Jeffrey again I am

616
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,199
NOT a doctor these are just things that

617
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:33,750
have been reported by consumers and

618
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,308
patients to Leafly I am just sharing

619
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,869
that information with you your

620
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:39,210
experience may be different that's my

621
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:40,619
little disclaimer here so those are some

622
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,880
of the effects reported from lemon

623

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,660
a great strain for extraction I'm

655
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,058
looking at a lab test on my phone and

656
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,259
I've got a concentrate test from a

657
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:50,548
friend who I'm not sure if they want

658
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,808
their name mentioned on the show they

659
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:53,849
know who they are shout out for the

660
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:56,609
great word bro I've got a lab test that

661
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:59,459
is showing eighty six point six total

662
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:03,509
cannabinoids with seventy five point

663
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,730
four percent THC the terpene test is

664
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:07,589
showing three point four six percent

665
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,380
terpenes and that is from a lemon

666
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:12,629
Jeffrey concentrate sample so the lemon

667
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,580
Jeffrey makes wonderful concentrates it

668
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,320
always tastes super good it always gives

669
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,449
me an amazing high the lemon Jeffrey

670
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,649
concentrates make my eyes jitter they

671
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,029
make my eyes jump up and down like

672
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,350
remember when you were a kid and used to

673
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,849
ride the school bus and he'd lean your

674
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:25,019
head on the window and your eyes would

675
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:26,279
jump up and down a little bit and

676
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:27,750
everything would move around real weird

677
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,250
that's kind of what it feels like when

678
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,259
you first take your dab of lemon Jeffrey

679
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,519
everything goes you got to grab the

680
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,890
table and get your [ __ ] together it's

681
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,230
real nice I really enjoy it so it makes

682
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:40,520
great concentrates one great thing about

683
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:42,659
lemon Jeffrey is it takes heat very well

684
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,429
lemon Jeffrey is known to get kind of

685
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,470
tall so it's gonna grow right toward

686
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:48,480
those lights it will take that light

687
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,950
heat fairly well I'm not saying put it

688
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,870
up against the light but if it gets too

689
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,759
close and it gets kind of warm it's not

690
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:54,029
gonna get too crazy and get too mad on

691
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,940
it

692
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:58,379
I feel like limonene is a heat reaction

693
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,029
and a heat response it's a stress

694
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,799
response in the plants and I think if we

695
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:03,538
stress it with light and heat a little

696
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:05,250
bit it will create a little more

697
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,079
limonene in the plants have you noticed

698
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,400
if you put your plants too close to the

699
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,949
light sometimes they'll tastes lemony

700
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,630
even if they're not a lemon strain well

701
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,269
if you do it with a lemony strain it

702
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,130
will even more lemon it so they take the

703
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:18,808
heat very fairly well they are kind of a

704
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,000
sativa dominant so they're not super

705
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:22,470
tight they don't have gigantic leaves so

706
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,509
you're not running a lot of problems and

707
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,788
that higher heat they can take it all so

708
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:28,798
I've never seen powdery mildew on a

709
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:30,298
lemon Jeffrey plant before so those are

710
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,859
a few tips those are a few pointers with

711
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:33,629
the lemon Jeffrey run it for

712
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:36,298
concentrates run it for flowers make

713
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,429

715
