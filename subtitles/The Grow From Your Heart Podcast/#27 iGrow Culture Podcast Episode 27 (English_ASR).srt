128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,600
your know if totally not yeah yeah I

129
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,020
just I feel that because I'm a red card

130
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,970
patient and the place that has my my

131
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,189
card or the place that I like to go to

132
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,100
anyways my preferred place is now

133
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:49,379
recreational and it's a it's a line

134
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,480
there's a line to get in to get your mad

135
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,839
it's the same place you know they can

136
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,970
only make the st. 12 people back at one

137
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,549
time and it's the same building same how

138
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,419
long does that line take you now I

139
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,949
haven't been out there since they've

140
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:03,959
really done in the sides one or two

141
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,189
times and one time I've walked right in

142
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,859
there because there was nobody in there

143
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:09,180
but the other times it's been five or

144
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,340
six people ahead of me and pee

145
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,139
walk in behind me and they're like oh no

146
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,969
and they just turn around and walk out

147
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,800
yeah that's a long time the way we just

148
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,270
had a shop downtown they're not heard

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,770
Android the business people would wait

150
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:21,689
in line for an hour because the whole

151
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,948
front of the place would be full all

152
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:25,879
right I'm gonna get in this article a

153
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:28,560
little bit right it says Ryan REE Ryan

154
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:31,288
Griego on the recreational pot shop and

155
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,569
cover southern Colorado and he's putting

156
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:35,939
out a bold and formed estimate saying

157
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:37,800
that decidedly decidedly clear majority

158
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,089
of his customers are from outside of

159
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,110
Colorado I'm gonna take a big breath

160
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:43,258
here because I can't even read after

161
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,910
that dab I think the dispensary this guy

162
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,740
is from is actually they posted a really

163
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,990
cool shot of the canna sewer and this

164
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,910
article online here a really cool angle

165
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,019
of the sign and the building style shook

166
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,259
in place with a great Colorado

167
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:57,478
background is that a dope shot a dope

168
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,120
shot right haha I didn't even mean that

169
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,800
fun alright I'm back in my game let's go

170
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,389
eighty percent of my customers are

171
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,699
coming from other states predominantly

172
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:08,280
Texas New Mexico Kansas and arrogant

173
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,990
Arizona said Griego owner of Kanna sewer

174
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,269
and pueblo west which opened its doors

175
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,098
in may for recreational marijuana sales

176
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:15,930
I knew there would be out of state

177
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:17,728
customers coming in but I thought would

178
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,050
thought it would be more of a 30 70

179
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,939
split with thirty percent of my

180
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,340
customers from out of state but it's

181
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,469
more severe than that on the flip-flop I

182
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,689
don't think severe was the right word

183
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,280
out of state tourists account for forty

184
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,469
four percent of all retail sales and

185
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,509
then in the Denver area at about ninety

186
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,580
percent in Mountain Resort such as Aspen

187
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:37,199
or Telluride according to a recent study

188
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,240
produced by the Colorado marijuana

189
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,829
Enforcement Division as we've talked

190
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,918
about the marijuana Enforcement Division

191
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:45,930
or the Med they're the guys the division

192
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:49,079
in charge of regulating the dispensaries

193
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,269
and the grows and all of that stuff they

194
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,069
are in charge of the marijuana and they

195
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:55,680
regulate all of that stuff they make the

196
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,769
rules and they are also are also a

197
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,538
branch of the IRS so that's pretty legit

198
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,250
they're a huge place they'd make a lot

199
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:05,610
of rules they [Â __Â ] and put their foot

200
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,740
down and it matters tweet me every time

201
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,330
I say the f-word every time I say [Â __Â ]

202
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,500
just tweet me and tell me to stop doing

203
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:12,750
it please but I'm trying to stop doing

204
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,399
that on the show trying to cut that word

205
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,360
out of my vocabulary it's not even a

206
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,769
cool word to use for anything but anyway

207
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,900
but for a shop in Pueblo hardly

208
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,740
considered in the same tourism league as

209
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,299
Aspen or tell

210
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,860
right to make eighty percent of its

211
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,530
sales to out-of-state visitors is

212
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,780
something an oven anomaly even given

213
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,778
plug Louis proximity less than 100 miles

214
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,069
to the new mexico state line they're not

215
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:37,469
joking at all about the differences

216
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,278
between aspen telluride compared to

217
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,300
Pueblo Pueblo is it's a cool place if

218
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,330
you live here and you know where you're

219
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,829
going but is a steel town it's a steel

220
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,810
mill town it's a blue-collar working

221
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,399
man's town and Aspen until your rider

222
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:52,919
places where you go to spend some time

223
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,809
we don't have we have a reservoir here

224
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,338
we've got a river walk here we've got

225
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,979
some really cool trails and things

226
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,839
there's a castle about the rent it out

227
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,550
here I mean Pablo is definitely nice to

228
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,899
come and see but there's nothing here to

229
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:08,789
like oh he also has yeah this it has

230
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,190
everything that a normal town has and

231
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:12,719
it's pretty yeah so to say that eighty

232
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,790
percent of our sales are going to

233
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,500
out-of-state visitors is kind of

234
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:19,349
shocking well we have a lot of

235
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,789
recreational weed shops here in the shop

236
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,509
that you're talking about is one hundred

237
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:26,069
percent recreational so do you think

238
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:28,049
that the numbers are the same across the

239
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,970
board at the shops at the rec shops that

240
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,679
it's 70 30 I think it depends on your

241
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,079
product that's true and that's something

242
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,819
I was going to get at because the reason

243
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:38,549
that the Colorado market is not shopping

244
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,870
at a recreational shop when you're

245
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,458
either and I haven't read this article

246
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,899
in advance very well I skimmed it

247
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,119
because if I found it interesting for

248
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,620
the show I think that a Colorado

249
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,299
resident like you did you became a

250
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,919
resident you got your medical marijuana

251
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,328
recommendation for the doctor you've got

252
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,759
your red card now you can shop at a

253
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:57,588
medical shop and not pay the 25 percent

254
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,700
tax that's added on to the rec weed and

255
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:03,300
probably you get better herb there I

256
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,890
think it's a med shop but also I most of

257
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:08,189
the Colorado residents have been here

258
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:09,990
and we have a guy or a caregiver or just

259
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,940
you've got the photo you're growing your

260
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,299
own or you're growing your own I used I

261
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,310
literally use the rec shops and until I

262
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:20,729
got my red card and then once I got my

263
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:23,039
red card then I I used it all the time

264
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,480
you don't say that I don't I went into

265
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,399
the wreck shop with somebody who just

266
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,709
came here recently and I was looking for

267
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,139
a certain product and that's I went in

268
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,698
there because for one she had never done

269
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,278
it before and it's an experience you

270
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,349
know everybody should go yep there you

271
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,990

275
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,740
stuff I have said on this show that I'm

276
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:54,589
skeptical of topicals and lotions and

277
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,139
such 24 bucks ah this was actually

278
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,120
kicked down by the grimy Gatsby to me

279
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:02,689
because I mentioned some shoulder pain

280
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,509
uh I had a guest over the other night

281

284
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:12,679
they said neck hurts and put some of

285
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,629
this on my hands and rub their neck for

286
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:18,709

294

legs and then like you know if she's

295

continues to say so how did Griego land

311
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,620
at these figures especially given the

312
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,029
state of Colorado's restrictions on

313
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,779
tracking recreational customers

314
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:19,610
information Oh won't we keep seeing

315
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,679
these statistics and that's a question

316
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,700
I've raised twice now all right once and

317
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,289
this is the second time somebody's

318
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,790
raised it for me go for it but you're

319
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:28,250
you've already explained it where

320
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:30,769
they're not tracking your name so much

321
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:34,159
as they're just checking your purchase

322
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:35,870
you know he comments on it so he says we

323
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,819
have a media group that we hired on and

324
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,679
they monitor all of our social media and

325
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,570
Google Analytics and we've paid close

326
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,979
attention to the progression of people

327
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,160
searching on pcs and mobile devices

328
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,960
Griego said a lot of these numbers come

329
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,079
from inside the store everyone has to

330
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,850
show ID and we check IDs twice one

331
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,040
in reception and again in the dispensing

332
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,540
area plus our blood tenders are always

333
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,819
making friendly conversation asking

334
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:00,069
people where they're from sure eighty

335
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,290
percent is griegos educated guess but

336
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,260
while he knows he sees traffic locally

337
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:07,529
as well as from nearby wheel is Colorado

338
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:10,569
towns Colorado Springs walsenburg

339
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:13,000
Trinidad and mahanta he said he says

340
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:16,390
definitively that he sees more Texans

341
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,789

it's a lot of Texans yeah not

346
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,490
surprisingly the out-of-state customers

chronic mazing buy it for medical or 50

378
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,600
but for the fire it's about 200 bucks

379
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,580
225 for a good dank outs right now in

380
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,320
Colorado I was in some you know if you

381
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,940
just random dude if you got the hook up

382
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,190
to you I would rather go 50 bucks

383
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,200
believe me you saw that excellent if you

384
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,900
have to let dank that top shelf cush

385
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,129

386
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,379
dispensaries and get it it's going to

387
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:54,240
run you cold air five dollars an ounce

388
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:57,850
for that same 225 200 all the routes Wow

389
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,200
all right it makes sense but am I guess

390
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,149
it's the Colorado people are getting

391
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,410
that stuff that the caregivers are

392
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,709
growing or their buddies with the

393
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:06,829
caregiver grow or haven't

394
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,030
extra on or something all that private

395
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,970
cushions a little bit better than the

396
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:12,980
shop we'd I think it's harder for

397
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,149
someone to get on with the caregiver you

398
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,120
know especially if you don't have a

399
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:20,629
medical debilitating condition where you

400
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,250
know um I'm not I'm not medical because

401
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,750
I'm in a wheelchair that's for sure you

402
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,370
know or I have cancer it's just knowing

403
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,840
somebody that you trust and want to

404
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,519
assign as your caregiver so here's

405
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,690
something we kind of skipped over guys

406
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:31,879
we were talking about caregiver and

407
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,500
stuff when you get a and now actually

408
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:35,179
word is now provider and Colorado

409
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,440
correct when you're back in the day it

410
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:38,419
was caregiver but that was sounds

411
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,160
confusing when you get your medical

412
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:41,299
marijuana recommendation from a doctor

413
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,620
there is no license it's a

414
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:44,449
recommendation it's not a prescription

415
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,000
they recommend that you use medical

416
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,830
cannabis and they sign papers and you

417
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,450
send that paper into the colorado state

418
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,040
registry and they send you back a card

419
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,690
that is a registry card that says you

420
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,909
are registered with state of colorado to

421
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,380
use medical marijuana when you fill out

422
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:59,870
your paperwork you were allowed to sign

423
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:01,549
designate a person that is called your

424
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,669
provider which used to be your caregiver

425
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:06,199
this person the paperwork says they have

426
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:10,639
to be responsible for something other

427
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,930
than just procuring your cannabis so you

428
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,610
should drive them to their medical

429
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,959
marijuana doctor's appointment you

430
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,490
should probably make them a kale

431
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,530
smoothie and work on their [Â __Â ]

432
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,269
person I said [Â __Â ] against somebody

433
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,799
tweet me and tell me to stop doing that

434
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,889
I'm trying I got a note in front of you

435
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:26,899

448
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:49,579

449
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,990

450
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,000

451
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,340
feel better about that some people that

452
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,779
have aids cancer major [Â __Â ] they don't

453
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,860
have those people they just need someone

454
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,240
to talk to it because a lot of people

455
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,759
are afraid of them once you're sick

456
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,200
people abandon you or you just need any

457
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,789
kind of distance from do we hate I

458
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,440
haven't hurt or you need extra support

459
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:08,420
even if those people are there you can

460
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,160
always use I'm a young energetic

461
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,630
youthful dude with a good attitude I

462
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,880
just spit right across the table at you

463
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,470
my bad so I apologize for that one but I

464
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,150
didn't say [Â __Â ] about it

465
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:22,308
hello waita so I think being a caregiver

466
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,380
that's part of it going and I write down

467
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,939
spiritual counseling on my when they say

468
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,799
what else do you provide as I make

469
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:28,909
smoothies and shakes for these guys that

470
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,679
drive to their appointments and I

471
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:32,990
provide spiritual counseling just being

472
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,059
your friend but so the caregiver is a

473
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:38,900
person that is responsible for providing

474
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:41,029
your medicine the actual Colorado law

475
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,720
does say that they are allowed to charge

476
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:46,970
you money to cover the cost of your

477
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,069
labor and your lights and your expenses

478
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,500
so you're not supposed to profit off of

479
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:54,279
caregiver care get your caregiver ship

480
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,390
all right if your provider ship so uh

481
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:57,980
yeah you can so you can be a caregiver

482
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,150
in the state of Colorado all you have to

483
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,950
do is decide that you want to be a

484
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,280
caregiver and learn how to grow and then

485
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:07,970
find somebody that trusts you enough and

486
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:09,399
then work out something with them the

487
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,808
dispensaries I don't think or the

488
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,309
sinners don't give you a good deal they

489
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:16,009
just give you a little bit of a discount

490
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:17,418
nah my guys the third people that I'm

491
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:19,908
responsible for right now there are four

492
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,559
people and I know pretty much exactly

493
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,940
how much I can predict when they need

494
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,349
medicine I'll be sitting around one

495
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,000
night and go out about time for a

496
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:27,500
patient a to give me a call tomorrow and

497
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,359
i'll put them a little package together

498
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,909
because i know what he needs and we not

499
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:36,229
only that but that way they kind of have

500
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:39,650
more of a specific and exactly what they

501
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:41,720
need you know yea high CBD hi TAS

502
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,538
exactly i grow that tora bora cut

503
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,490
exactly the night nurse was bred for a

504
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:48,589
specific person his two favorite strains

505
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,960
are grateful dog and tora bora and i

506
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:52,459
bred them together basically to make the

507
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,620
perfect medicine for one of my patients

508
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,669
absolutely i went that far for this guy

509
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:57,469
plus i know it's gonna be a killer

510
00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:00,049
string but I mean that was fired that

511
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,669
strain its if you're not probably not

512
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:03,558
gonna go wrong with it and even if you

513
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:04,850
do you know it's a test it's it's dull

514
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,048
an experiment sitting there on the table

515
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:07,908
if you want to give that thing a little

516
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:10,069
smell yeah I've smelled it it's

517
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:12,260
fantastic well thank you that's the

518
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:15,109
night nurse yeah it's definitely frosty

519
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:16,940
but DNA genetics lets me use their Tora

520
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:18,729
Bora they gave me permission to breed

521
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,890
with it I've got their award-winning cut

522
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:24,470
they let me use that to breed to the

523
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,500
Grateful dog and it came out pretty

524
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,778
stinky smells well I'm going to run a

525
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,210
bunch of testers and maybe one day we'll

526
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:35,028
back to market I def I like the leaders

527
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,669
3 and remedies calm because I move the

528
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:39,858
indica smoker whereas you're more of the

529
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:42,288
sativa guy what's weird about me I like

530
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:43,968
indica flowers if I'm going to smoke a

531
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:46,398
joint I wanted to make me sit down and

532
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:48,679
we're out and like why just one joint

533
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:50,058
seems more like sitting in a hammock

534
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,739
with my feet up with the little

535
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:53,808
dreadlock girl cuddled up next to me and

536
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:57,139
some Grateful Dead on the radio and a

537
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:58,878
nice breeze that's smoking a joint dads

538
00:19:57,138 --> 00:20:00,288
are like taking shots I don't drink

539
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:03,288
alcohol but it reminds me of when I used

540
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:05,719
to drink Jagermeister or tequila it's

541
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:07,489
the it's more energetic it makes my head

542
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:09,409
spin a little bit more I don't relax

543
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:11,479
well after dad's it makes me want to do

544
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:13,519
[Â __Â ] unless I take a half gram dab and

545
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:15,048
want to sit down oh my goodness yeah

546
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,298
yeah we won't do that tonight on the

547
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:20,509
show we will do a large domina it's

548
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:22,338
almost time the large dad thing is

549
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:24,169
almost coming to an end I don't feel

550
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:26,838
good about it as I used to I'm getting

551
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:28,849
older I guess your lungs have so many

552
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:30,950
inhales and exhales and I'm assuming by

553
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:34,548
doing a half gram dab I'm probably using

554
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,679
a multiple inhaling exhales for each dab

555
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:38,450
and I'd like to live a little bit longer

556
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,219
than I wanted to when I was a kid I

557
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,098
didn't realize one day I was gonna fall

558
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:45,288
over and die so uh we may do a grand

559
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:47,628
finale we may be like a gram dab or a to

560
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:51,408
Graham dab or something episode 100

561
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:53,269
episodes a long time hey 50 or something

562
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:54,919
we'll gosh brother so this I just want

563
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:56,929
to do it so that that way we can retire

564
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,820
the super large dad thing we can put the

565
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:00,979
dad challenges to arrest and say hey

566
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:04,218
we're all alive and we could do the life

567
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:06,798
challenge after that so we're way off

568
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:09,229
topic on this news thing we've expensive

569
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,658
it could be 200 150 announce but these

570
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:13,489
shots are selling it for 500 now it's

571
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:15,859
close enough so do you think we do too

572
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:17,479
expensive where you live even though

573
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:20,239
it's legal here it's not the cheapest

574
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:22,129
for recreational use yeah but it's

575
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:24,019
available yeah it was an athlete

just paying the extra money or would you

606

00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:08,039
a lot of new van new story a little odd

650
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,019
cast magnets it's going the way it

651
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,190
should these out-of-state consumers

652
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,779
because remember we're talking about

653
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,370
people from out of state that's how far

654
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:16,200
it's been these out-of-state consumers

655
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,669
are spending much more than locals Grego

656
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,049
said they're spending about twice as

657
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:23,220
much as locals about 120 to 140 dollars

658
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:25,139
edibles are the most popular with these

659
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,120
people out of state consumers can buy up

660
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,640
to 7 grams of cannabis total so you see

661
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,289
them by one to two grams of bud and the

662
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,550
rest of their allotment made up of

663
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:36,750
edible products I'm not sure I am not up

664
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:38,579

665
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:42,269

distinguish between the two you know

669

670
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,379

metric gram or whatever you know I mean

675
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:05,699

704
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,079

720

if you're going to California if you're

722
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,600
going to [Â __Â ] Washington we fall into

723
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:43,639
it and laws and procedures because I've

724
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,459
seen people you know four cups bring

725
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,580
right abstention amounts just in their

726
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,769
in their backpacks you know so there is

727
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:53,329
forms and procedures go to that if you

728
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:55,190
really want to do it but you're not

729
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:57,230
going to be like can I bring my quarter

730
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,150
home to Kentucky no you shop at

731
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,829
dispensaries this guy says when people

732
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,269
come in we're all about safety and state

733
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:06,259
compliance and we make sure that the

734
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:08,329
out-of-state consumers are aware that

735
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:13,250
there he says then are aware that

736
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:14,720

737
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,599
written weird but it says there is for

738
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,160
in-state consumption only we also remind

739
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,750
them that they can't do it in public is

740
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,740
that true to the shops remind you that

741
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,700
stuff when you're there because you have

742
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:28,490

743
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,990
not all of them um it just really

744
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,819

00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:15,138
sent an email to jodie emery asking if

794
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:17,989
I'm allowed to play parts of a marc

795
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:20,538
emery video on a podcast and if I am I

796
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:22,159
plan to play a little bit of Mark speech

797
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:24,169
that he gave recently after he was

798
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,339
released from federal prison so I look

799
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:28,189
forward to doing that and he's a drink

800
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:29,838
excuse me one second Adam yeah I watched

801
00:29:28,189 --> 00:29:32,839
this and actually linked it to him it

802
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:37,489
was it a powerful motivating speech he

803
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:39,918
is on the ball and if he does get you

804
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:42,078
know the permission to do it I won't

805
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,999
ruin it for me but it is everybody

806
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:45,408
should watch it you know and if it if it

807
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:47,868
doesn't inspire you to get over take a

808
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,639
risk and just play some of it I'm we can

809
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:52,038
or we can just talk kind of what it's

810
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:53,868
about you know I like I don't really

811
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:56,328
want to talk with life and innovative

812
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:57,738
let's uh you know the audio I don't

813
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:59,479
think we'll be in trouble for I really

814
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:02,269
don't wanna play video on YouTube you

815
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:03,828
don't and I mean let's click over here

816
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:05,088
and pause the music and then I think I'm

817
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:07,278
going to play a little bit of this video

818
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:09,318
I wasn't prepared to do it but we're

819
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,298
talking about it and it's like the thing

820
00:30:09,318 --> 00:30:13,068
to do if you kind of play towards the

821
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:14,479
end of it it would kind of relay the

822
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:16,398
message more of it unless you want to

823
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,348
play the whole video later on how about

824
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,268
I'll play a couple of intro seconds when

825
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:21,708
he takes the mic he was introduced at

826
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:24,588

00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:29,359
transition here that randomly happened

861
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,340
this is marc emery right after he I

862
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:34,399

867
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,430
apologize we'll figure out on the toilet

868
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,920
fun to be me by and i even said that

869
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:47,930
while I was in prison because you know

870
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,310
doing something let's almost use the

871
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,830
word no both doing something on

872
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:53,929
principle late you know giving a good

873
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:56,480
chunk of your life in sacrifice i guess

874
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:58,789
for principle even in prison was highly

875
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,740
regarded you know in the four and a half

876
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:02,960
years I was in prison I really never

877
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,940
heard an unkind word spoken to me by any

878
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,680
inmate and I was in a medium-security

879
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,000
prison for almost all that and a lot of

880
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,100
these people are serving life

881
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,690
imprisonment without parole they've come

882
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:14,149
down from the penitentiary they're

883
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,519
covered in tattoos they're badass dudes

884
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:19,220
a lot of the Marlies they think they are

885
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:22,430
and and they're serving horribly long

886
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,380
sentences by and large for drugs mostly

887
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,910
methamphetamine crack cocaine but

888
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,040
certainly there were many many people

889
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,040
there for marijuana serving 10 15 and

890
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:35,569
even in one case 25 years for marijuana

891
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:37,789
distribution so I was able to be very

892
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:39,388
productive in jail I wrote a lot i

893
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,729
blogged I

894
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:43,168
read a book every week I had 25 magazine

895
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:46,859
subscriptions I got the new york times

896
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:48,869
every day I learned how to play the bass

897
00:32:46,858 --> 00:32:50,608
guitar was in an outstanding rock and

898
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:53,638
roll band of incredibly talented

899
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:55,949
musicians and and all of them are very

900
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:59,608
patient in teaching me at no charge for

901
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:02,578
anything music and music principles and

902
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:04,348
how to be a bass guitarist and I must

903
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:05,940
tell you that it was a very redemptive

904
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:08,848
and meaningful experience being in

905
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,798
prison and i hope i always carry the

906
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:13,828
message forward that i saw there that

907
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,749
you know it is a very wrong society that

908
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:18,058
punishes people for drugs and put some

909
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:19,709
in jail for decades it takes them away

910
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:22,288
from their family and their children and

911
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:24,538
essentially ruins their life because of

912
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:26,608
a lifestyle choice they made and we

913
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:28,368
manufacture crime with the drug laws we

914
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:31,108
actually by kaz marc emery can talk

915
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:32,999
quite a while and i kind of fade out

916
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:34,138
Adams telling me that I should play the

917
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:35,608
stuff at the end of the video because

918
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:37,558
it's a lot more moving and compelling

919
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:38,759
I'm gonna save that I'm going to talk a

920
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,558
little bit i'm gonna make sure that i

921
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:42,450
can get permission that was about a

922
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,158
minute and a half there i hope i don't

923
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:46,259
get in any kind of trouble if they take

924
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,028
down this episode i apologize all it was

925
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:50,940
was some news in a marc emery rant

926
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:52,919
anyone you would echo way we cut that

927
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,838
out we'll fix it that's right good idea

928
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,719
to go watch the video the message the

929
00:33:54,838 --> 00:33:59,519
message after he gets through this what

930
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:02,399
i did in jail stuff you know and I mean

931
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,038
that's moving trust me but his message

932
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,108
towards the end is definitely what you

933
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:11,009
need to hear and it's what we need to do

934
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:12,719
so take them take the video take 30

935
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:14,818
minutes and watch it ya feelin me up

936
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,500
well I was lying i apologize if they let

937
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:17,878

Denver ah part of this article I'm going

944
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:33,329
to kind of paraphrase it because it's a

945
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,588
lot of stuff enough so it's getting long

946
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:37,019
already I got a couple more things I

947
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:38,699

published August twelfth that's by Aleta

950
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:47,239
lebec from the cannabis staff I didn't

Library and their big cages that look

959
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,119
like your hamster cage and they call it

960
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:15,570

says don't be a lab rat and it's on the

962
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,350
inside it's got a little thing that

963
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:21,239
tells you about cannabis and the

964
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:23,789
problems that cannabis can cause you and

965
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:26,099

lab rat looking cage with the giant

969
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,160
looks like those water bottles that hang

970
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:39,539
upside down that your hamster licks to

971
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,039
get water and then it's got a little

972
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:43,829
green thing on the outside that talks

973
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,699
about cannabis on it a little note if

974
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:45,719

975
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,189
computer Brown take a look it's

977
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:52,079

978
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:54,150
people cage for hamsters or a hamster

979
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,059
cage for people's it is a people cage it

980
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,860
is a people cage and so the article says

981
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:00,750
well that didn't take long the state of

982
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,000
Colorado debuted don't be a lab rat

983
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,099
youth campaign on Monday August eleventh

984
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,469
by dropping human-sized laboratory cages

985
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,239
around the Denver area including outside

986
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:12,899
the Denver Public Library and the

987
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:15,239
downtown skatepark vandalize vandalized

988
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,360
signs at the skate park installation

989
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,889
reported Monday evening by CBS for the

990
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,809
cages featured posters it's like

991
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:23,849
controversial marijuana research studies

992
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:26,699
and ask open-ended questions about about

993
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:29,069
pot use about youth pot use sorry those

994
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:31,259
the heart sentence some cleverly crossed

995
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,030
out a reference to negative effects of

996
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,820
marijuana and changed it to positive

997
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,980
although another message left on the

998
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,730
poster says critically smoking weed

999
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:43,650
saved my life the campaign which targets

1000
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,869
teens with messages that marijuana

1001
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,840
research is ongoing particularly in

1002
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:51,059
studies of studies of the developed

1003
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:54,030
developing brain is trying a different

1004
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,980
tact from the just say no anti-drug

1005
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,810
campaigns of your there are a few

1006
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,510
variations of the posters that adorn the

1007
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:02,250
giant cages so a new message is sure to

1008
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,770
replace the vandalized signs the

1009
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,239
vandalism was taken in stride by dr.

1010
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:07,079
Luri walk who leads the State Health

1011

Department

1012
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,219
if they are defacing it or they're doing

1013
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,959
something with regard to graffiti or

1014
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:15,679
gathering in the cages at least they're

1015
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:18,208
taking notice and let the debate occur

1016
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:20,788
but probably just breaking that [Â __Â ]

1017
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:23,728
while they're smoking a joint to be

1018
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:25,739
perfectly honest um there was also the

1019
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:27,478
man who coked up inside the cage at the

1020
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:30,119
skate park according to the TV station

1021
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:32,038
report so somebody was but that's what I

1022

1042
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:21,479
haven't seen these gigantic lab rat

1043
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:23,728
cages it's quite entertaining they've

1044
00:38:21,478 --> 00:38:25,649
posted some three or four stories on the

1045
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:27,358
cannabis about it we down there the

1046
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,039
other day I would have liked you know

1047
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,018
that a good idea we should have gone and

1048
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,069
checked it out if you want to jump

1049
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:34,048
around on this night again and take a

1050
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:35,219
look there's actually people inside of

1051
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:37,139
this one as they were building it

1052
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:39,298
they're almost the email out of the way

1053
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:42,719
that's that's the people cage they're

1054
00:38:39,298 --> 00:38:44,670
working with right there it's

1055
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,858
essentially a lion cage from the zoo

1056
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:49,559
yeah it's a lion it looks like a lion

1057
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:52,619
cage it looks like a large cat small

1058
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:54,359
enclosure there's that 10 x 10 x 10 x 10

1059
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:57,028
x 10 yeah but then I don't even think

1060
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:58,440
that it's probably 12 x 10 okay you know

1061
00:38:57,028 --> 00:39:03,088
saying it's probably longer than it is

1062
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,849
wider but yeah and there's a lot of

1063
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:08,518
scrutiny about how kind of ridiculous it

1064
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:10,709
is to from a lot of people by the looks

1065
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:12,208
of these websites so let me click and

1066
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:14,088
see how long we're going on here in a

1067
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:17,368
jail fill

1068
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:19,139
I'm of them and just gonna keep moving

1069
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:20,849
on with that one we are about 40 minutes

1070
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:22,440
in so we can keep going I got a couple

1071
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:24,630
we can make this a perfect our I bet if

1072
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,920
we do this right all right all right

1073
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,380
I'll try to save a couple of minutes for

1074
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,619
the Marc Emery part if we get a chance

1075
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,358
to do that so this is something random

1076
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,338
and this only support i'm reading this

1077
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,889
because this supports the legalization

1078
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:40,139

1079
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:42,000

1233
00:45:42,748 --> 00:45:46,228
couple times on this article so the oil

1234
00:45:45,028 --> 00:45:48,568
doesn't have the psychoactive properties

1235
00:45:46,228 --> 00:45:50,929
they get users high and can be mixed

1236
00:45:48,568 --> 00:45:54,170
with foods such as applesauce

1237
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:57,230
um I wonder if they'd be able to bring

1238
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:59,210
back the og caps because those og calves

1239
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,769
from essential extracts available at

1240
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:03,559
natural mystic cannabis caregivers which

1241
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:05,509
is a medical shop man so they're gonna

1242
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:07,130
have to get a Colorado residency and get

1243
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,920
a medical marijuana card in Colorado to

1244
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,838
even acquire this type of medicine Utah

1245
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,240
maybe not indifferent you know maybe

1246
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:17,239
there's something a little more yeah

1247
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,618
hopefully nowadays all right we'll keep

1248
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,058
going the cost of cannon bitty all

1249
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:21,440
varies depending on the size of the

1250
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:22,700
patient and the level of the dose the

1251
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,960
patient is receiving for

1252
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:26,239
one-hundred-pound person a month supply

1253
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,280
of the beginning dose is about 40 bucks

1254
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,019
a maximum dose for the same patient

1255
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,210

1256
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:36,608

Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake

City one families receive a registration

1295
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:56,179
card it could face additional herders to

1296
00:47:53,449 --> 00:47:57,949
hurdles to actually get the extract from

1297
00:47:56,179 --> 00:48:00,379
other states including enrolling in that

1298
00:47:57,949 --> 00:48:02,118
state's medical marijuana program all

1299
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,588
state marijuana programs medical or

1300
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:04,369

federal law

1302
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:08,329
and some doctors and advocacy groups

1303
00:48:06,018 --> 00:48:11,298
have warned there's no proof the extract

1304
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:13,278
is effective at treating epilepsy but

1305
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:15,409
family say it's worth the time and cost

1306
00:48:13,278 --> 00:48:18,380
if it brings relief to those suffering

1307
00:48:15,409 --> 00:48:20,328
from seizures all right do you think

1308
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,338
these people are gonna pay four hundred

1309
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:23,809
dollars or now two hundred dollars to

1310
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:26,389
get the medical marijuana card that they

1311
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:28,819
require and then go spend money in

1312
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:31,759
another state they're going to travel to

1313
00:48:28,818 --> 00:48:34,130
Colorado to get this oil that costs up

1314
00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:36,619
to nine hundred dollars for a freakin

1315
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:38,298
dose of month does they're going to

00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,220
all be legal no one will ever try and

1449
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:46,049
ban them ever again no one will ever say

1450
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:48,239
a bad thing about pot smokers as a

1451
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:52,260
culture as a way of demonizing them and

1452
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:56,519
sending them to jail because mark in 25

1453
00:53:52,260 --> 00:54:00,060
years that one day everybody showed up

1454
