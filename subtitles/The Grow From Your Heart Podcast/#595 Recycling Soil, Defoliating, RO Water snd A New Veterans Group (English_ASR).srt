very intense i wanted to remind you to

61
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,679

65
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,078
shake it off remember it's the holiday

66
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,560
season everybody is stressed to the

67
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,478
limit

68
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
it's been a weird year for everybody

69
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,519
don't let that little tiny bit of [ __ ]

70
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,879
tip you at the end of the year

71
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,158
we're gonna get a fresh new year here

72
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,759
pretty soon hopefully we're gonna get

73
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,320
some sort of a [ __ ] break

74
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,759
2020 is almost over 2021 is going to be

75
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,959
a fresh start there's only a few more

76
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,080
days left of this year

77
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,598
then maybe we can get rid of this

78
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,719
[ __ ] curse or whatever happened to us

79
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,959

80
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,560

00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,878
ez057 a big thank you shout out

109
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,000
i've been getting a lot of messages from

110
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,039
people who've been following the show

111
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,280
for a long time

112
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,280
and they say hey bro i really miss the

113
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,199
rasta flag in your podcast

114
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,360
when i rebuilt the studio i got a lot of

115
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,439
brand new equipment we painted the walls

116
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,519
i didn't feel it was appropriate to hang

117
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,680
the rasta flag back on the wall i love

118
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
the flag i love the rasta culture

119
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,120
rastafari through and through but the

120
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,119
flag was a little bit

121
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,878
uh maybe a little bit juvenile for the

122
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,239
podcast so i took it down and i did not

123
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,439
re-hang it it is hung somewhere else

124
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,120
where i see it every day

125
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,719
i get to see my rasta flag but it's not

126
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239
up for the show i felt like when i

127
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,000
upgraded the show i wanted something a

128
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,360
little bit classier i wasn't sure what

129
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,479
was going to go up on the wall

130
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,239
and our friend ez057 took initiative and

131
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,119
sent me a wonderful gift i'm sure you

132
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,039

better than i could even imagine and

140
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,239

169
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,240

i don't know if you notice but i notice

176
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,279
it i am recording with a brand new

177
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,959
camera setting i'm still learning this

178
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,879
sony a64 cam

179
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,319
uh if you love or hate this camera

180
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,600
setting let me know

181
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,879
i don't know what it's going to look

182
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
like until i start doing color

183
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,038
correcting

184
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,320
what i see on my little screen there is

185
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,360
always different compared to what i see

186
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,879
on my big screen

187
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
there will be some color correcting some

188
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,719
editing to be done the bottom line is

189
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
i'm using a new setting if you hate it

190
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
let me know

191
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,960
if you love it let me know i may take

192
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,160
your feedback i may just keep doing my

193
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,560
own thing but i'd like to know what you

194
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
think

195
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,918
i'd like to know if you liked it before

196
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,279
or now or just give me some feedback i'm

197
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,639
still learning this equipment

198
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,399
your input means a lot to me you're the

199
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,199
one watching so let me know what you

200
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,038
think

201
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,400
where are we going from there the next

202
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,360
important thing to talk about is

203
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,959
cannabis

204
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,879
if you're following me on cannabis you

205
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,279
know that cannabis has recently changed

206
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,439
the way they do their direct messaging

207
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,239
until yesterday you were able to direct

208
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,839
message anybody else on the cannabis app

209
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
let me back up cannabis is a free

210
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,799
application available for your android

211
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,639
or apple device

212
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
it's a cannabis friendly social media

213
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,400
application you can't buy sell

214
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,240
or trade cannabis there but you can post

215
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,679
your cannabis related content you can

216
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
post your dab videos

217
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,600
you can post your garden pictures post

218
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
all kinds of cannabis related content

219
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,120
and unlike many of the other popular

220
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,080
social media platforms you will not be

221
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
scrutinized

222
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,599
however if you do go posting a bunch of

223
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,519
booty pics and a bunch of porn and stuff

224
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,199
they will politely ask you to stop doing

225
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,318
that because that is not what the app is

226
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,160
for

227
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,840
some people have taken advantage of the

228
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,160
app they have found some loopholes

229
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,159
and they begin direct messaging people

230
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,520
and asking for money and sending porn

231
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,720
and a bunch of spam so

232
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,959
cannabis was forced to minimize the

233
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,639
direct messaging interactions what they

234
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,359
have done is now you can only message

235
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,240
somebody

236
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,759
if you are mutually mutually following

237
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
each other which means i have to follow

238
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,000
you

239
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240
and you have to follow me if we want to

240
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,639
direct message each other

241
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,800
i no offense to anybody's account i

242
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,639
don't want to follow all 30 000 of the

243
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,439
people on cannabis that makes my feed a

244
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,038
mess

245
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,719
we are selective about who we follow

246
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,159
because we want to see certain pictures

247
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,759
that's what social media is for i want

248
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,199
to see certain things

249
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,038
it's not that i don't want to see your

250
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
picks it's just i'm more focused on

251
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,318
certain people's content it's curated

252
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
content for what i like

253
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,479
i don't want to be required to follow i

254
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,439
think there are about 30 to 40 000 users

255
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,680
on cannabis

256
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,759
i'm not going to follow 40 000 people i

257
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,038
was following about 60 because i enjoy

258
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,319
those accounts it's a new app they're

259
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,719
still building accounts

260
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
my point is i cannot direct message with

261
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,759
you unless we are mutually following

262
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,598
each other so it is

263
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,199
drastically and greatly limited the

264
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,079
amount of interactions i can have

265
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,080
on cannabis i'm not ignoring you i'm not

266
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,680
blocking you i'm not dodging you

267
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,839
that is a feature that had to be turned

268
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,280
on on cannabis to protect the cannabis

269
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,519
community i will admit

270
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,279
i was upset i was frustrated at first i

271
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,799
felt like i was being [ __ ] blocked

272
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,239
i felt like a lot of my interactions

273
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,840
were going to be limited i felt like i

274
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
kind of abandoned my community

275
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,359
i've got an open door policy if you send

276
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,000
me a message on cannabis it may take me

277
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,919
a couple of days

278
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,279
but i will reply to that message up

279
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,079
until now now i won't even get your

280
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,159
message

281
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,758
but i feel like i blocked off a large

282
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,360
member of my community i was

283
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,560
on cannabis from the beginning a lot of

284
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
people really appreciated the

285
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,519
interactions we were having there

286
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,199
and now those interactions are not

287
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,439
possible it was

288
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,038
necessary at first i was upset now i

289
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,839
understand it was necessary our

290
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,598
community was

291
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,279
at risk people were getting spammed

292
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,038
people were getting scammed

293
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,198
uh there was content happening that we

294
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,000
did not support or promote or condone on

295
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,840
cannabis

296
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
so corrections needed to be made this is

297
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,359
only temporary

298
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,199
the development team is working on new

299
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
things to get us around this problem but

300
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
until then

301
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,680
we're going to have to minimize the way

302
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,199
we message each other this may not

303
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,598
affect a lot of users

304
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
uh i have a larger account than many uh

305
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,240
folks on there so my account was

306
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,759
affected more by this

307
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,918
but it will affect everybody who was

308
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,759
relying on me for a grow question if we

309
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,598
were having a conversation or something

310
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,599
we can't communicate now so that has

311
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,080
limited us i do apologize there is a way

312
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
around

313
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,759
this until this is fixed if you've got

314
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
an urgent grow question that you were

315
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,120
going to ask me on cannabis

316
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
all you have to do is send me an email

317
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,919
my email address of course is grow from

318
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,278

at hotmail.com that will get to me also

320
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,879
i am getting a ton of emails from the

321
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,958

322

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,760
successful my brand wouldn't be crushing

341
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,679

342
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,120

343
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,838

344
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,320

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,720
i will get to you so if you can't

346
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,320
message me on cannabis please do not

347
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
abandon cannabis people are saying i'm

348
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,399
ditching the service because of this

349
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,319
don't do that

350
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,480
this is a temporary problem that will

351
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,640
have a real solution and things will be

352
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,639
much better once that solution comes

353
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,240
i know that cannabis is working on quite

354
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,679
a few updates that are coming in the

355
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,039
future the development team

356
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,039
takes some time to get stuff going it

357
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,439
costs money to do things all of this

358
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,838
stuff

359
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
and covet is slowing everything down so

360
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,720
once they get the

361
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,240
messaging fixed also another feature

362
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,480
that is coming is uh

363
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,919
the live chat i can do a live video on

364
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,440
cannabis and i can go talk and i can

365
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,559
hang out but you guys cannot chat and

366
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,160
interact with me

367
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,359
in the future that will be interactive

368
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,719
i'll be able to see the comments you're

369
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
leaving and i can reply to them just

370
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
like that other app that i use on

371
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,278
mondays

372
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,160
so please don't abandon cannabis i know

373
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:19,759

374

443
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
there i wrote mid

444
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,039
topic this isn't the main topic this is

445
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,440
the pre main topic

446
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,278
uh recently somebody was saying that if

447
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,240
cannabis was going to minimize messaging

448
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,639
maybe we should do

449
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,399
discord and then i opened up my message

450
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,079
box and i got this message we're just

451
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,600
going to jump right into it it goes

452
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,199

459
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,680

461
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,838
it says i am the opposite of most of

462
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,120
your veteran emails i am not looking for

463
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,279
someone to help me out

464
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
rather i am looking to help out other

465
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,399
veterans in your group

466
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,039
this is in reference to i asked uh so

467
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,120
a while back we asked to get help for a

468
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,759
grow light for a veteran in need

469
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,959
and um our friends at black sail market

470
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,519
shout out to keith from black sail

471
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,919
market

472
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,959
keith was able to donate a light to a

473
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,599
disabled veteran

474
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,439
in need and that veteran got seeds and a

475
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,360
light and a lot of useful advice

476
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,480
and they are now growing with a canon

477
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,399
led light

478
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,159
thanks to a very uh generous

479
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,120
contribution from our friend at black

480
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,799
sail market

481
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,039
so this veteran wants to kind of

482
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,120
continue that trend

483
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,719
it says growing this plant the past few

484
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,919
years has saved my life

485
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,839
and helped me to stop drinking non-stop

486
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,198
i understand that to be quite honest

487
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,320
with you before i got my medical

488
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,799
marijuana card

489
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,800
i was a sloppy drunk when i got my

490
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,799
medical marijuana card i told myself if

491
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,559
i get this card and i can go to the weed

492
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,719
store every day and buy as much cannabis

493
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,759
as i want there's no reason to drink

494
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,959
and at that point i quit drinking so in

495
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,958
a similar sense

496
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,719
cannabis saved my life because if i

497
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,239
would have kept drinking i would be

498
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,320
dead or in jail or would have hurt

499
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,919
somebody i probably would have gotten a

500
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
dui by now it would have gotten in a

501
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,559
fight i would have done something stupid

502
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
with as much as i drank

503
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,319
i'm six foot five and nearly 200 pounds

504
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,919
me and whiskey were good friends and

505
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,959
that [ __ ] did not work out very well

506
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,838
toward the end of the night

507
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,359
uh so yeah i do agree with you that uh

508
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,480
quitting alcohol and switching over to

509
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,560
cannabis full-time

510
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,680
probably saved both of our lives so uh

511
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,319
it's good to hear that brother i'm glad

512
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,919
you were

513
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,079
alcohol-free and i'm glad you're on team

514
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,159

630
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,599
i've got to find the legal guidelines

631
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,119
and see how much trouble i can and

632
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,879
cannot get in by doing this

633
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,319
but i will make the group it will happen

634
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,480
and we will get some gear

635
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,319
into the hands of veterans in need these

636
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
people served our country

637
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,359
like i've said before i don't agree with

638
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,880
war i don't think shooting people and

639
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,599
bombing people is cool

640
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,120
but if somebody's got to do it i have

641
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,639
huge respect for the people that put

642
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,439
their lives on the line they sign up to

643
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,799
go do that

644
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,558
because if you start throwing grenades

645
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,279
at me and shooting at me i'm running

646
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:04,720
that way

647
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,960
these gentlemen and ladies they're

648
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,038
running that way into the [ __ ] fire

649
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,000
that is [ __ ] brave that is honorable

650
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,440
that is commendable

651
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,279
they've done a lot of work let's get

652
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,240
them some gear let's get them growing so

653
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,720

654
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,400
anxiety depression ptsd and not drink

655
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,000
themselves into a stupor

656
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,160
not dole themselves out with a bunch of

657
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,880
pills let's help the people who keep us

658
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,279

666
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,759
interact with all of the messages i try

667

i am in constant go mode i'm not

669
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,880

670
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,879
idle hands or the devil's playground

671
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,720

00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,200
thing once i create it introduce a few

678
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,159
people i want to be able to step back

679
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,558

get to growers

698
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080

bro that is nice here in colorado we get

766
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,199
six recreational plants and if you're a

767
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,119
medical marijuana patient you get six

768
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,840
more so we're allowed 12 plants per

769
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,359
household

770
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,639
there's no tricks you can do to get more

771
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,038
we used to be able to play some tricks

772
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,559

773
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,400
run some numbers and do some things and

774
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,480

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,359
at this point so yes

832
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,038
it is getting hit very hard it says i am

833
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,399
very fortunate to be in my current

834
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,119
situation which has left me

835
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,720
better off than most uh isn't it great

836
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,839
when people realize that they are better

837
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,558
off than most and it's such a good

838
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,240
feeling

839
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,319
to see you're like man i'm doing pretty

840
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,000
good for myself and to acknowledge that

841
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,678
you're doing better off than most if

842
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
that's a compassionate thing

843
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,080
i'm rambling today but we're gonna stay

844
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,798
focused it says but to show my support

845
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,879
and thanks

846
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,400
i have increased my patreon subscription

847
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,440
although small it still helps

848
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,440
i am sure uh tonto you're a family man

849
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,960
and just the fact that you are able to

850
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,640
contribute at all and you

851
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,840
volunteered to do so that means a lot to

852
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,120
me so don't ever feel like your

853
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,480
contribution is little

854
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,399
nobody out there feel like your

855
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,759
contribution is little some people give

856
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
a dollar some people give a hundred

857
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,640
dollars

858
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,038
ah i love the people that give me a

859
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,038
dollar as much as the people who give me

860
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,158
one hundred dollars some of those people

861
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,839
that give me a dollar

862
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,278
may have two dollars and they gave me

863
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,319
one of them some of those people that

864
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:21,679
have a hundred dollars

865
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:23,839
may have a hundred and one and they gave

866
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,159
me a hundred of them that means a lot to

867
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,240
me

868
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,679
just one dollar and a hundred dollars i

869
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,278
know it probably feels weird to the

870
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,798
people who gave me 100 to say that

871
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,400
you mean as much to me if you gave me

872
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,319
one or if you gave me a hundred i

873
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,798
appreciate love and respect you just the

874
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,558
same

875
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,240
but i do see the different contributions

876
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,440
i don't try to judge you for it i

877
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,798
appreciate it all

878
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,480
uh that just sounds weird because now

879
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,918
the people that gave me more feel like i

880
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,240
don't respect them more but

881
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,600
uh don't worry i think they get it i'm

882
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
going to try to talk myself out of this

883
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,678
circle

884
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,919
um let's jump back into the email that's

885
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,120
a good way to do it uh it says i do have

886
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,799
a couple of questions

887
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,239
i was hoping you could answer these for

888
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,000
me i have searched the internet for

889
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,519
answers but the information wasn't

890
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,319
available and yes when you do find the

891
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,519
information

892
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,519
you're going to find one article that

893
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,879
contradicts the article that you thought

894
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,240
was working and then another article

895
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,120
that will really spin your mind and give

896
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,720
you different ideas

897
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,399
so the internet can be really

898
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,839
challenging to find new information i'm

899
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,038
glad you reached out to me because i can

900
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,480
give you real advice

901
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,759
it says i didn't trust the internet and

902
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,720
there was no real source for the

903
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,240
information

904
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,159
you have mentioned in your episodes that

905
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,200
you remove any large fan leaves with a

906
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,278
purple stem

907
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,880
i'm curious as to why because that is

908
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,240
the first time i heard it and i've been

909
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
curious since i heard it

910
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,880
i've been doing a bit more defoliation

911
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,120
every grow as i get more confident

912
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,559
okay so the question is in a recent

913
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,558
episode i've said to

914
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,319
when you are defoliating to defoliate

915
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,319
any leaf with a purple stem

916
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,158
and our friend tonto is asking why i

917
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,599
take off the leaves with the purple

918
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,320
stems

919
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,000
the main basic reason that i say remove

920
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,200
the leaves with the purple stems

921
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,519
is that is a very trainable task if i

922
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,120
say

923
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,879
all right guys we're going to our gals

924
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,879
guys and gals grow team

925
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,278
we're going to defoliate this whole room

926
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,080
today i want you to go in and take off

927
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,919
every leaf with a purple pedial that is

928
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,839
really easy to follow that's a really

929
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,120
easy guideline a really easy instruction

930
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,439
you can visually see

931
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,558
purple pedial break it off not purple

932
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,960
keep moving purple

933
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,839
break it off and it makes it real easy

934
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,240
real trainable

935
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,439
for anybody to understand that now why

936
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,200
do i want those

937
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,360
leaves gone is the next part of this

938
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,200
question usually

939
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,719
if the leaf has developed a purple

940
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,519
petiole or pedial however you want to

941
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,360
pronounce it

942
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,359
that is probably a big enough leaf that

943
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,439
it is blocking something beneath it

944
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,199
and that bud site below should be

945
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,960
getting the light that this big leaf is

946
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,798
blocking so if you got a big leaf here

947
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,319
you got a bud development here this

948
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:39,918
pedial is probably purple

949
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,678
go ahead and pull that leaf off that

950
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,038
light is now going to hit this bud this

951
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,919
bud's going to get those uh

952
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,440
the ppfd that photon energy and that bud

953
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,759
will grow bigger and fatter

954
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,519
so that is why i remove those big leaves

955
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,640
with the purple pedials those are older

956
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,599
leaves

957
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,120
they are thicker they're probably uh if

958
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,599
you're going to get a deficiency or a

959
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,798
problem

960
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,959
those are the leaves that it's going to

961
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,119
show up on first those are where the

962
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,880
spider mites the powdery mildew go first

963
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,959
if we get rid of those leaves that are

964
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,960
those are less hotels for bugs

965
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,558
less opportunities for powdery mildew

966
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,079
and those are the oldest and biggest

967
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,839
leaves that are blocking the light

968
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,519
so there are several reasons why i'm

969
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,759
taking those out of there mainly

970
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,558
to stop blocking the light and also it

971
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,480
will help with

972
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,599
humidity problems and a giant grow we

973
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,278
get a lot of respiration and

974
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,798
transpiration in a giant grow

975
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,319
without that many leaves you're not

976
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:26,720
releasing that much moisture into the

977
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,240
air

978
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,798
it will help you out and we're also

979
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,960
mitigating bug problems at the same time

980
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,879
so the reason i say purple petioles is

981
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,558
because those are the bigger leaves

982
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,000
and those are the older leaves and those

983
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,079
are most likely the leaves

984
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,599
blocking my developing bud sites i hope

985
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,519
i made that one clear for you

986
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,278
because there are more parts to this

987
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,440
question it says could you

988
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,798
explain or point to me a podcast about

989
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,558
reusing soil

990
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,038
i'd like to be more eco-friendly and

991
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,759
save a bit i would like to reuse my soil

992
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,720
if there are not too many cons to doing

993
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,158
so

994
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,399
okay recycling and reusing soil can be

995
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,360
very cost effective it can also be very

996
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,678
dangerous

997
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,519
if you had any problems in your grill if

998
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,519
you saw one bug i don't care if it was a

999
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,679
thrip a spider mite or a fungus gnat

1000
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,119
i would reconsider recycling the soil

1001
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,360
and not do that

1002
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,359
if you did not have any problems in your

1003
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,158
grow through the entire grow

1004
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,678
then you can consider recycling the soil

1005
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,799
in part of your message you do tell me

1006
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,679
that you were using

1007
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,519
hp pro mix with added perlite one of the

1008
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,360
first things that comes to mind is

1009
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,278
if you do recycle that soil it's going

1010
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,240
to be dead there's nothing in there it

1011
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,119
is basically

1012
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,960
just a little bag of dirt to hold your

1013
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,759
roots there's no living stuff in there

1014
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
because

1015
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,798
at the end of your last cycle you should

1016
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,639
have flushed heavily

1017
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,000
you removed all of the bottled nutrients

1018
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,759
all the built up salts

1019
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,839
all the stuff that was in that soil you

1020
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,919
have washed it out you've basically got

1021
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,839
a bag of dirt at this point

1022
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,440
there's nothing living in there if

1023
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,359
you're using the pro mix you've washed

1024
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,519
all that stuff out so

1025
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,839
the very first thing i would recommend

1026
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,960
is you need to reactivate that soil with

1027
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,119
some microbes

1028
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,798
i would put probably some recharge in

1029
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,798
there big shout out to scotty reel

1030
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,720
i would put some recharge in that soil i

1031
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,278
would honestly uh

1032
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,038
rinse out that soil so let me back up

1033
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,960
get your harvest your plants

1034
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,398
you've got your soil you got your three

1035
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,079
or five gallon pot do you tell me what

1036
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,119
size pots you use

1037
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,000
um doesn't look like it you've got your

1038
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,759
pots of soil

1039
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,679
dump those pots of soil into a big

1040
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,839
container uh remove

1041
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,120
the big root balls if you can get as

1042
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,759
much of the big stuff out of there as

1043
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,839
you can

1044
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,440
get a claw type thing and just break it

1045
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,959
up i forget with the that claw looking

1046
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,159
thing use two of those with both hands

1047
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,079
and just get in there break all that

1048
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,360
soil up the best you can pull out all

1049
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,918
the big root balls

1050
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,719
then when you re-pop the pots i would

1051
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,960
water them

1052
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,079
before you even put plants in there mix

1053
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,519
up a batch of water

1054
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,359
and put the recommended amount of

1055
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,000
recharge in that water and water

1056
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,240
that through your plants also maybe put

1057
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,240
some enzymes in that same mix what we're

1058
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,798
doing now is we're reactivating that

1059
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,399
water

1060
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,639
we're going to get some microbial life

1061
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,199
into that soil if you put some enzymes

1062
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,880
in there

1063
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,720
those enzymes will help break down all

1064
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,159
the old dead decaying [ __ ] that is left

1065
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,759
behind from your old plants

1066
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,080
it will actually turn that stuff into

1067
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,720
usable food for your new plants that go

1068
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,960
in there

1069
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,919
so i would cut down the plants pull out

1070
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,278
the root balls

1071
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,960
break up the dirt put it into a

1072
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:18,000
container stir it up real good get it

1073
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,960
all mixed

1074
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,519
maybe consider adding a percentage of

1075
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,720
fresh

1076
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,319
soil to this mix i say that because that

1077
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,278
old soil is burnt it's dead there's

1078
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,200
nothing in there

1079
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,640
maybe add some fresh soil add some more

1080
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
perlite just to give it a little bit of

1081
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,799
life

1082
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,240
so then once you've got that all mixed

1083
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,839
in put it into your pots i don't know if

1084
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,200
you're using threes fives or sevens but

1085
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,199
put it into the pots

1086
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,519
then water those pots with recharge and

1087
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,519
enzymes that is going to reactivate your

1088
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,200
soil and revitalize your soil

1089
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,038
now you are back to that original pro

1090
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,080
mix because that pro-mix is sold with

1091
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:49,359
mycorrhizal mix

1092
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,240
inside of there so you need to add

1093
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,639
something to get you back to ground zero

1094
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,159
so we've got it all cleaned up uh we've

1095
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,240
got it re-uh

1096
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,000
my code we've got an enzyme to start

1097
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,679
cleaning stuff out i think that is going

1098
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,240
to work safely for you

1099
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,000
in my opinion that is probably the most

1100
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,440
effective and efficient way to do it

1101
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,119
make sure that you flushed heavily

1102
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,558
before you harvested make sure you get

1103
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,918
all those root balls out of there

1104
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:13,759
put some micros in there put some

1105
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,960
enzymes in there before you plant your

1106
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,278
plants water it once

1107
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,440
maybe water it twice let it dry then do

1108
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,398
your normal transplant method

1109
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,759
but if you had any bugs any problems i

1110
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,798
would not do this

1111
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,359
this is much much easier in cocoa than

1112
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,558
it is

1113
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,599
in soil or soilless mix in cocoa cocoa

1114
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:32,879
doesn't hold anything

1115
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,480
you can run a bunch of water through the

1116
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,080
cocoa and all the nutrients all the

1117
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,319
stuff will strip right out of there

1118
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,839
then you can measure the ec or the ph or

1119
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,200
the ppms of the water that's coming out

1120
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,599
and you can tell there's nothing left in

1121
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,558
there

1122
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,879
that's not as easy in soil or dirt but i

1123
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:46,720
think

1124
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,880
you will be successful i know you're a

1125
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,038
smart guy so i'm sure you will know

1126
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,559
this is probably good soil to recycle or

1127
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,480
bad soil to recycle

1128
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,678
you can tell if you had bugs if you had

1129
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,120
problems that's when you're not going to

1130
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,320
want to do it if it looks healthy if it

1131
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,678
feels good in your hands

1132
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,960
go ahead and do it if it doesn't feel

1133
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,919
good to your hands if it doesn't feel

1134
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,919
good in your heart

1135
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,278
avoid it i think you will know better

1136
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,679
where do we go from there because there

1137
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,960
are more parts to this question

1138
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,440
all right the next part of the message

1139
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,759
says during covet 19 my access to ro

1140
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,679
water from the store could be restricted

1141
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,319
if the situation arises that i cannot

1142
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,679
get ro would the calcium buildup do any

1143
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,759
harm in my veg tint

1144
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,038
or would it just build white powder on

1145
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,278
everything

1146
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,919
that's a really good question honestly i

1147
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,919
do not use ro water in my personal grows

1148
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,038
i don't use ro water in most of my

1149
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,799
commercial grows

1150
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,640
here in colorado we've got pretty good

1151
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,038
pretty clean water

1152
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,360
at the commercial grows i use a big boy

1153
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,119
filter that's all i use it is not ro

1154
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,558
in a personal grow i use it straight

1155
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,558
from the hose so

1156
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,079
i am not using ro water and i do not

1157
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,678
experience any issues

1158
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,278
auro water kind of makes things a little

1159
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,759
bit more challenging because it's harder

1160
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:51,519
to

1161
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,359
adjust the ph there's no buffering in

1162
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,000
there so i think you will be

1163
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,839
just fine if you are not able to get to

1164
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,480
your ro water especially if you're using

1165
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,359
the

1166
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,240
hp pro mix and the nutrients you listed

1167
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:05,119
there will be

1168
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,640
no problems not using the ro water you

1169
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,319
may need to

1170
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,000
adjust the amount of calmag you were

1171
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,240
feeding the plants because that calmag

1172
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,200
is and the calcium is actually in the

1173
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
oral water

1174
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,640
but i don't think it will make a huge

1175
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,558
difference pay attention to that

1176
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,840
there is more it says i don't know if

1177
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:21,519
you have an answer for this

1178
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:24,319
but i remember hearing on one episode

1179
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,919
not to mix liquid add-ons with organics

1180
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,678
i'm currently using gaia greens

1181
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,000
all-purpose with dry

1182
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,399
dry amendments i would would i be able

1183
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,038
to use liquid karma without doing any

1184
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,359
harm

1185
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,158
is there even is there any cons to

1186
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,599
mixing

1187
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,080
the two um i think you will be okay

1188
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,558
mixing

1189
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,000
liquid karma in with that organic mix

1190
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,000
the thing to think about when you are

1191
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,038
working with organics and bottled

1192
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,519
nutrients

1193
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,278
is whatever is in that bottle is

1194
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,399
chelated and buffered

1195
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,839
and really concentrated and who knows if

1196
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,398
i don't know if the product you are

1197
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,639
using

1198
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,599
is going to kill off your organic some

1199
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,519
of the buffers

1200
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,959
some of the you're from canada so there

1201
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,519
are chelates in canada

1202
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,000
in uh the states it's shalatian we say

1203
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,120
chile

1204
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,559
chelate i don't know the words are

1205
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,279
different up there i just confused my

1206
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,398
own brain

1207
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,280
but uh worry about the uh the salt

1208
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,598
nutrients

1209
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,679
destroying your mycos if you're using a

1210
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,119
lot of organic stuff those bottled salt

1211
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,918
nutrients can wreak havoc

1212
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,358
on your organics it all depends on what

1213
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,799
products you are using together some

1214
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,519
things will work together some things

1215
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,679
will not

1216
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,119
it is always best though in my opinion

1217
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,398
if you're going to run organics

1218
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,480
stick with organics if you're going to

1219
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,039
use synthetics stick with the synthetics

1220
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,440
because

1221
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,878
there may be you may just be killing off

1222
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,960
one thing by adding the other

1223
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,440
i am not a chemistry expert organic

1224
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,199
chemistry is not my area of expertise

1225
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,280
i am not the organic grower i do the

1226
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,878
bottles and salts so i know that there's

1227
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,440
no problem in my mix

1228
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,279
however liquid karma is a very gentle

1229
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,918
product that is seabird guano that is

1230
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
kelp

1231
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,799
uh there are a couple other things that

1232
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,480
i can't remember in there but they are

1233
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,480
uh they're basically organic

1234
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,880
ingredients and i do not foresee a

1235
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,838
problem by mixing the liquid karma

1236
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,720
in with your gaia products gaia products

1237
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,719
right

1238
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,239
yes gaia greens okay so there should not

1239
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,838
be a problem with that

1240
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,199
um i feel like i've covered you do list

1241
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:14,559

1242
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,319

1347
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,320
a lot of people have taken advantage of

1348
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,960
that grow help tab if you've got a grow

1349
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,800
question

1350
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,720
there are a few questions that i ask you

1351
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,000
on that website like what is the

1352
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,358
temperature of your room what's the

1353
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,960
humidity of your room what are you

1354
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,078
feeding the plants what was the ph of

1355
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,838
your last feed

1356
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,760
the reason i ask you those questions is

1357
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,358
because when you say hey ross to jeff my

1358
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,960
plant turned yellow what's wrong

1359
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,880
i'm going to send you another email that

1360
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,480
asks you all of those questions anyway

1361
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,160
and now i've skipped us both a step

1362
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,000
you've got to tell me the details of

1363
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,358
your room and of your problem before you

1364
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,199
can even send me the question

1365
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:45,119
that makes it easier for both of us so

1366
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,078

1367
