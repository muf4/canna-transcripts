right there

103
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
on the screen all right let's jump into

104
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,439
the main

105
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,759
topic of today's episode

106
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,719
i always say when you grow a plant for

107
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,719
the first time

108
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,639
make sure you take a clone because

109
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,120
sometimes you grow that plant and you

110
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,119
realize

111
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
it is the best [ __ ] you've ever grown

112
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,000
and you really wish you could grow it

113
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
again but you don't have a clone so now

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
it is gone so i always say take a clone

115
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,280
what if you fall in love with that

116
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,479
seedling what if you fall in love with

117
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,560
that plant

118
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,560
plants are seeds are they show variation

119
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
there's phenotypical variation in a

120
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,438
package of seeds

121
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,519
so the chances of getting the exact same

122
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,318
phenotype again from a seed depending on

123
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,480
the breeding

124
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,839
could be rare you may find a gem you may

125
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,759
find a huge outlier

126
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,759
it may be like that was the most potent

127
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,518
or the most medicinal or most relieving

128
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,919
strain i've ever smoked i wish i had

129
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,640
that

130
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,079
you don't have a clone what can we do

131
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,079
you didn't take a clone from it the

132
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,919
clones died the cat ate the clones the

133
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,239
clone dome melted something weird went

134
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,079
on

135
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,758
you roasted the clones we don't have a

136
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,918
clone what is our next

137
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,600
solution you can always take a clone in

138
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,519
flower if you want to do that

139
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,160
if it's too late for that there's one

140
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,000
more option and that is

141
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,360
re-veging that plant i've got a plant

142
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,079
that i didn't think i wanted to run

143
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,160
anymore

144
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,159
so now guess what i am doing it has been

145
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,639
re-veged it is spitting out re-veg

146
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,320
shoots

147
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,319
i'll catch you up with where i am in

148
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,040
that project here in the end of the

149
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:48,560
episode but let's talk about re-veging

150
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,280
our cannabis plants so the purpose is to

151
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,360
uh preserve these genetics to rejuvenate

152
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,959
this plant so we can re-run this plant

153
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,040
and put it back in our arsenal our

154
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,079
stable our library to have this plant

155
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,680
around

156
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,519
unfortunately we've flowered it out we

157
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,959
don't have a clone now we are going to

158
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,279
re-veg so here's how

159
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,159
the reef edge happens the way that i

160
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,719
re-veg

161
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,160
it happens at the end of the flowering

162
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
phase if you were in control of the

163
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,479
flowering phase of this garden

164
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
you are now also in control of a early

165
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,639
re-veg

166
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,919
process during flush time i usually do

167
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,240
this about 10 days

168
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,079
before harvest a lot of times i'm

169
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,079
running an awkward light schedule

170
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,918
at the end of the flowering phase anyway

171
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,639
but i'm going to talk about that very

172
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,120
briefly

173
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,439
i will turn my lights to 18 6 for the

174
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
last 10 or 14 days of flowering

175
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,120
and that will speed up the flowering

176
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,679
process you'll get bigger fatter bulkier

177
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,160
buds

178
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,439
i find it really helps the last last two

179
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
weeks flush time

180
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,120
my lights are on 18 6. i think they're

181
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,559
getting more energy i'm going to cut

182
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,439
them down before they show me any

183
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,519
problems

184
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,038
now if i do not cut them down and i

185
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,120
leave them on that 18-6

186
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,079
light cycle if i let them go for more

187
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,879
than two weeks

188
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,959
i will start to see signs of revenge so

189
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,918
if you're looking to re-veg the plants

190
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,478
about 10 days before harvest about flush

191
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,159
time

192
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:08,719
put that light back on 18-6 or 24 hours

193
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,319
of full light 18.6 will work 24 hours

194
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,479
will work even more quickly

195
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,240
so you got 10 days before harvest time

196
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,839
let's turn the light cycle on 18

197
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
6. then let's flush as usual continue to

198
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,079
flush you

199
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
should just be feeding water to the

200
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,758
plants just nothing but water it's flush

201
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,519
time we're trying to clean out that

202
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
the whole root area get it nice and

203
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,918
clean make those plants taste nice and

204
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,439
good

205
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,359
gonna flush like normal don't add

206
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,639
anything i always say this flushing is

207
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
free just use water

208
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,720
water free right through the plant there

209
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,000
we go flush then we're going to harvest

210
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
these plants but

211
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
we're going to do a little bit different

212
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
uh technique than usual we're going to

213
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
harvest most of the up top parts of the

214
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,519
plants

215
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,360
toward the bottom of the plants we're

216
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,758
going to leave a couple of

217
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
little buds just some size nuggets so

218
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,879
you got the main stock of the branch

219
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,879
main stock of the plant coming up

220
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,199
it branches off a few times you're going

221
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,120
to cut off the main tops those bottoms

222
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,720
the bottom thumb size buds leave four or

223
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,800
five maybe six of those

224
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,319
and those are going to become our new

225
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,360
plant those are going to be the new

226
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,598
shoots that is what is going to re-veg

227
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,120
so now we have harvested and we've left

228
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,120
some excuse me i've got to clear the

229
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,319
throat

230
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,720
all right so we've harvested and we've

231
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,120
left a few little nuggets on the bottom

232
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,840
that are going to be our new vegetative

233
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,918
growth

234
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,679
so those are going to continue to veg

235
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,079
we're going to leave the lights on 18

236
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,759
6 or 24 we've got those little tiny

237
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,918
nuggets there the rest has been removed

238
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,720
it's being harvested dried cured smoked

239
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,959
and enjoyed

240
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
processed just like normal but now we've

241
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,758
got this pot

242
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,879
your three or five gallon seven whatever

243
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,240
size pot you've used

244
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,680
with just this little charlie brown

245
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
christmas tree looking piece of [ __ ]

246
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,598
plant sticking out of it

247
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
it looks really sad but it's been in a

248
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,560
reveg state

249
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,038
it's been being told hey i need you to

250
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,720
reveg for 10 to 14 days by now

251
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,240
and it's already going hey that light's

252
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,680
been on for a long time i'm not sure

253
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
what we need to do here

254
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,639
uh i don't think i'm supposed to flower

255
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
anymore because that's what i do when

256
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,879
it's dark

257
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,879
maybe i'm supposed to do the opposite it

258
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,160
starts thinking maybe i'll go back into

259
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,919
veg you'll start seeing

260
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,599
the tops of the buds will get new little

261
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,478
growth coming out of it new fresh little

262
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,439
growth

263
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,000
eventually that growth will turn into

264
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,560
new

265
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,360
shoots it will start to make new tops

266
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,319
this will happen

267
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,520
slowly over time when i mentioned pot

268
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
sizes a moment ago

269
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,439
i realized i should talk about one more

270
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,319
aspect these plants have been in these

271
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,279
pots

272
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,039
for at least 13 weeks i'm gonna guess

273
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,239
you've got a nine week flowering cycle

274
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,079
you probably had them in there for at

275
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,439
least four weeks and veg in these pots

276
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,079
maybe two if you're really thinking

277
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,759
about it

278
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,599
they've been in there for 11 weeks maybe

279
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,838
12 weeks or longer

280
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
they may need to be uh potted into a

281
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,039
larger pot

282
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,120
if you can carefully and methodically

283
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,199
repot these pots do it if you think you

284
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,519
may cause more harm than good don't do

285
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,759
it

286
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,440
but they're probably root bound opening

287
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,159
up that root zone giving them some room

288
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,839
to grow

289
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,519
will let them know my shoes aren't too

290
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,640
small i can get bigger they will

291
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,120
continue to re-veg

292
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,639
but that's not a major issue if you

293
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
think you're going to [ __ ] the plants up

294
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,360
by

295
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,278
transplanting them don't do more harm

296
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,639
than good they're in there they're small

297
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,559
plants that big root zone is going to

298
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,399
sustain that small plant very well

299
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,599
it'll focus more on the energy up top

300
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,000
but if you can

301
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,759
uh pot it do that but don't don't put

302
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,519
yourself at risk doing it so now

303
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,879
the plant's gonna start making these

304
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,480
little tiny just

305
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,958
nuggety type shoots coming out of the

306
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,959
top for a long time they're gonna look

307
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,359
like [ __ ] they're going to look really

308
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,399
ugly they almost look like dill or some

309
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,159
sort of spice

310
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,919
or something that you'd find floating on

311
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,120
the top of a fancy soup that you're not

312
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,559
supposed to eat it's just there for

313
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,560
flavor and decoration

314
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,359
it doesn't look like cannabis for quite

315
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,319
a while it'll take probably 25

316
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,278
to 45 days depending on the genetics

317
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,040
depending on

318
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,879
the lights depending on the nutrients

319
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,639
depending on the environment

320
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,720
depending on many many things the root

321
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,559
boundness if that's even a word

322
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,879
of that plant a lot of things will

323
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,599
determine how quickly this plant turns

324
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,159
around

325
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,240
uh a lot of it is based on genetics i've

326
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,919
got multiple plants in one room that are

327
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,959
being re-vege and i'm seeing different

328
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,360
behaviors

329
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,879
from these plants so one thing i can

330
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,959
really tell you is that the age

331
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,200
and size of the plant will heavily

332
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,759
affect the way it re-veges somebody gave

333
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,920
me

334
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,278
a bud from a flowering plant they're

335
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,278
like i want you to rescue this

336
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,679
they brought me a bud from a flowering

337
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,159
plant it's really tiny that really tiny

338
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,559
one

339
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,000
reveg much more quickly than a couple of

340
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,879
bigger plants that i pulled out of a

341
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,799
flower room

342
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,159
and thought [ __ ] i don't have a happy

343
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,759
clone of those i want to keep those

344
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,039
don't need to flower them this time

345
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,120
i'm going to pull those out of there i'm

346
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,078
re-veging those i'm also re-vegging one

347
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
that was damn near

348
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,519
finished i'm seeing a lot of different

349
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,799
results from plants that are in

350
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,399
different phases they're

351
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,078
re-veging at different times of course

352
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,679
the smaller ones going quickly

353
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,439
the one that was only into flower for

354
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,479
about two weeks before i decided to pull

355
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,640
it out there's another trick that

356
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,240
happened to that plant i put a plant in

357
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,919
flour for 18 days

358
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
when it produced enough pistols to be

359
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,120
pollinated i pollinated it and then i

360
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,278
put it back in veg

361
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,399
and now i've got that plant re-veging

362
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,320
with seeds in it

363
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,839
and it only took me 18 days to pollinate

364
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,360
that plant and i've got seeds out of

365
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,800
that plant at this point

366
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,759
i pulled a couple of seeds out of it the

367
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,879
other day i'm not going to tell you what

368
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,200
the cross was

369
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,399
but that was my new experiment i va i

370
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,440
vegged it until it was

371
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,559
about probably 18 12 18 inches tall i

372
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,800
put it into flour

373
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,719
it flowered for 18 days i hit it with

374
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,319
pollen as soon as i knew the pollination

375
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
was successful i pulled that plant out

376
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
put it back into a bedroom because i

377
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,319
don't have a clone of it i don't have a

378
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
copy of it

379
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,278
but now i've got that plant back in veg

380
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,480
and it has now crossed to a rise in seed

381
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:29,360
form and those seeds have been pulled

382
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,560
out of that plant

383
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,480
that's some of the weird [ __ ] that i'm

384
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,719
pulling so that plant re-veged

385
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,159
kind of quickly uh not as quickly as the

386
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,680
other one but then the one that is

387
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,919
like nine weeks into flower and i

388
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,639
decided to re-veg that that one took a

389
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,799
really

390
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,480
long time so they reveg at different

391
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,639
stages of different phases based on

392
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,079
where they are

393
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,759
i need to catch up on my notes let me

394
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,000
take a quick glance at the notes here

395
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,439
so they'll start making leaves the

396
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,958
leaves are going to look ugly and funky

397
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,040
eventually those leaves

398
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,319
will more start will start more growth

399
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,439
will start coming out you will start

400
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,120
getting actual

401
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,959
shoots over time those shoots will quit

402
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,320
spinning at first they're going to spin

403
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,838
and they're going to look like claws and

404
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
they're going to look like weird twisty

405
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
leaves

406
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
the plants are going to freak out for a

407
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,319
little bit they're not supposed to do

408
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,000
this

409
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,839
they were not this was not supposed to

410
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
happen if this happened if the plant

411
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,200
survived this long outside it would just

412
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
die and fall apart nature would destroy

413
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
it

414
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,480
it would have hermed out by now it would

415
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
have made a bunch of seeds but

416
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,360
we're not going to don't worry about

417
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,159
that but we're not going to hermit by

418
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
doing this

419
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,319
that's a nature thing so it's going to

420
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,919
freak out it's going to coil up it's

421
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,399
going to spin around eventually those

422
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,159
leaves

423
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
will begin to look like normal leaves

424
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,439
you'll see the difference you'll say hey

425
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,519
there it goes it's starting to do that

426
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,279
the top will come out and it'll peek out

427
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
and those leaves won't look like [ __ ]

428
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,120
you'll go oh it's doing it give it

429
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,959
plenty of time for those shoots to

430
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,278
stretch out you want those to get

431
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,199
i like them about eight inches long with

432
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,519
really good healthy looking leaves at

433
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,480
the top this may take like i said

434
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,839
25 to 45 days i've seen it take 60 days

435
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,200
on some plants so

436
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,800
be very patient get those shoots to come

437
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
out of the plant eventually they will

438
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,759
correct and they'll start looking like

439
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,078
you're growing clones out of the top of

440
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,000
your

441
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,439
buds it'll look you've got those

442
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,360
branches coming up with five little

443
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,079
thumb size nuggets maybe six thumb size

444
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,079
nuggets

445
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,838
out of the top of that is a branch or a

446
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,120
little shoot with perfect leaves it

447
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,200
looks like a little palm tree

448
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,639
a perfect little clone growing out of

449
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
your buds you will see it and you'll be

450
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,959
very proud

451
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,560
that is what you're going to want to

452
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,439
clone that brand new shoot that's

453
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,239
growing out

454
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
take a clone of that i like to wait

455
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,360
until i can see

456
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,720
three or four of those happening and i

457
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,039
will take half of them

458
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,160
and i will clone half of them and when i

459
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,159
take half of them

460
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,360
i'm mostly confident that my clones are

461
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,120
gonna root but

462
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,720
obviously i've got a revenge for some

463
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,240
reason i probably [ __ ] up the clones

464
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,199
the first time or didn't think about it

465
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,639
or something so

466
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,078
i'm gonna clone half of them and i'm

467
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,159
gonna let that plant keep growing and

468
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,078
let the other half keep going

469
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,078
then i've got more backup clones over

470
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,399
there in case [ __ ] happens again

471
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,599
i've got one more backup plan and if you

472
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,879
don't get it that next time then you're

473
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
just [ __ ] out of luck you were not meant

474
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,879
to have that plan

475
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,320
so now i'm going to take the clones i'm

476
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,600
going to grow those clones out

477
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,000
i'm going to let them root i'm going to

478
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,560
let them get big enough to take

479
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,320
to take clones from those i don't want

480
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,719
to flower out these plants

481
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,480
that were re-vege i want to take a clone

482
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,680
off of them i want them to make shoots

483
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,480
and make more clones

484
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,399
i'll take a clone off of that veg it out

485
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,278
let that one be my new flowering plant i

486
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,120
think by then

487
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,039
the genetics and everybody are way back

488
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,360
to normal nobody's in any shock there's

489
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,599
no more stress it forgot all about that

490
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,879
and it's just making plants like before

491
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,639
so it's going to make

492
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,879
funky looking twisted leaves then it'll

493
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,000
make normal shoots we want to clone

494
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,240
those normal shoots take that clone pot

495
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,759
it

496
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,759
let it grow until it is big enough to

497
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,600
take clones take clones

498
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,120
from that one that is now your new donor

499
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,680
plant take clones from that

500
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,759
and flower out those clones that is the

501
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,799
way i think you should do a reveg

502
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,399
i know that is a very simplified method

503
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,198
of re-bet revenge

504
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,919
but i have taught myself keep it simple

505
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:03,919
stoner

506
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,919
too many steps causes too many problems

507
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,719
too many moving parts causes too many

508
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,719
problems

509
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,240
so one of the main keys one of the main

510
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,959
tricks to speeding this up

511
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,759
is to turn the lights back to 18 6

512
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,919
before

513
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,838
you harvest that will really speed this

514
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,278
up if you cannot do that that's okay you

515
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,279
can still re-veg

516
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,639
the day you harvest cut down those

517
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,000
plants clean up the room

518
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,360
get the part you don't need out of there

519
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,759
get the parts you're gonna harvest out

520
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,120
go

521
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,360
trim it up do your thing then

522
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,919
put that plant back on 18-6 put that

523
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,680
room back on 24 hours a day if you can

524
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,519
then get those plants back under a veg

525
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,159
cycle start feeding them

526
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,919
microbes and a good strong veg diet i

527
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,838
like to give them a lot of nitrogen

528
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,439
and a lot of microbes this will get them

529
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,120
going back in a good

530
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,560
vegetative phase so they're going to

531
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,278
start shooting out those shoots

532
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,239
get those clones then just let them let

533
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,078
the clones veg

534
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,759
then take clones of those it is going to

535
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,239
be a long timely

536
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,879
process but it is worth it now here's

537
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
something i

538
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,879
really wanted to talk about in my

539
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,360
experience

540
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,399
i recently re-vegged a plant that was

541
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,159
fully flowered

542
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,120
so i had a plant that was filled with

543
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,480
seeds and i decided to re-veg that plant

544
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
so it is filled with seeds

545
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
it is re-veging and shooting fresh tops

546
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
off of the main top

547
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,159
and a couple of fresh tops off of the

548
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,198
bottom buds there's a couple of freshies

549
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,120
coming up there

550
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,719
what's happening is that top cola is

551
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,320
getting more light so it's going i'll

552
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,759
reveg like a [ __ ] up here where

553
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,600
the light's super super bright

554
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,959
down a little lower it's not getting as

555
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,879
much light uh

556
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,000
it's not re-veging as quickly let me

557
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,159
make another note because there's

558
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
something else i want to touch on that i

559
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,000
didn't even write down

560
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,199
there we go so those are vegging at the

561
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,320
top really heavily

562
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,879
so i went and took a clone from that

563
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,399
main

564
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,078
top piece that was growing out i've got

565
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,958
a few backups down here so if i kill

566
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:50,399
this one up top

567
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,319
i know we got like four or five more

568
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,078
clones down at the bottom so

569
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,519
i topped i chopped that first clone out

570
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,198
of the top put it in the cloner

571
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,639
and waited a few days and i keep

572
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,719
checking for roots every few days

573
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,399
because i've got that grower ocd

574
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,000
and then i keep looking at the plants

575
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,439
where i took the clones from every

576
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,480
day and i'm noticing that since i took

577
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,120
that clone out of that reveged plant

578
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,078
those lower fresh growth tops have

579
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,399
started taking off

580
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,359
i have effectively done the same thing

581
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
that we do

582
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,240
when we top a plant before we flower it

583
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,798
i've taken out its main apical dominant

584
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,640
top

585
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,480
and the plant is going hey guys there's

586
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,360
not a top now somebody else gets to be

587
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,120
the new king

588
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,119
and it's trying to reallocate all those

589
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,519
hormones to the subsequent tops to make

590
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,119
them

591
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,400
the new dominant top but they're all

592
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,839
about the same height in the plant so

593
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,160
they're all growing evenly

594
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,199
and it really sped up the growth of the

595
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,160
clones that i left

596
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,759
behind in that reef edge process so

597
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,360
they're really taking off so

598
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,200
if you're struggling if you can't get a

599
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,519
couple of clones to pop up off of it

600
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,720
as soon as and don't go too early

601
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,839
because that'll [ __ ] you up but as soon

602
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,519
as you got one that's like

603
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,519
eight inches long six or eight inches

604
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,160
long you can get a good solid clone off

605
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,319
of it

606
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,919
take that main top one and then the

607
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,558
others will really start going more

608
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,799
quickly

609
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,720
that's that is what i have noticed so

610
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,918
i've got a clone off of that plant that

611
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,679
is filled with seeds

612
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,679
i'm going to take the main top off of

613
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,360
the plant now put that in a bin and let

614
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,160
it dry so that we can make seeds out of

615
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,240
that

616
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,160
harvest those seeds then i will let the

617
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,839
lower part of that plant continue to veg

618
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,679
and it's re-veging and giving me more

619
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,879
clones i'll take those clones

620
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,038
and then i'll definitely have that

621
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,440
genetics secured i kind of regret

622
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,798
letting that one almost slip away but

623
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,080
now i have secured a freshie clone of

624
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,839
that cross i'm not going to let you guys

625
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,359
know what that is everybody's probably

626
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,798
typing right now what cross was this

627
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,079
what did you do this with and you also

628
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,879
want to know what the one

629
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,519
uh that i veg and then fly a veggie

630
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,520
until it's about

631
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,960
this big then we flowered it out i said

632
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,038
this big and not everybody's watching on

633
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,600
a video it's about 18 inches i think

634
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,038
i've flowered it out at 18 inches i let

635
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,959
it go for 18 days

636
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,480
pollinated that bad [ __ ] let it rest

637
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
for a day in the flower room

638
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,079
then put it back into a veg room and it

639
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,919
reverted to veg

640
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,599
i got a plant with seeds on the bottom

641
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,759
and fresh growth on the top

642
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,279
it was amazing not a lot of people are

643
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,960
going to get to see something like that

644
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,399
in their lifetime all right i do have

645
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,079
one more note that i want to talk about

646
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,440
when it comes to re-veging

647
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,839
i have noticed this is just in my

648
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,279
experience that the plants underneath

649
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,159
the leds

650
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,399
were slower to reveg than the plants

651
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,840
underneath an hps light

652
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,120
but this is a butt the growth

653
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:32,159
that came off of the led lights

654
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:35,359
looked healthier a little bit

655
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,840
sooner they re-veg more quickly and more

656
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,918
heartily under the leds or under the hps

657
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,599
they were like totally let's do this

658
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,600
but they looked a little pale and a

659
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,159
little spindly and a little weird

660
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,119
the ones that under the leds took longer

661
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,240
to show the

662
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:53,119
progress of reveg but once they did it

663
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,599
they looked happier and less stressed

664
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:55,359
out

665
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,199
so that's just another thing that i

666
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,240
observed it happened more quickly under

667
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,038
the hps

668
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,400
but they looked less angry about it

669
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,319
underneath the leds

670
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,720
so that's just in my experience that is

671
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,000
what i saw

672
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,679

673
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,519

674
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,120

675
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,319
i want to apologize for coughing and
