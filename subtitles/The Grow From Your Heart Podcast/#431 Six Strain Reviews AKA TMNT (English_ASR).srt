9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,060
that we start this podcast off by

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,830
talking about what I'm dabbing I think

11
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:28,018
you can still hear my last dab in my

12
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,739
voice it was highly effective and it was

13
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,139
delicious

14
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:33,509
I just took a dab of miracle alien

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,520
cookies full spectrum extract from our

16
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:38,189
friends at Green Dot labs yes that is

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,129
the Mac this concentrate is delicious

18
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:43,349
and it got me high as [ __ ] on the

19
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,628
package it says this is a blend of alien

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,730
cookies and Colombian Starfighter the

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,128
flavor is described as jelly biscuits

22
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,229
and lavender I don't know that I tasted

23
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,390
jelly biscuits but I absolutely did

24
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,968
taste and smell the lavender on the

25
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,189
exhale on the back of the package it

26
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,600
says that this product contains

27
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:02,939
seventy-three point eight eight percent

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,549
THC I've honestly been smoking another

29
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,649
concentrate that says it contains 98%

30
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,110
total cannabinoids and this miracle

31
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,020
alien cookies full spectrum extract

32
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:15,390
immediately put me in another place it

33
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,819
took me somewhere beyond where that 98%

34
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,890
concentrate has been putting me so don't

35
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,228
fall for the hype don't rely too much on

36
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,540
the numbers lab testing is great but it

37
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:26,099
should not be the main deciding factor

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,109
when it comes to choosing your medicine

39
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,688
I've got one concentrate in my hand that

40
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,400
says it contains 98% total cannabinoids

41
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:35,399
and then I've also got this miracle

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,868
alien cookies which says it has 73.8%

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,130
total cannabinoids

44
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:43,319
I would rather dab this 73.8%

45
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:45,899
concentrate over this 98% concentrate

46
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,809
almost anytime I think it tastes better

47
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,000
and I think the buzz is more desirable

48
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,490
so that tells me that it's not all about

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,109
the THC that it is a lot to do with the

50
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,209
other compounds that are in there the

51
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:58,828
terpenes the flavonoids whatever else is

52
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:00,899
in this product that other let's see

53
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,658
we've got 74 percent approximately that

54
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,210
other 26% of stuff is actually making me

55
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,649
enjoy the buzz a little bit better so

56
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,169
big shout out once again to our friends

57
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,050

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,590
I know not to say your name let's get

90
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:20,900
right into it it goes a lot like this

91
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,300

proud to be involved with let's keep

107
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,180
moving this email continues it says I

108
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,730
think you would sell even more seeds if

109
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,400
you made more strain info available I

110
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,379
shop heavily with Duke diamond mainly

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,780
because he has those growing tips on the

112
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,879
package and on seeds here now listings

113
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,000
he has great descriptions and grow notes

114
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,009
and tips hey I love the constructive

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,629
criticism I don't have a lot of details

116
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,060
on my packaging my packaging is very

117
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:21,829
minimalistic I kind of have one generic

118
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,199
package then I put a sticker on it to

119
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,149
identify the strains so my packaging yes

120
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,740
does not contain a lot of info however

121
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:30,228
my website has

122
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,780
overly detailed descriptions of every

123
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:34,728
strain that I have available plus stuff

124
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:37,189
that I released a long time ago and his

125
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:38,418
since been discontinued so on my website

126
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,910
you should be able to find information

127
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:42,409
on every strain available and I put a

128
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,120
lot of the older strains that are

129
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,189
discontinued up there also because they

130
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,110
were used as parents and current crosses

131
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:49,879
so if you see something like what's one

132
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,620
that I did a lot of work on if you see

133
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,360
something like space force you say well

134
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,060
what the heck is space force space

135
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
forces space [ __ ] cross to arise people

136
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,780
may not know what a rise or space

137
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,728
[ __ ] so you can click on space [ __ ]

138
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:04,008
and you can see that space [ __ ] is a

139
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:06,589
space Queen from sub cool pollinated by

140
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,538
my reversed grateful dog that made space

141
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:10,549
[ __ ] then you can also see that a rise

142
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:11,959
is golden go to day breaker and then you

143
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,879
can start breaking down the family tree

144
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,098
that way because a lot of people who are

145
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,959
buying seeds really want to know really

146
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:20,449
detailed lineage of what they are buying

147
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,279
so on my website I do have overly

148
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:24,050
detailed descriptions but I do

149
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,939
appreciate your recommendation and in

150
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,908
the future maybe I will be able to add

151
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,649
more descriptions to my packaging the

152
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:32,509
message goes on and it says I bought

153
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:34,218
your lemon jeffery after listening to

154
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:36,319
that strain review episode because it is

155
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:38,509
cool to hear the breeder give tips and a

156
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,060
little of what to expect well that means

157
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,770
a lot to me I'm glad that you are

158
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,658
appreciated and trusted my review and

159
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:46,430
I'm glad you got some seeds by being

160
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:48,529

161
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,788

162

163
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:53,589
hope it made you completely happy let's

164
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:55,639

00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:57,468
understand that you don't like to toot

166
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,300
your own horn on the show by doing

167
00:05:57,468 --> 00:06:01,459
strain reviews for every offering and

168
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,800
who knows maybe I would get sick of a

169
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:06,079
month of strain reviews but how about an

170
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,750
episode or two where you give a shorter

171
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,968
presentation on each strain perhaps a

172
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,250
quick story a few fee knows to look for

173
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:14,389
a tip or two and then take a dab of it

174
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,490
and describe it to us

175
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,930
hey that is a wonderful idea and you're

176
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,370
right it does feel a little bit weird

177
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,228
sitting here and talking about my

178
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,728
favorite strains the strains that I've

179
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:24,740
created the strains that I've made

180
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:26,269
available it feels egotistical and it

181
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,430
feels kind of weird doing it but so many

182
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:30,139
people ask for it that I do feel like it

183
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,879
is time to put out a few more strain

184
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,650
episodes so look forward to those in

185
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,300
fact in this episode we are going to

186
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:37,098
jump into some strain descriptions

187
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,569
pretty soon here there's more to this

188
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:40,370
email and it goes like this you hit a

189
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,540
bunch of strains dished out a ton of

190
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,100
info on the dude

191
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,590
Grolsch oh and that was with Scottie

192
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,270
taking up time too I think a couple of

193
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:49,429
episodes would be enough to really push

194
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:51,319
your seed sales through the roof and

195
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,660
help all those customers get what they

196
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,370
are really looking for hey Thank You Man

appreciate that people don't know where

212
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,730
they can improve where they're making

213
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:27,829

216
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,879
doing a little better strain

217
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,959
descriptions on my packaging and having

218
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,579
a little bit better of a strain

219
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,829
description on the vendor website so

220
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,839
that maybe I may sell a few more seed

221
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:41,060
packages which would always be nice for

222
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,799
myself as a seed seller and always nice

223
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,600
for the people on the other end who are

224
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,310
getting seeds that they need so thank

225
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,230
you for the great advice I will take

226
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,750
that to heart in fact we are going to

227
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,670
use some of your advice on this episode

228
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,750
let's get right into the next email

229
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:58,340
because it goes a lot like this hey I'm

230
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,199
in prohibition land so please don't say

231
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:02,479
my name I just wanted to say that your

232
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,029
podcast has helped me immensely in my

233
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,700
growing efforts I work nine hours a day

234
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:10,129
as a janitor basically sweeping floors

235
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,250
and being bored all day and your podcast

236
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:14,930
helps so much to pass the time a man I'm

237
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,000
glad I'm making your day go by that has

238
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,680
got to get tedious just sweeping floors

239
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,449
I'm glad I'm there to entertain you at

240
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,050
least one or two days a week thanks for

241
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,069
listening

242
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,350
feels like we've got a great

243
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:26,629
relationship already he goes on to say I

244
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,310
love the show lessons or I love the grow

245
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:30,350
lessons and I also love the episodes

246
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,790
with white Mike hey white Mike you got a

247
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,190
shout-out bro it's time to come to

248
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:36,200
another episode he goes on to say I just

249
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,970
finished my first grow and I was

250
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,710
honestly feeling a little discouraged

251
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,840
and I had thoughts of giving up growing

252
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,000
because I did not get the yield I had

253
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,670
wanted but then I heard you talk on one

254
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,500
of the grow lessons about how to not be

255
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:50,120
discouraged by your first grow and to

256
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,600
instead use it as a learning opportunity

257
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,459
and that advice has stuck with me yeah

258
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,528
you can't give up on the first try of

259
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:01,018
anything remember the first time you

260
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:02,939
played Mario Kart you sucked it was

261
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,709
embarrassing it was no fun you couldn't

262
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,790
keep that damn car on the track you

263
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,198
couldn't go around the corners right

264
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:09,439
somebody threw a banana at you any

265
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:12,838
[ __ ] spun out you were angry but now

266
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,339
everybody kicks ass at Mario Kart so you

267
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,290
can't expect to be really good at

268
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,360
anything the first time you try it I was

269
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,919
a terrible drummer the first time I got

270
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,350
sticks people wanted to beat me to death

271
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,629
with my drumsticks now I can hold the

272
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,759
fat groove all day long don't feel

273
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:28,828
discouraged if you are not a pro at

274
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,778
something the very first time don't

275
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:33,179
expect to be a pro at growing the very

276
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:35,068
first time if you have a successful crop

277
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:37,620
that you can smoke out of your first

278
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:40,349
grow that is success and like this guy

279
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,839
says use it as a learning experience now

280
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,699
you've got a baseline to start from if

281
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,500
your next grow is worse you should

282
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:48,448
reconsider [ __ ] if your next girl is

283
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,549
better you were on the path you need to

284
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:53,099
be on so don't ever get discouraged from

285
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,539
anything you fail at the first time that

286
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,069
is a learning lesson you need to fail

287
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,480
the first time because if you're

288
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:59,789
successful if you're hugely successful

289
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,470
at anything the first time it gets to

290
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:03,689
your ego and you start teaching yourself

291
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,819
bad habits because you already know

292
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,490
everything so you got to [ __ ] up you got

293
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:10,289
to be humbled then you can improve so

294
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,948
let's continue with this email it says I

295
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:15,240
am now on my second grow and I'm growing

296
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:18,059
Michelangelo from I read genetics and a

297
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,579
five gallon pot with Fox Farms ocean

298
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,409
forest soil and I'm using a

299
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:25,799
horticultural lighting group 100 grow

300
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:27,480
light with a 2x2 grow tent he says I

301
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,759
live in a one-room cabin without much

302
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,740
space but I am feeling more confident

303
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,970
about this grow thanks to the help of

304
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,278
your podcast

305
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,139
he goes on to say if you have any tips

306
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,088
for that strain it would be awesome to

307
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:40,829
hear them I'm sorry for the rambling

308
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,810
email but I wanted to let you know that

309
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:46,318
your show is amazing and tell you to

310
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:48,539

311
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:50,458
great email thank you so this guy

312
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,110
started off disappointed in his first

313
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,239
grow but listening to the podcast

314
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,829
encouraged him to give it a second try

315
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,448
so I'm proud of you for going in for a

316
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:58,979
second try even though the first time

317
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:01,438
kind of disappointed you

318
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,778
this time he has got a great setup he's

319
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:06,328
got some Michelangelo seeds that is a

320
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:07,710
platinum tangi pollinated by a reversed

321
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:09,359
blueberry cookies

322
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,950
so he's got some feminized seeds that

323
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,839
are very reliable I know what they were

324
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,778
gonna do these are going to be great in

325
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,910
that grow he's got a five gallon fabric

326
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:19,620
pot with Fox farms ocean forest soil

327
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:21,629
that is going to be great for this grow

328
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,149
he's using the appropriate light he's

329
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:25,830
got an HL G 100 and his two by two ten

330
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,169
so that is going to be perfect he's

331
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,209
probably got one five gallon pot under

332
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:32,189
this light in a two by two tent this

333
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:35,009
should provide perfect medicine for one

334
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,500
person now he says if you have any tips

335
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:39,870
for the Michelangelo it would be awesome

336
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,549
to hear them now this is the point in

337
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,649
the episode where that first email

338
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:45,689
talking about strain descriptions and

339
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,669
strain review episodes is going to

340
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,350
collide with this email where our new

341
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:52,110
friend is asking for advice and guidance

342
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,139
on the strain Michelangelo now let's

343
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,300
shift podcast gears and do a few strain

344
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,278
reviews I'm not going to start with the

345
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,708
Michelangelo today I want to start with

346
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,659
the strain that I call Leonardo Leonardo

347
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:06,179
is a very important strain to me

348
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:08,278
leonardo was made from a reversed

349
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:10,769
blueberry cookies plant which is a

350
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,870
platinum cookies cross to the blueberry

351
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,579
tahoe so you can already imagine the

352
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,919
smells and aromas coming from there I

353
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,629
had the blueberry cookies plant and I

354
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,269
reversed it which means I treated it

355
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:24,360
with a solution that solution made that

356
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:26,699
plant produce pollen sacks those pollen

357
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,000
sacks produced pollen that only contain

358
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,950
female chromosomes I have done complete

359
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,899
episodes on reversing plants I have done

360
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,850
full episodes on selfed and reversed

361
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,399
plants if you want more information on

362
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,320
that check out episode number 330 one

363
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,449
called selfing and reversals I go into

364
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,220
deep detail there today we're going to

365
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,839
focus on these few strains because I can

366
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,910
tell that this episode is going to get

367
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,860
quite long so I took the blueberry

368
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:52,379
cookies and I selfed it so that is a

369
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,149
blueberry cookies s 1 that is the

370
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:57,088
Leonardo let's talk briefly about

371
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:59,370
Leonardo Leonardo is the blueberry

372
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,020
cookies s1 being self that means it

373
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,179
doesn't have a lot of opportunity for

374
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,309
Fino typical variation you're going to

375
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:07,469
find very common phenotypes in there

376
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:10,500
blueberry cookies will grow tall and

377
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,000
fast in veg coming from the Tahoe og

378
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,919
parents and the Girl Scout cookies

379
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,679
parents she likes to get kind of tall

380
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:20,099
she will make long branches she also

381
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,299
makes giant colas most of the crosses

382
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,250
that came from the blueberry

383
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:24,838
cookies really take off in height but

384
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,480
they make up for it because they make

385
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,640
gigantic top colas so be prepared for

386
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,830
taller plants maybe flour just a little

387
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,319
bit early expect your plants to double

388
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,910
in size from the time you flip them to

389
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,070
the end of flour so the blueberry

390
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:41,100
cookies will get tall and it makes tall

391
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,110
offspring but they make gigantic buds so

392
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,659
it is worth it you will get heavy

393
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,730
harvests from almost all of the

394
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:50,129
blueberry cookies crosses almost every

395
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,350
phenotype will give you big fat harvests

396
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,929
so Leonardo is going to get kind of tall

397
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,420
and make gigantic buds I like to give

398
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:59,399
Leo about eight and a half to ten weeks

399
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,379
to finish it depends on your environment

400
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,450
it depends on your room it depends on

401
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:05,490
your feeding somewhere between eight and

402
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,050
a half to ten weeks will be perfect for

403
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,899
this plant somewhere between sixty and

404
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:12,599
seventy days everything that comes from

405
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:15,149
the Leonardo crosses can be fed very

406
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,579
heavily and they also like to drink a

407
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:19,589
lot I've noticed that most of them love

408
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:21,269
to suck up more water than the average

409
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,829
plant so don't be afraid to feed them

410
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:25,560
heavily and you're gonna have to water

411
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:27,479
them frequently so be on top of that now

412
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,699
all of the crosses that come from the

413
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,800
Leonardo the reversed blueberry cookies

414
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,990
they are all huge producers they make

415
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,969
gigantic buds they all make tremendous

416
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,528
resin production they are all super

417
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,060
potent they're all going to take

418
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:40,889
somewhere between eight and a half to

419
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:43,199
ten weeks to finish the thing that is

420
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,509
really going to make these crosses stand

421
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,300
out is all of the unique flavors and

422
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,370
aromas I used very carefully selected

423
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:53,039
females for these crosses and my goal

424
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,899
was to make ridiculous candy Terps and I

425
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,759
feel like I nailed that goal so let's

426
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,009
talk about the flavors and aromas from

427
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,958
the blueberry cookies the dominant smell

428
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:03,899
of course is the blueberry but it also

429
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,269
has a funk to it it is almost like blue

430
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:08,698
nerds or some sort of blue candy maybe

431
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:10,230
blue skittles it kind of reminds me of

432
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,208
when I was younger and I used to buy

433
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,560
those blue raspberry lollipops and I

434
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,838
would suck on those and it would turn my

435
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,328
whole face blue it kind of reminds me of

436
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,980
those kind of suckers with a Wang to it

437
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:22,169
it's got something sharper something

438
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,720
funky to it it's like blue nerds and

439
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:26,639
skittles with dirty feet in the bag or

440
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,889
something it is really enjoyable and I

441
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,689
really love that funky everybody that

442
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:32,338
smells it really loves that aroma that

443
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,710
is part of what inspired me to work with

444
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,750
this a very well-known grower

445
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,700
and breeder smokes some of the finished

446
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,169
product and when he smoked it he said

447
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,390
man this is amazing

448
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:44,159
are there any seeds available and I said

449
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:46,049
there aren't any seeds available and he

450
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,579
said can somebody reverse this and make

451
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:49,559
some seeds so that I could take this

452
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,540
back to her I live and grow it there and

453
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,609
everybody kind of looked at me and it

454
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:55,980
became my job to reverse the blueberry

455
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,750
cookies and make seeds of it for this

456
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,060
friend of ours who's a highly respected

457
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,580
member of the cannabis community I was

458
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,039
honored to accept that job but when I do

459
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,290
something like that I don't just make

460
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,480
one cross I had to think about it and I

461
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:11,399
chose a few of my favorite females to

462
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,649
put in the room along with the blueberry

463
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,899
cookies to pollinate them also and I

464
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,490
feel like I made very wise choices on

465
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,350
the girls that I selected but let's keep

466
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,549
focusing on the blueberry cookies for a

467
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,310
moment we're still talking about the

468
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:25,169
flavors here it is unique it is crazy it

469
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:27,479
is like blue raspberries and it is like

470
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:28,979
blue skittles and the flavor just hangs

471
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,420
out in your mouth for a long time you'll

472
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,129
have tremendous cottonmouth you'd be

473
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,299
like I really need a drink but you won't

474
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:35,220
want to drink anything because that

475
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:37,889
cottonmouth flavor from the blueberry

476
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,840
cookies is just so delicious so a lot of

477
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,210
the crosses are going to be dominated by

478
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,670
that blueberry cookies blue raspberry

479
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,490
funky chirp so keep that in mind as we

480
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:48,990
talk about all of the next crosses the

481
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,580
next cross I want to talk about that was

482
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,210
made from that reversed blueberry

483
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,830
cookies is a strain I call Donatello

484
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,600
Donatello was made by the reversed

485
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,210
blueberry cookies pollinating my

486
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,100
favorite lemon skunk female I talked

487
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,380
about that lemon skunk female a lot that

488
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,750
is the mother of the lemon Jeffrey she

489
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,730
is also the mother of Firefly that lemon

490
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,259
skunk has made a lot of great progeny

491
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,329
I've been working with her for several

492
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,940
years because I love that plant it

493
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:17,519
smells amazing it is gorgeous it puts

494
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,950
off beautiful colors beautiful bright

495
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,109
bright light green colors with beautiful

496
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:24,480
orange pistils it is such a gorgeous

497
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:26,369
plant it smells like lemon candy and

498
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,380
sort of a lemon sorbet sort of a thing

499
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:30,449
I've never smelled anything like it it

500
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,160
came from seed so I'm the only one that

501
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,200
has got that phenotype as far as I've

502
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,090
ever seen I think it's an amazing plant

503
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,559
I loved working with that lemon skunk I

504
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,419
loved it because of the aromas the

505
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,309
structure everything about it is

506
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,190
beautiful when I crossed it to the

507
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:46,649
blueberry cookies it put a lemon lime

508
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,120
blueberry sort of a Wang to it it is

509
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,040
really amazing it's

510
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,779
sort of like a key lime pie with

511
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,089
blueberries in the middle or a blue

512
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,799
raspberry key lime kind of a pie sort of

513
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,480
a thing going on I really like the

514
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,849
aromas and flavors of that one

515
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,700
Donatello does grow tall because of that

516
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:04,769
lemon skunk but it's got big thick fat

517
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,390
branches so it can get tall and it can

518
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:07,950
handle being cracked it can handle being

519
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,559
bent it can handle being worked into a

520
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,330
net it likes that sort of a stuff again

521
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,339
I think it should go about eight to ten

522
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:16,470
weeks for best results it is going to

523
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,849
vary depending on your environment based

524
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,529
on your humidity your temperature and

525
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:21,359
your nutrients a lot of things will

526
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,859
determine the factor of how long it

527
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,079
takes for these plants to finish in your

528
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:27,779
room but somewhere between 60 and 70

529
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,730
days should be perfect one thing I

530
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,079
should note about the Donatello most of

531
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,240
these strains I'm talking about get

532
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,279
quite tall Donatello is one of the more

533
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,839
branchy strains it will widen out it

534
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,700
wants a little bit more space than the

535
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:40,709
rest of its sisters in this line it

536
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,240
wants to spread its arms just a little

537
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,400
bit more and it does get a little bit

538
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,650
branch here so you may need to be

539
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,300
prepared with Stakes tomato cages or

540
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,250
some sort of scrog net because she may

541
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,200
need some training she's gonna try to

542
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,940
widen out on you also she will need some

543
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,679
supports later in Flour because those

544
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,140
long branches will need some support

545
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,970
again all of these strains love it when

546
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,380
you put them in a scrub they love it

547
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,549
when you crack them when you super crop

548
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,470
them when you twist them when you pop

549
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,940
them they like being topped all of these

550
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,460
plants can take pretty good abuse

551
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,690
because of the parents I selected now

552
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,460
let's talk about the strain that

553
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,160
inspired this episode let's talk about

554
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,590
Michelangelo Michelangelo is made from a

555
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,420
platinum tangi female that was of course

556
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,939
pollinated by that blueberry cookies

557
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,279
male the platinum tangi has its own

558
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,070
crazy unique aromas it is like dirty

559
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,079
greasy oranges it's like candy oranges

560
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:29,700
that you've got at the motor-oil shop or

561
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,949
something like that it is delicious and

562
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,960
funky I tend to like those really fruity

563
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,069
flavors with something nasty on top of

564
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,140
it it just seems to be one of my

565
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:39,178
favorite sort of varieties to find it's

566
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,830
something with a real familiar citrusy

567
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,840
fruit thing and then just dirty it up

568
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:44,699
with some funk I really like that what

569
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,250
I've noticed in most of the Michelangelo

570
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,190
seeds is that it is dominantly oranges

571
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,619
it comes out as just sweet gross oranges

572
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:56,000
almost orange rinds almost overpowering

573
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:58,469
orange cleaner oranges sometimes have a

574
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,450
overpowering a stringent aroma when you

575
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,380
get too close to the rind and I think

576
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,029
sometimes the mic

577
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,940
Angelou can carry bat and some of the

578
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:07,410
phenotypes it is overpoweringly orange

579
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,210
and it is amazing if you want to make

580
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,580
concentrates that taste like straight-up

581
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,769
tangerines and oranges Michelangelo is

582
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,629
the way to go for you our friend stabby

583
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:18,930
mixed adversan gruesome Michelangelo

584
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,820
that the jar still smells like oranges

585
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,980
and tangerines and it's been empty for

586
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:25,589
over a month now so the flavors from

587
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,269
Michelangelo is dominantly oranges with

588
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:29,069
a little bit of that skittle e funk on

589
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,589
top of it that candy funk sweetness

590
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:32,970
which I really enjoy Michelangelo is

591
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:34,289
another one that will branch out a

592
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,089
little bit for you coming from that

593
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:37,769
platinum tangi that one doesn't get

594
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:40,500
super tall it's kind of a short squat

595
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,849
plant that makes the Michelangelo do

596
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,470
kind of the same thing she stays a

597
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:45,059
little shorter than the rest don't get

598
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,799
me wrong she will get tall on you she'll

599
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,809
make big plants but she has a little

600
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,909
branch here she widens out a little bit

601
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:52,980
more but she makes really thick stalks

602
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,440
so she can support herself a little

603
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,599
better than the Donatello again like all

604
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,700
of these crosses Michelangelo will love

605
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,679
being scrubbed she'll love being trained

606
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,410
she'll love being topped these plants

607
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,000
can all take quite a bit of abuse

608
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,160
another thing I should note Michelangelo

609
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,960
may be the earliest finisher out of this

610
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,180
bunch I keep saying that some of them

611
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,990
should take 60 to 70 days Mikey may

612
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,910
finish as early as 56 or 55 days don't

613
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,319
be in a rush let it finish if it wants

614
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,980
to go longer let it but some of the

615
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,379
phenotypes

616
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,329
coming from that platinum tangi cross do

617
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,550
make it finish a little bit earlier so

618
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:28,619
that is Michelangelo let's talk next

619
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:30,569
about Raphael I'm sure by now you have

620
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:32,519
found the trend and the theme and these

621
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:34,589
strains that I made you can see where

622
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,529
these names came from let's talk about

623
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:39,720
Raphael Raphael is the Strawberry Fields

624
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:42,000
from Crockett farms pollinated by the

625
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,920
reversed blueberry cookies that

626
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,109
Strawberry Fields plant is great to grow

627
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,900
it makes giant colas and that definitely

628
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:51,539
came through in the cross raphael likes

629
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,900
to make giant huge top colas that are

630
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,579
just coated in trichomes and they smell

631
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,710
ridiculous it is like strawberries and

632
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:00,359
tangerines and there's a little bit of a

633
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,100
grapefruit thing going on in there and

634
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,629
then you get that blueberry skittles

635
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:05,579
that kind of backs it up it is really

636
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,790
hard to describe because it is just so

637
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:11,970
funky it's tropical its strawberries its

638
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:13,259
mangos its pineapples its bananas it's

639
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,970
got a little bit of all that tropical

640
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:16,890
fruit Plus that we

641
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,410
funk that I like it is really delicious

642
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,940
it almost tastes like in my opinion and

643
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,740
people think I'm crazy sometimes with my

644
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,779
strain descriptions but a lot of people

645
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,599
love it a lot of times when I smoke a

646
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,759
DAB my mouth gets really dry I feel like

647
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,429
when I smoked the Raphael my mouth gets

648
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,440
juicy it tastes like I just ate juicy

649
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,820
candy or juicy fruit and my mouth is

650
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,009
actually moist from it so I'm not

651
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:40,019
thirsty when I smoked the Raphael

652
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:41,910
concentrates and one thing I should add

653
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:43,769
to that is Raphael makes great

654
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,080
concentrates and it makes a lot of

655
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:48,240
concentrates everybody that presses it

656
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,859
that washes it that extracts it in any

657
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,079
way they always report back that they

658
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,819
got impressive returns and then later on

659
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,599
they always report that it tasted

660
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:57,179
amazing

661
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,519
so Raphael is great for concentrates it

662
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,740
is also great for production if you need

663
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,200
something with fat harvest and good bag

664
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,269
appeal and unique aromas Raphael is

665
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,620
perfect for you I've got two more

666
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:09,539
strains I want to talk about here in

667
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,549
this strain review episode the next one

668
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:14,909
I want to talk about is called bebop

669
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:17,490
bebop is my prized arise number four

670
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:20,040
female pollinated by the reversed

671
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,799
blueberry cookies so those are two of my

672
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:25,379
best tasting favorite to grow favorite

673
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,480
to smoke best lab testing easiest to

674
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,850
work with strains and I cross them and

675
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,610
the results were almost exactly what I

676
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:34,919
expected I turbocharged the good traits

677
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:37,619
from both of those plants I basically

678
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,140
made bigger badder blueberry cookies

679
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:43,109
with more potency and more trichomes and

680
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,520
it seems to grow with more vigor bebop

681
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:46,619
does tend to get a little bit tall

682
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,869
that's because it has got the Joseph og

683
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,129
the Kim D the Tahoe and the cookies all

684
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:52,709
in there that is going to result in

685
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,680
taller plants also this is one of the

686
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,779
longer finishing crosses in this line I

687
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,070
keep saying that most of these plants

688
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:00,750
are going to take about eight to ten

689
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:02,759
weeks I really recommend that you let

690
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,680
this one go closer to ten weeks if

691
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:06,480
you've got the opportunity in that last

692
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,549
week it's going to add potency and it is

693
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,319
going to give itself just another week

694
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,819
to just bulk up so it'll get even bigger

695
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,679
and fatter on you and it'll be well

696
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:15,990
worth that extra week if you can let it

697
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,759
go that full seventy days so bee bop

698
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,670
does get kind of tall she does take a

699
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,140
little bit longer to finish but she is

700
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:24,300
ridiculously potent arises one of my

701
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,980
highest lab testing strains the

702
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,210
blueberry cookies always test really

703
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,779
high in the lab when we grow it in a

704
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,519
commercial facility so when I

705
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:32,950
those I knew that the potency would be

706
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,440
off the charts the trichome development

707
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,990
on these plants will be ridiculous the

708
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,309
flavors and aromas are crazy it is kind

709
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,200
of the blueberry cookies really

710
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:43,450
dominates the flavor you get that blue

711
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,430
skittles blueberry cookies blue

712
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:48,250
raspberry sort of a flavor but then it's

713
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,779
got a wonderful disgusting skunky og

714
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,759
cushioning in the back end of it that

715
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,680
you don't notice until you exhale you

716
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,269
inhale and it's straight-up candy and

717
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,670
deliciousness and then you blow it out

718
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:59,170
and you're like oh that is dank it's two

719
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,750
different flavors in your mouth it is

720
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,220
really amazing so that is the be-bop the

721
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,500
main thing about her is that she is the

722
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,019
longest flowering one out of the line

723
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,630
and she's going to get tall but she

724
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:12,519
makes up for it with amazing potency and

725
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,070
tremendous flavor so if you've got the

726
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,230
space the height and the patience bebop

727
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:18,339
is a great one for you the last one in

728
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,440
this line that we were going to talk

729
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:23,079
about is what is left the one called

730
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,660
rock steady rock steady is a Durban

731
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,179
poison female pollinated by the reversed

732
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,040
blueberry cookies this one is one of my

733
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,120
favorites it is also a huge

734
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:34,329
crowd-pleaser

735
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:37,719
rock steady grows ridiculously fast and

736
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:39,189
makes ridiculously giant buds rock

737
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,230
steady is going to get tall like the

738
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,490
rest of these plants she will finish in

739
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,740
that eight to ten week time frame

740
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,079
something to think about with Rocksteady

741
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,269
is it does not like as much water as the

742
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,579
rest of these crosses coming from that

743
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:53,259
Durban poison female it wants a little

744
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,519
bit less water than the rest of the

745
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:57,940
plant so pay attention

746
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,799
also it likes to widen out real far you

747
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,120
will get a real Big Top Cola but then

748
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:02,649
you'll get some branches that want to

749
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,289
kind of stretch out and make some space

750
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:07,810
she is going to need cages or supports

751
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:09,279
or she works wonderfully in a screen of

752
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,470
green system she kind of programs

753
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,149
herself automatically to reach out she's

754
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,640
beautiful in a screen of green you can

755
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,380
really Weaver in their super nicely now

756
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,450
the flavors that come off of Rocksteady

757
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,280
are hard to describe of course it's got

758
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,259
that blueberry cookies flavor it's got

759
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,299
that blue raspberry thing going on to it

760
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:27,190
but then you put that Durban poison I

761
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,139
think Durban poison has a hint of mint

762
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,820
in the background of the aroma and then

763
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,980
everybody describes that other flavor as

764
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:35,740
anise oil which I'm not sure of it I've

765
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,390
ever smelled real anise but it's got

766
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,950
that Durban poison sort of a peppery

767
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,990
sort of a thing sort of a mint thing

768
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,090
going on with that blueberry cookies

769
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,490
thing and it also creates soar

770
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:46,959
of a raspberry kind of aroma I really

771
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,940
don't know where the raspberry comes

772
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,190
from but many of the phenotypes have a

773
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,590
raspberry aroma and flavor coming off of

774
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,210
them and I really enjoy it maybe some of

775
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:56,559
that flavor is blackberries as well it's

776
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,420
got that sort of a tart thing that a

777
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,190
fresh berries got but it also has that

778
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,870
fruity thing so it's really it's really

779
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,529
complex it's really unique it's kind of

780
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:04,209
hard to describe

781
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:06,190
other than that blue raspberry flavor

782
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,350
with that perfect Durban poison

783
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,940
combination to it it is exactly what you

784
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:12,309
thought it would taste like if you cross

785
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,559
those two together so I think that is

786
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:17,769
enough on the breakdown of leonardo

787
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,049
Donatello Michelangelo Raphael bebop and

788
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:22,269
rocksteady just to wrap it up all of

789
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:23,589
them are going to grow fairly tall the

790
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:26,139
ones that are going to push out a little

791
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:29,349
bit more for you are the Michelangelo

792
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,390
and the bebop the Rocksteady is going to

793
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:33,219
grow a little more sideways it's not

794
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:36,009
going to exactly push out it branches

795
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,509
out and those branches need supports it

796
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:39,730
kind of looks like most of the Durban

797
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:41,410
poison crosses want to stay lower to the

798
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,690
ground and push out a little bit and

799
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,220
then produce one big top so if we train

800
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,900
them if we give them some supports they

801
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,579
really work well they lift themselves up

802
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,290
and they work beautifully I love that

803
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:51,849
flavor and aroma and the potency can't

804
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:53,409
be beat so I'm going to keep working

805
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:55,480
with the Durban poison that is an

806
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:57,040
excellent strain Rocksteady may need a

807
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,509
little extra attention out of all of

808
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,579
those but if you're running a screen of

809
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:02,710
green that is the ideal strain for you

810
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:05,230
all of these strains are going to

811
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:07,630
produce crazy ridiculous candy

812
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:10,299
out-of-control fruity turps you're going

813
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:12,280
to need some sort of odor control and to

814
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:14,740
wrap it all up most of them are going to

815
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:17,049
finish in about eight to ten weeks of

816
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:19,000
course that is phenotype dependent that

817
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:21,279
is environment dependent that could be

818
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,190
nutrient light humidity dependent but

819
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,259
most of them will take about 56 to 70

820
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,480
days to be finished now I didn't go too

821
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:30,910
deep into specific phenotypes to look

822
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,490
for within each strain most of the time

823
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,800
honestly it is going to be about a 50/50

824
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,970
mix of each parent you're going to find

825
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,319
things that look a lot like the

826
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,850
blueberry cookies and then you're going

827
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,589
to find things that look a lot like the

828
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:43,419
female I crossed it too and then you'll

829
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:46,000
find things that kind of dominate or are

830
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,039
50/50 mixes you're going to find very

831
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,920
close representations to both parents

832
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:53,710
and beautiful combinations in every pack

833
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,690
so that is a quick breakdown on six of

834
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:59,210
