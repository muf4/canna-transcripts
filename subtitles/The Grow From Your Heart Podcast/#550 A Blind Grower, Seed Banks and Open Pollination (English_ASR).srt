marijuana for the majority of my life

365
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,679
uh 25 years now and i remember what

366
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,639
mature plants look like but i never had

367
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,239
any valuable

368
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,159
hands-on experience while i could see

369
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,000
now i'm trying to teach myself to grow

370
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,799
blind and i'm using the resources you

371
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,839
suggested

372
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,439

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,120
there are things that i'm running into

374
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,880
though and i don't really know how to

375
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,519
handle them

376
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,000
wow this guy got further than i ever

377
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,639
think i

378
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,519
would if i were blind and trying to grow

379
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,439
this guy

380
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,959
has made success he's gotten somewhere

381
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,240
that's way further than i feel like i

382
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,518
could have gotten i'm proud of this guy

383
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
i'm impressed

384
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,720

388
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,838

00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,439

436
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,919
bit of coaching to figure things out i'm

437
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,959
trying

438
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,000
so i spent like a day you kind of sprang

439
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,799
this one on me i'm trying

440
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,120
to wrap my head around it and that's a

441
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,120
big

442
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,360
question mark right now like there's so

443
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,719
many different things where my brain's

444
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,720
like well how are we gonna do this

445
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,399
yeah i as he as

446
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,800
the as a person who is often in charge

447
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,919
of large commercial cultivations

448
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:32,958
my main job is to oversee

449
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,879
[ __ ] ninety percent of what i'm doing is

450
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,319
seeing what's going on i just walk

451
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,120
around and look at [ __ ]

452
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,639
like is this room where it needs to be

453
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,159
are the temperatures i guess i feel that

454
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,120
part but i look at meters

455
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,639
uh do the plants look good does the

456
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,480
equipment say what it needs to say are

457
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,120
the lights doing within i go to another

458
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,720
room and then i

459
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,078
and i look at the crew are the guys

460
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,440
doing within the gals are they doing

461
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,120
what they need to do is mike doing what

462
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,839
he needs to do are the computers working

463
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,039
properly

464
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,320
because you guys are running computers

465
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,559
in part of the building are the trimmers

466
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,000
do i'm visually doing 90

467
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,439
of my job uh so yeah

468
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,278
the reason i wanted to read this is

469
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,399
because i had very

470
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,480
minimal useful advice i have never

471
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,600
i don't have any experience being blind

472
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,519
more about the

473
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,040
the growth set up before i could even

474
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,919
let's keep going let's keep going it

475
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,319
says we are currently

476
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,919
uh curing some lemon jeffrey i did not

477
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,399
really participate in the grow i was

478
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,759
just a cheerleader and a smell tester

479
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,839
so it sounds like the wife has probably

480
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,439
got a decent grasp on growing uh thanks

481
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,079

482
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
you i understand

483
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,000
you're a busy man and you already have a

484
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,600
full plate thanks again and keep it up

485
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,360

487
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,759

488

489
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,480
um so i don't have any like i said any

490
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,439
useful advice i don't i didn't ask a lot

491
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,039
of questions about

492
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,519
what kind of products you're using what

493
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,599
your setup is uh that that was more

494
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,240
technical than i was even ready to get

495
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,800
i thought there may be other blind

496
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,120
people

497
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,120
other blind growers other growers who

498
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,399
are losing their sight and slowly lost

499
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,560
their sight over time that have learned

500
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,159
how to adapt and adjust

501
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,838
yeah so i'm hoping they're listening

502
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,719
that's the other odds we've got to have

503
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,959
them listening

504
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
also so hopefully they're listening then

505
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,439
also hopefully

506
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,679
they're able to reach out to us and

507
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,440
reach us my email address

508
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:21,198
is grow from your heart at hotmail.com

509
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,120
if you send me an email and tell me that

510
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,759
you've got advice and ways to help out a

511
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,360
blind

512
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,198
grower or somebody who is losing their

513
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,639
sight i would love some advice to help

514
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,838
our new friend because this is a great

515
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,278
story

516
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,399
and big props to the wife but i

517
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,838
understand that you want to be

518
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,720
self-sufficient and do it yourself

519
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
that's really cool

520
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,879
and i want to see you do that but i've

521
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,639
never been blind so i don't have any

522
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,240
good advice for that it's

523
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,680
everything if you put if you blindfolded

524
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,278
me and put me in the grow room

525
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,719
i would hurt myself like there's so many

526
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,120
things in there that i'm just afraid of

527
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
without

528
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,000
sight and well it's

529
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,239
neither of us have had to operate

530
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,360
without it so we're both so heavily

531
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,240
reliant on it i'm just

532
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,278
like i'm thinking about a couple of

533
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,680
different

534
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,958
like nutrient stations that we've

535
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,359
managed

536
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,319
um and some of the different caustic

537
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,959
cleaner

538
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,839
agents or so we did talk a couple of

539
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,599
times

540
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,279
and he said that his biggest issues are

541
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,320
mixing and sexing so you're right the

542
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,240
nutrient station

543
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,079
like all the bottles look the same you'd

544
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,120
have to get different shaped bottles for

545
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:24,879
each nutrient

546
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
i was thinking about cloning and i'm

547
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:30,559
like well

548
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,560
you you can do a lot of that with feel

549
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,399
but when you go to check the roots and

550
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,278
you'll know this better than i do

551
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,958
so i've got the the plant and a plug i

552
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,198
pull that plug out to

553
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,119
to visually inspect if there are roots

554
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,479
but if i can't visually inspect how

555
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,440
sensitive are those to

556
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
to touch personally i never interact

557
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,480
with them

558
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,680
really until i go to transplant them and

559
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,079
then it's only

560
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,479
to gently set them in their cup right

561
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,039
and coat them with dirt can they handle

562
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,600
can you give them a gentle a gentle rub

563
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,360
to feel

564
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,199
how your roots are developing yeah i

565
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,838
think i think a little squeeze would be

566
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,279
okay but there's some situations that

567
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,438
can you squeeze to tell if the buds are

568
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:13,038
ripe like that's

569
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,959
um no but you can otherwise

570
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:19,838
um it's an eight week plant

571
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,360
you and i have both run schedules where

572
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,480
we would prefer

573
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:27,838
to check every plant with a scope

574
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,919
or a loop and look for

575
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,200
amber versus not amber versus white

576
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,520
versus cloudy

577
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,038
but we can't because we have to harvest

578
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,480
this [ __ ] on wednesday

579
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,319
because the next crop goes in on

580
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,640
thursday morning

581
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,599
so that it can be in flower by next

582
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,160
monday

583
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,519
yeah um you both know we both know how

584
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
that is so yeah

585
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,000
so pick a nine weeks straight yourself

586
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,919
up for success finding a strain that

587
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,679
you can hope will be relying on a

588
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,759
timetable and

589
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,600
um there's gonna be a lot of those

590
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,038
little tricks that you and i just can't

591
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,639
wrap our heads around yet because we're

592
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,558
not used to thinking with that

593
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,679
perspective exactly that's why i'm

594
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,359
reaching out and asking for

595
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,200
our other hopefully we've got a blind

596
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,319
audience a blind community that can help

597
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,519
us out and give us

598
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,839
some tips and tricks that they have

599
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,400
learned i look forward to hearing back

600
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
from

601
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,160
not only our new friend the blind grower

602
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,600
uh the inspiring grower but also

603
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,840
uh more listeners who have got some

604
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,678
ideas for us i wish i had more tips

605
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,839
this is something i've never that's like

606
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,400
yeah i've never played

607
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,159
you say that doesn't sound right as you

608
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,679
go looking for what piece of gear isn't

609
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,640
operating correctly

610
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,120
because you've got that [ __ ]

611
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
musician's ear so

612
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,479
you're they're so much more sensitive

613
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,880
than mine like i'll hear if

614
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,400
the ac is not running or some [ __ ] but

615
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,760
you'll catch all sorts of tiny little

616
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,280
pieces of equipment that i never even

617
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,960
hear

618
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,798
so i'm sure that's even more amplified

619
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,038
for somebody who's relying on that

620
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,798
sense more than their site can hear that

621
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,839
[ __ ] dehumidifier leaking all the

622
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:55,359
time nobody said nobody believed me

623
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,678
thing was leaking bro it's filled with

624
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,279
water

625
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,720
yeah i'm sure that especially with

626
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,879
the wife to help practice stuff

627
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,038
that we we can 100 figure out how to do

628
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
this yeah

629
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,319
shout out to the wife all right we're

630
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,679
gonna move on to a next message uh to

631
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,279
the next message

632
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,038
hopefully we can give a more solid

633
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,558
answer to this one yes

634
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,319
um i'm pretty sure we can i'm good at

635

00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,519

672
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,599
message

673
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,279

for your message on

675
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,879
the show it says my reason for writing

676
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,798
is seed

677
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,080
banks i know you have your own seed

678
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,240
banks you work with

679
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,359
and all like uh and then he put a couple

680
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,679
he listed a few of them

681
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,000
seeds here now at dank store are pros

682
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,960
i've recently had a rash of bad

683
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,319
seeds i've gotten them all from europe i

684
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,319
think we all know who that

685
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,599
is and then he says uh shh and then he

686
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,240
mentions the company we know if they're

687
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,158
coming from

688
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,919
uh from europe we probably know who they

689
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,120
are oops uh and it says

690
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,400
i've gotten from some from us breeders

691
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,158
and then he mentions a couple of us

692
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
breeders and i don't want to say their

693
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,240
names because i know some of these

694
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,759
people

695
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,200
and i know that some of them offer great

696
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,558
seeds and i know that some of them offer

697
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,720
not so great seeds

698
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,639
it goes on to say what is the deal with

699
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,279
quality control

700
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,120
why so many bad seeds out there and what

701
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,399
companies take care of their customers

702
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,558
i've gotten replacements

703
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,519
from some but others are anything but

704
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,200
friendly

705
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,519
uh he lists a company and he says this

706
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,240
company for example told me they do not

707
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,480
replace

708
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,839
freebies um let me back up and touch on

709
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,798
a couple of things because you did ask

710
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:32,158
what's the deal with quality control

711
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,759
it depends on like everything else bro

712
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,520
yeah there's no standard that's part of

713
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,879
the problem there's no standard

714
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,519
mini breeders are a name on a website

715
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,039
you click on [ __ ] i don't want to

716
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,798
single out any website i'm gonna make up

717
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,400
something

718
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:48,079
seeds.com you click on this website and

719
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,519
then you find a breederfuckingx and you

720
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,119
read his strain you go that sounds like

721
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,720
awesome description i want to buy it

722
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,158
that's your only connection between you

723
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,240
and breederx they can put

724
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,000
popcorn seeds in that [ __ ] container

725
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,480
the vendors that sell it

726
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,839
vet them good vendors vet their breeders

727
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,200
and don't allow that to happen

728
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,558
where you bought from they carry

729
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,919
everybody on the planet and things i've

730
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,440
never heard of before

731
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,960
uh they they're not gonna send you

732
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,798
popcorn seeds but there's no quality

733
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
control on the seeds that go out

734
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,279
what's the i pack the seeds for ire

735
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,759
genetics are the packs they go out

736
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,399
some breeders hire other people to pack

737
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,240
the seeds

738
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,000
and it's up to that person to select a

739
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,000
grade seeds and not give you b

740
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,599
or c grade seeds so that's part of the

741
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,798
process who packed them was it the owner

742
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,319
of the company was it one of his

743
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,319
flunkies was it his wife

744
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,599
was it somebody that knows is it was it

745
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,000
somebody that cares

746
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,879
so it's all about did they pick [ __ ]

747
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,640
quality seeds

748
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,200
there is no quality control it's all

749
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,559
about each company's own quality control

750
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
the quality control comes on the

751
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,759
consumer end on things like you're going

752
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,240
to go to the internet and you're going

753
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,759
to say

754
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,359
you're going to say all of the names i

755
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,720
blanked out on this you're going to say

756
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,399
all that [ __ ] on the internet

757
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,079
on the correct forums in the appropriate

758
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,519
places that's how quality control

759
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,960
happens in the seed industry

760
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,038
unfortunately so uh quality control

761
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,960
why so many bad seeds out there because

762
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,079
people can sell you seeds and never have

763
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,919
to face you again

764
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,759
i put my face out here i am irie

765
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,520
genetics i represent my company

766
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,279
if you come to our booth at an event

767
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,960
it's going to be probably myself

768
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,879
mike and one or two other people helping

769
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,880
us out but it's always going to be me

770
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,720
unless i'm talking or doing something

771
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,760
but i'm at the booth that's my job i'm

772
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,120
supposed to be there

773
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,400
they want to come talk to me you're

774
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,239
going to see me if you've got a problem

775
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,679
with my seeds you can politely say hey

776
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,640
i had an issue let's talk about it we'll

777
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,919
sit down and talk about it you'll

778
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,440
probably get a replacement if you've got

779
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
a real story

780
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,720
mike will probably be there too we put

781
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,798
our faces out there

782
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,640
so many people don't and if you don't

783
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,400
have to put your face out there

784
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,759
who knows what bad [ __ ] and

785
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,200
there may be a seed company called bad

786
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,440
[ __ ] seeds at this point

787
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,798
but whatever it's just an ad in the

788
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,960
paper as far as

789
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,918
yes it's a clicky thing on the internet

790
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
and you don't know who you're

791
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,919
interacting with or who you're talking

792
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,839
to

793
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,679
and so that's why people are able to get

794
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,199
away with it uh so that's the deal with

795
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,000
quality control that's why so many bad

796
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,480
seeds

797
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
uh what companies take care of their

798
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,839
customers

799
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,360
i know that and this is not advertising

800
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,480
or a sales pitch i know

801
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,519
that everybody at seeds herenow.com has

802
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
been personally

803
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,839
selected by james bean james b knows the

804
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,558
maker of all of the seeds on that

805
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,000
website

806
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,359
you have to shake his hand you have to

807
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,798
have a meeting with him you have to hang

808
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,038
out with him

809
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,879
he's a lot like me you could make him a

810
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,720
lot of money but if he doesn't like you

811
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,720
he will not put you on his website

812
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,079
that's simply how he works like no i

813
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
don't like your business that business

814
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,240
ethics

815
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,919
something about you makes me kind of

816
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,200
uneasy i don't need to do business with

817
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,799
you and he'll pass on you

818
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,558
so you got to be a good breeder to get

819
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,639
on seeds herenow.com

820
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,038

821
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,799

822
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,640

went wrong

825

most of the time you will get a

826
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,720
replacement pack of seeds if seeds are

827

now.com does not replace an irie

828
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,000
genetics pack

829
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,918
i will that's part of my my [ __ ]

830
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,119
quality control customer services if

831
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,679
you've got a problem with the pack of

832
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,278
seeds

833
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,960
i can afford to lose it more than you

834
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,079
can i'd much rather replace it and make

835
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,079
you happy

836
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,000
i'd rather eat a pack of seeds than eat

837
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,079
a customer eat my reputation

838
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,119
it's that easy for me and i know the

839
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,399
next pack will be good because there's

840
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,759
not going to be two bad packs in a row

841
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,200
that's very unlikely

842
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,759
so i don't know who takes care of their

843
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,919
company their service other customers

844
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,558
on a seed breeder level i know that the

845
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,159
vendors that seeds herenow.com has top

846
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,038
shelf customer service

847
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,960
i can highly recommend them um let's see

848
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,919
where are we gun replacements from some

849
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,640
but some are anything but friendly yeah

850
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,480
keep in mind though a lot of people will

851
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
just send breeders an email saying hey i

852
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,360
bought a pack of seeds they didn't

853
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,959
germinate give me replacements

854
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,879
and you can tell by the wording of the

855
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,319
message if they're scamming you or if

856
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
it's real ninety percent of the time i

857
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,519
can tell by the words

858
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,200
um so they're they're dealing with a lot

859
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,960
of that then

860
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,640
one company said they don't replace

861
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,880
freebies

862
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,640
uh they were freebies i don't know i i

863
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,960
don't know how to feel about that

864
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,559
i don't know uh paid money to be

865
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,840
eligible for that seed oh yeah because

866
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,359
you got to buy so many to get the

867
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,319
freebie so it was like a bait and switch

868
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,839
and then you gotta

869
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,158
so yeah they should replace that [ __ ]

870
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,839
for you um

871
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,360
and if it's bunk wouldn't you stand

872
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,599
behind your product

873
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,479
yeah i stand behind my [ __ ] so uh what

874
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,678
does one seed cost

875
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,278
um varies wildly yeah that varies wildly

876
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,720
how big is your production facility how

877
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:17,119
many people work for you and i know i'm

878
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,960
giving

879
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,399
vague [ __ ] politician answers right

880
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,360
now um

881
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,000
seeds are not expensive you guys like on

882
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,439
a wholesale

883
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,960
level at the level that the vendors are

884
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,798
buying seeds seeds are not expensive

885
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,240
it's the i don't know i don't want to

886
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,359
disclose too many like i don't know i

887
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
may have signed

888
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,519
paper saying i won't tell that part with

889
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,200
a lot of stuff you're not necessarily

890
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,038
paying for like

891
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,319
the pro can come over and fix what's

892
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:43,759
wrong in 30 minutes

893
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,599
but like you're not paying him for the

894
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,879
30 minutes you're paying him for the 15

895
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,158
years it took him to learn how to do it

896
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,320
in 30 minutes right

897
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,080
it's the same thing with breeding like

898
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,200
you're not paying for the cost

899
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:58,720
to produce a single seed you're paying

900
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,440
for the time thought energy effort work

901
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,720
dedication love that it took to breed

902
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,000
both those parents

903
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,640
then cross them then test them then

904
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,720
re-test them then stabilize them

905
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,960
and market them their packaging

906
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,880
lab testing each individual seed is no

907
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,880
it's not super pricey to produce

908
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,558
people [ __ ] up and produce seeds for

909
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,119
free all the time

910
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,720
yeah but those seeds nobody knows what

911
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,398
they are nobody knows who they came from

912
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,880
so those seeds were they're not worth

913
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,639
anything

914
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,640
but i think we've got that those ones

915
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,600
that didn't germ

916
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,960
like it's all perspective so that he

917
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,959
wraps it up with so i thought who would

918
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,519
be the best to ask about this stuff and

919
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,720
rasta jeff anyway i hope all is good in

920
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,599
your life and keep

921
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,960
growing g uh my friend miles i hope i

922
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,519
answered your question

923
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,079
customer service is all based on the

924
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,000
breeder

925
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,678
it's all about what the breeder believes

926
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,319
is quality i think everything should

927
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,399
come in a

928
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,759
pretty well labeled package i don't like

929
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:58,959
too much handwritten [ __ ] if you get a

930
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,839
package for me directly and it's

931
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,600
handwritten

932
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,959
it's because i actually had to package

933
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,319
that pack of seeds up for you and i

934
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
didn't have a whole sheet of labels made

935
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,678
and i just hand wrote it for you

936
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,798
but it always comes on the folded card

937
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,240
it looks real good i try to keep them

938
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,000
super professional

939
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,440
like good quality packaging just make it

940
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,558
look professional make it look sharp

941
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,558
stuff like that

942
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,079
uh good seeds in there i try not to put

943
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:19,278
shitty seeds in the packages if i

944
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,038
wouldn't plant that if i wouldn't be

945
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,960
excited to open that if i bought it

946
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,558
like i don't put it in the package i

947
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,600
keep in mind i know that people

948
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,119
money is expensive people [ __ ] work

949
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,558
their time their energy their effort

950
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,839
they're away from their [ __ ] people

951
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,278
they're away from their family

952
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,119
they're away from the air conditioner

953
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,398
bro it's so hot right now

954
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,158
they're away from the air conditioner

955
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,519
for eight hours ten hours at a time

956
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,919
doing [ __ ] that sucks

957
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,359
listening to some [ __ ] yell at them

958
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,720
about [ __ ] that they're doing wrong that

959
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,398
is really not even their fault

960
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,079
i get it and they're giving me that

961
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,079
money that they made for a product

962
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,839
i understand uh i don't want them to

963
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,359
think [ __ ] i busted my ass and got [ __ ]

964
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,119
out of this i want them to think yeah

965
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,719
but i spent my money on is [ __ ] doing

966
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,678
it for me that always makes you feel

967
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,399
good

968
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,000

992
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,960
when i was a teenager in the mid 80s i

993
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,600
was schooled by three old hippie vietnam

994
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,679
vets

995
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,879
they used to use they used to pirate

996
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,519
grow sorry for that

997
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,360
in the national forest shame on you guys

998
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,359
i was the gopher for two seasons

999
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,678
anyway they had an afghan they ran

1000
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,158
exclusively in mile long rows

1001
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,600
on south southwest facing slopes it

1002
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,159
sounds like a great [ __ ] growth so

1003
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,359
far

1004
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,159
we would sew in a single row of 100 or

1005
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,319
so plants

1006
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,240
all right i can visualize this when they

1007
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,639
started showing sex we would call every

1008
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,599
male

1009
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,880
except the best looking male and give

1010
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,278
him only a day

1011
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,600
to start spewing anyway it would

1012
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,319
pollinate enough to ensure enough seeds

1013
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:22,719
for the next

1014
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,319
season that sounds about right so i was

1015
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,919
gifted a coffee can

1016
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,678
full of seeds yeah right

1017
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,360
that was their that was 10 years into

1018
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,640
their business

1019
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:37,839
so i think that's an s 10

1020
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,399
uh no not it says i think that's an s10

1021
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,519
which has been

1022
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,719
self for 10 generations uh no i want to

1023
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,000
jump in right there before i lose my

1024
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,200
train of thought it is not an

1025
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,440
s10 it was not self it is an f

1026
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,159
10 open pollination um

1027
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,840
so f is for filial generation self would

1028
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,880
be if we reversed one of the plants

1029
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,879
you've got a male

1030
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,640
so that is not a selfing that is an f

1031
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,240
you're going yeah you're going further

1032
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,038
with a filial generation so what

1033
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,120
happened was

1034
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,278
and who knows what f generation what

1035
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,798
filial generation they started with so

1036
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,119
they had a handful of seeds this is

1037
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,278
presumably because you said every year

1038
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,199
they planted a hundred seeds

1039
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:16,558
did the hundred so yeah probably from

1040
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,159
years before so you've got a hundred

1041
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,639
seats they planted them

1042
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,440
uh they picked a male so they took one

1043
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,360
male and open pollinated up to 99 other

1044
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,120
plants and gathered the seeds from there

1045
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,119
that's an open pollination because who

1046
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,079
knows which female

1047
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,599
those came from it's the same uh plants

1048
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,798
but it's an open pollination it's the

1049
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,480
same genetics but

1050
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,879
that way you get a lot of diversity you

1051
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,120
see a lot of great phenotypes that male

1052
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,159
has now hit every female phenotype in

1053
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,359
there they're probably

1054
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,159
somewhere between 4 12 16 maybe 32

1055
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,000
different phenotypes

1056
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,399
available in that female just because of

1057
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,960
genetics and that male could possibly

1058
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:52,959
pollinate

1059
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,798
all of those and then we get to see what

1060
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,399
that male does to all of those females

1061
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,038
for the next generation so

1062
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,759
he did that 10 times the first time it

1063
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:01,759
happened

1064
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,119
the first ones you planted that was f1

1065
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,038
then you took those seeds

1066
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,158
planted a hundred cold all the males you

1067
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:07,200
got one boy

1068
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,640
probably oh we're going to say there

1069
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
were 50 girls because they probably

1070
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,640
called 50 males

1071
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,759
uh 49 males kept one male got 50 girls

1072
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,759
left just because of the

1073
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,278
math and numbers there so that one male

1074
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,519
pollinated 50 girls

1075
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,278
and now you did an f2 open pollination

1076
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,159
and you just repeated that f3 open

1077
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,079
pollination

1078
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,840
it was not self because there was no

1079
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,519
selfing there was no reversal

1080
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,959
there was an actual male used in

1081
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,640
pollination so it was a filial

1082
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,880
generation moving forward

1083
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,399
in an open pollination style because

1084
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,000
you've got multiple females

1085
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:37,599
which is a really good way to find

1086
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,440
genetic diversity

1087
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,719
all right so that catches us up a little

1088
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,640
bit right there

1089
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,278
uh where are we gonna go from there i

1090
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,720
grew them for personal reasons only

1091
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:51,038
until my divorce in 2010 and then uh my

1092
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,679
genetics were mysteriously lost imagine

1093
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,158
that

1094
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,240
uh scotty would say hmm that's [ __ ]

1095
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,080
funny we got a dgc listener here

1096
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,919
then it goes on to say anyway my point

1097
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,359
is i want to find something as close to

1098
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,880
that as i can do you have any

1099
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,959
suggestions or ideas

1100
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,720
i was completely out of the game for 13

1101
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,278
years and damn it's a different world

1102
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,159
now

1103
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,679
i feel like rip van winkle sometimes i

1104
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,720
am forever grateful for you

1105
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,759
from apical meristem also known as they

1106
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,440
put their real name i'm not going to

1107
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,720
read that out loud but big shout out to

1108
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,798
our friend apical

1109
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,159
uh atypical meristem sorry i read that

1110
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,720
wrong the first time

1111
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,399
um the last part of that question

1112
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,399
they're looking for

1113
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,319
genetics like with these old hippies

1114
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,558
used to grow they had afghan

1115
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,079
um man i would recommend look for some

1116
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,839
pure afghan seeds you could probably

1117
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,359
find some pure

1118
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,639
seed banks yeah yeah some pure affy some

1119
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:44,158
l-a-o-g-a something like that

1120
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,919
i think dna genetics may be a good start

1121
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,600
they are harder to get into the states

1122
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,799
than a lot of other brands

1123
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,959
but some of that uh l.a kush og

1124
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,639
kush l-a-o-g affy that's the stuff

1125
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,480
you're gonna be looking for

1126
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,320
um i don't know if it's gonna be

1127
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,759
anything like what you were smoking 13

1128
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,759
years ago bro but

1129
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,839
um keep chasing that dragon that's like

1130
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,440
the growers [ __ ] thing that one thing

1131
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,000
we smoked that one time

1132
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,679
i've i've been looking for that p91 for

1133
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,719
so long but i think

1134
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,280
i think she's here we'll see we'll see

1135
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,799
yeah it's everybody's got that one in

1136
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,960
their head that they're still looking

1137
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,000
for still chasing i think i got mine

1138
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,320
dude and i'm excited but

1139
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,119
i'm i'm i'm always skeptical until i

1140
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,760
flower it

1141
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,480
but it looks right it looks right and i

1142
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
wouldn't know if it's

1143
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,119
flowered right or not because i never

1144
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,879
saw the plant i only got the buds

1145
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,480
delivered in ounce and pound packages

1146
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:33,918
so i don't know what the plant the

1147
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,639
[ __ ] flowers and the plants even look

1148
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,158
like

1149
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,358
right yeah the

1150
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,358
the old school stuff i think uh

1151
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:46,639
unfortunately a lot of it's been lost to

1152
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:48,878
time everything's been crossbred

1153
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,000
but you never know because everything's

1154
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,279
still half

1155
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
or more underground uh there are who's

1156
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,119
got what seeds in their sock drawer

1157
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,679
and luckily some of the uh later states

1158
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,119
to come into legalization and activism

1159
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,799
they're still way behind so some of

1160
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,400
those old genetics are still there

1161
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,400
they've still got some of that old [ __ ]

1162
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,240
so maybe somebody's got it

1163
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,838
maybe some old war vets got some [ __ ]

1164
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,239
from afghan that you know

1165

tent and

1220
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,119
immediately as soon as it got hot this

1221
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,759
summer it was one of the things i was

1222

waiting on

1223
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,200

1227
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:12,320
quickly when the heat comes

1228
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,280
yep yeah yeah yeah not running as many

1229
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,200
lights this summer

1230
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,640
holy [ __ ] dude no i uh it affected

1231
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,879
everything i remember arguing with

1232
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,719
owners because i couldn't get them to

1233
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,800
understand that trimmers can't work in a

1234
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,799
100 degree building for

1235
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,800
and and be the same level of productive

1236
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,000
as they are in a 75 degree space it's

1237
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,119
just

1238
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,239
the heat'll [ __ ] you quick yeah yeah and

1239
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,838
that

1240
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,759
we're talking about local weather [ __ ]

1241
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,159
now but uh we are in the

1242
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,760
high desert mid desert area and where we

1243
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,319
were the wind would come by

1244
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,119
and you could feel the water just leave

1245
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,200
your body

1246
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,800
like this dry hot wind would come by and

1247
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,319
you'd be like huh it just took my

1248
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,920
moisture oh [ __ ]

1249
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,359
like all the water would just go out of

1250
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,358
your whole body you need a gallon of

1251
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:58,719
water to replace it immediately

1252
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,078
well it's i mean it's not just we got

1253
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,879
high instead of talking about local

1254
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,240
weather it's just

1255
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,079
this is what the cannabis world's

1256
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,919

1257
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,359
mitigate those [ __ ] high temps and a

1258
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,000

00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,559
they can grow outside or they're going

1278
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,480
to grow outside regardless and

1279
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,599
