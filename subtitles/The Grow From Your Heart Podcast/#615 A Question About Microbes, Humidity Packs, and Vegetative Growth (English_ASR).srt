appreciate it where do we go from there

50
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,600
oh i wanted to do

51
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,280
something rare we don't do this on the

52
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,798
podcast a lot

53
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
i used to talk about what i do all the

54
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,960
time i used to talk about going to

55
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,960
comedy shows

56
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,399
i used to talk about going to concerts

57
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,679
uh guess what we don't get to do that

58
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,680
kind of [ __ ] anymore so

59
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
i've been doing some netflixing what did

60
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,520
i watch on netflix i recently watched

61
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,359
a documentary about the cecil hotel

62
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,280
uh to be really quick we'll just say

63
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,399
that that was a four-hour show

64
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,799
that could have been 45 minutes

65
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,920
so before you jump in too far the cecil

66
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
hotel

67
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,840
all of the answers are in the first 15

68
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
minutes of the show everything you

69
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,079
needed to know

70
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,239
was told to you in the beginning you

71
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,239
could put the whole damn story together

72
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,519
watch it if you're really interested but

73
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
ah man

74
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,760
four hours of my life i should have been

75
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,760
recording podcasts or doing something

76
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,959
way different that [ __ ] could have been

77
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:21,120
a 45 maybe an hour and 15 at the most

78
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,800
there was a lot of extra content that

79
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,640
did not need to be in there

80
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
long story could have been a really

81
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,000
short story

82
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,439
that's my review on the cecil hotel all

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,519
right where do we go from there

84
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,878
the new discord link in the last episode

85
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,439

the discord also this is completely

123
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,719
random i just heard it through my

124
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,158
headphones a moment ago don't know if

125
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,318
you guys can hear it

126
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,000
uh there are some cats in my

127
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,958
neighborhood and i don't know if they

128
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,598
are making

129
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,519
babies or having babies but they're

130
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,039
right over there just a little bit i

131
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,360
haven't identified exactly where i think

132
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,840
it's out of my yard but the yard next to

133
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
me

134
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,759
behind me ish there are some cats over

135
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,400
there either making

136
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,919
kittens or having kittens or something

137
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,519
similar or maybe i should go check

138
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,199
further but i'm pretty sure it's cats

139
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,480
doing cat things over there

140
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,798
but if it comes through the headphones

141
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,079
there's nobody

142
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,319
there's nobody tied up here nothing

143
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,200
weird is going on i think those are cats

144
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,000
i've been hearing it

145
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,759
randomly for a little bit this evening i

146
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,319
really want i want to believe that those

147
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,600
are cats making that noise

148
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,639
i'm starting to wonder what it really is

149
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,919
now i shouldn't have brought that up

150
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,439
anyway those are cats if it comes

151
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,519
through the microphone you guys i

152
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,120
i'm gonna we're gonna that's my story

153
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,918
and i'm sticking to it it's cats i think

154
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
they're making

155
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,359
making more kittens over there that's

156
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
what it sounds like to me all right

157
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
so i did say at the start of the show i

158
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,000
was going to answer some grow questions

159
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
let's get right to that part so we don't

160
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,560
have to talk about cats making kittens

161
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,199
anymore

162
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,478
um let's get right to the grow question

163
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,960
part this one came

164
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,240
from my email inbox and it came from i'm

165
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,638
looking to see if they want their name

166
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,918
said they did not give me a name to use

167
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,360
so i'm not going to give them

168
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,719
their name said but shout out to you

169

170
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
message

171
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,279
it goes just a like at this it says hey

172
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,240
ross to jeff i just started listening to

173
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,239
your podcast

174
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
and i really like it thank you i

175
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,800
appreciate that i appreciate you for

176
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,079
listening thank you

177
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
it said i'm not sure if you've been

178
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,079
asked or answered this before but

179
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,079
what are your thoughts on curing with

180
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,159
humidity packs and he actually listed a

181
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,918
brand name he said boveda

182
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,759
there are several brands of humidity

183
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,240
packs available i'm not going to

184
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,879
uh endorse or bash or promote or

185
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,199
belittle

186
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,478
any uh particular brand this is my

187
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,639
overall opinion

188
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,240
on the humidity packs which are used to

189
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
preserve dry and cure

190
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,360
uh originally were for cigars now

191
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,478
they're used in the cannabis industry

192
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,879
quite a bit

193
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,000
but let's talk about how i feel about

194
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,399
boveda packs

195
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
i don't really find it necessary to use

196
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,959
a boveda pack

197
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,720
if you dried and cured your product

198
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,279
properly in the beginning

199
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,280
um that does take a little bit of

200
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,799
experience to get to that point so

201
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,239
maybe if you're using it as a little bit

202
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,879
of a training wheel for drying and

203
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,879
curing

204
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,519
that's acceptable i don't need a boveda

205
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,038
pack to dry and cure my product

206
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,719
i don't think it's necessary but it's

207
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,478
helpful if it's working for you do it

208
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
don't stop doing something just because

209
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,439
rasta jeff doesn't do it i don't think

210
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,918
it's necessary

211
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,680
i think and this is my opinion mike

212
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,240
seems to agree with me a few people have

213
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,800
argued

214
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,800
some people agree with me sometimes i

215
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,160
think if you cure with the boveda pack

216
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,120
in there it gives it

217
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,199
sort of a moist different flavor that

218
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,959
you don't want in the finished product

219
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
if you wait until the product is

220
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,038
properly dried and cured and you're

221
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,400
preserving that moisture level with the

222
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,120
boveda pack

223
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,799
then it works well and it tastes good so

224
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,000
i don't think it's necessary for

225
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,360
actually drawing and curing

226
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,519
the product i think it's better for

227
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,280
long-term storage and for preserving

228
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,879
the freshness of the project product

229
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,679
once you've got it like stored for a

230
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,319
while

231
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,639
maybe more long-term storage not drying

232
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,360
and curing is what i'm trying to say vin

233
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,280
also my opinion has widely varied and

234
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
swayed back and forth over time when it

235
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,000
comes to

236
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,519
the boveda and other brand humidity

237
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,759
packs i've said before that

238
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,639
i think it kind of leaves a weird flavor

239
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,319
it kind of

240
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,918
and i could that could be completely

241
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,280
full of [ __ ] maybe it was something else

242
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,120
in the grow doing that

243
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,559
but i feel like it was making the buds

244
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,879
taste different when we quit using the

245
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,240
boveda packs the herb tasted better

246
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,199
in my opinion now we do i do live in

247
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,879
colorado

248
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
where i experience what is known as the

249
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,879
colorado crunch

250
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,598
if i go buy if i buy an eighth or an

251
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,439
ounce of weed

252
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,639
from the dispensary it's going to be

253
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,038
crunchy because

254
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,720
the dispensary weed is stored in a jar

255
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,598
on the shelf to where everybody can see

256
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,280
it that comes in

257
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,360
the bud tender grabs it sets it out in

258
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,879
front of you you smell it or maybe not

259
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,080
now during covid but during most times

260
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,439
you'd smell it

261
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,279
and then they open it up they pop off

262
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,719
the lid they weigh out either an eighth

263
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,918
or they weigh out at a quarter or maybe

264
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
your ounce if that's what you're buying

265
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,198
maybe two ounces if you're going hard

266
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,038
then they put the lid back on it and

267
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,800
they put it back on the shelf maybe they

268
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,560
popped open three or four other jars and

269
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,079
showed you all of those at the same time

270
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,360
that's happening with every customer

271
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,279
that comes in there so that weed is

272
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,680
getting super dry

273
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,959
if they put that herb back in a big

274
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
container at the end of the night with

275
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,680
the boveda package

276
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
and sealed it up or maybe just put some

277
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,519
boveda packs in that jar

278
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,680
that may prevent that colorado

279
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,878
crispiness that may be a good use

280
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,598
for the boveda pack there so if you're

281
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
slow drying it and slow curing it get it

282
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:13,759
as close

283
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,000
as you can to perfect then add the

284
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,120
boveda pack if you mess it up and get it

285
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
too dry

286
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,319
then that's when i would say to to

287
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,560
reintroduce that boveda pack and

288
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,919
re-moisten the product at that time but

289
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,478
i think if you're doing it right you

290
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,839
don't really need the boveda pack

291
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,240
um if you've got enough product to where

292
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,839
you

293
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,839
think you may need to store it with the

294
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,199
pack i'm not gonna like i said earlier

295
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,880
if you like it do it

296
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,479
maybe get a small jar and try it with

297
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,439
the boveda pack in a small jar and try

298
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
it without

299
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,159
i think if you dry and cure it properly

300
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,759
and you get a big jar that you keep your

301
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,080
like personal stash in

302
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,799
put a couple of packs in there just to

303
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,839
keep that one

304
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,439
long-term fresh then however often it

305
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,040
takes you to smoke and ate the weed

306
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,640
take an eighth out of your big jar put

307
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,319
it in your smaller jar and make that one

308
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,679
the jar that you pop open and

309
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,600
open and close all the time so you got

310
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,639
your big storage jar you got your

311
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,399
smaller jar

312
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,000
that way your big jar stays fresh it's

313
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,440
not getting cracked open all the time

314
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,799
then you got your smaller one that does

315
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,160
get opened and closed all the time when

316
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,919
you're reaching for a nug

317
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,519
maybe even put a boveda pack in with

318
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,120
that eighth maybe a quarter depending on

319
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,679
how hard you smoke

320
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
but you asked mainly about curing uh

321
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,079
thoughts on curing with boveda humidity

322
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,920
packs

323
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,160
i would prefer dry and cure without it

324
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,039
use a dialed in room use

325
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,719
jars use a humidifier and a dehumidifier

326
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,519
use a heater and an air conditioner use

327
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,040
those things

328
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,200
for your drying and curing and then once

329
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,199
it's in the jar trimmed up

330
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
uh just getting that final touch that's

331
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,959
when you can add the bovedas

332
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
in my opinion um i don't want to bash

333
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,159
the product i don't want to bash the

334
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,759
company many people love them

335
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,439
i just think if it's done properly you

336
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,958
don't need them until it comes to that

337
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,560
long-term storage

338
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,679
that's when they do come in very handy

339
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,359
they prevent you from getting that

340
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,439
colorado crunch

341
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,200
so put your big jar put a couple of

342
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,519
boveda packs in the big jar

343
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,959
and then uh if you've got some bud that

344
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,399
you did get from the dispensary that

345
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,199
came and it showed up all crispy and

346
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,879
crunchy

347
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,959
throwing a couple of boveda packs in

348
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,039
there that will help re-moisten

349
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,719
and stabilize that product all right i

350
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,240
think i rambled on long enough about the

351
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,440
boveda packs

352
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,919
i do have some friends that have a

353
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,959
podcast they did do the boveda challenge

354
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,199
where they put

355
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,039
some dried and cured herbs into two

356
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,759
different jars one with the bovida one

357
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,039
without

358
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,879
and you could tell the difference the

359
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,559
one with it was a little moister

360
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,919
moisture is that a word it is now

361
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,559
because i said it right somebody put

362
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,639
that in the

363
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,199
in the dictionary moisture it was more

364
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,559
moist one bud was more moist more supple

365
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,160
it burned a little differently

366
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,679
the other had that colorado crunch

367
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,639
effect that i talked about you could

368
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,239
just hear it go

369
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,679
if you broke it up by the microphone it

370
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,839
burned really quickly

371
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,759
but i didn't get to taste that herb so i

372
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,600
can't testify to the flavor

373
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:49,519
visually audibly it did look and appear

374
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
and sound like better product but i

375
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,919
didn't get to consume it

376
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,559
so i can't testify much to that but

377
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,360
ah the quick summary drying and curing

378
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,559
don't need it

379
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,839
storage or re uh what is it remoistening

380
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,078
is the word we're going to use

381
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,920
uh that is when i would use the boveda

382
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,838
packs got awful rambling on that one

383
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,199
this could be a long show

384
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,360
the next question oh by the way that

385
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,920
question came from my email box my email

386
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,440
in back inbox my email address is holy

387
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,879
[ __ ] that was hard to say

388
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,480
my email address is grow from your heart

389
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,399
at hotmail.com

390
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,079
since i put so much effort into it

391
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,240
please use that email address

392
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,278
send me your grow questions this

393
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
question came

394
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,559
from the grow help tab on my website my

395
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,959
website is iriegenetics.com

396
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,799
on that website you will find a tab that

397
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,359
says grow help if you click on that grow

398
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,439
help tab you can ask grow questions

399
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,720
we ask you a few preliminary questions

400
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
just to kind of give me an idea of

401
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
what's going on in your grow

402
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,919
then at the bottom it says the problem

403
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
and that's where you are given the

404
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,559
opportunity to tell me about the problem

405
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,638
in your grow

406
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,239
then i will read that on the podcast and

407
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,399
we will diagnose or

408
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,278
recommend some solutions for your

409
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,360
problem

410
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,879
that's where this question came from

411
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,919
they want me to use the name

412
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,439
t.420 on instagram so this one came from

413
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:08,958
t.420

414
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,399
t.420 is growing cookies kush from

415
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,838
barney's farm

416
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,200
they're growing washing machine from

417
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,399
ripper seeds and one smoothie auto by 42

418
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,240
fast buds and it was a sample seed

419
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,078
a lot of these details are not necessary

420
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,519
because i know the question

421
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,439
let's skip some of that what are you

422
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
feeding it they're feeding it remo

423
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,800
nutrients i don't know if that's ramo or

424
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,719
remo nutrients but shout out ramos a

425
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,199
cool ass dude up there in canada

426
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,480
growing with the ramo nutrients using

427
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
five mils of micro

428
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,320
five mils of grow five mils of velo kelp

429
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,159
eight mils of magnifical that sounds

430
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,600
like a [ __ ] great name for a product

431
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,759
for the calmag product

432
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,519
uh five mils of nature's candy i can

433
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,480
imagine that that's like a sweetener

434
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,440
and five eight milliliters of microbial

435
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
mass

436
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,959
and it says it's the first time i'll

437
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:58,000
continue to use this once every

438
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,439
two weeks uh then it says a little more

439
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,159
about the grow which isn't necessary for

440
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
the question

441
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,000
it says i have a small question here

442
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
since i'm starting the microbial mass

443
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,559
should i follow the dosage indicated on

444
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,559
the bottle or should i reduce it to half

445
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,879
as i have with the rest of my nutrients

446
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,879
like you suggest in your videos

447
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,480

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,879

450
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,560
chef when i was an apprentice

451
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,320
ah there's a lot of stuff there in that

452
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,078

knowing that you are learning a lot

457
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,159
uh the time that i put into this the

458
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,600
energy the equipment the effort

459
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,078
is worth it because you're learning a

460
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,399
lot that means a lot uh reminds me

461
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,000
of when you were of your chef when you

462
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,519
were the apprentice

463
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,519
i like that uh you could be the

464
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,320
grasshopper i'll be mr miyagi however

465
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,919
you want to do it

466
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,519
as long as you're learning bro i will

467
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,399
keep teaching i'm glad you're following

468
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,198
along

469
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,480
now uh let's get past the wax on wax off

470
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:55,919
portion and let's talk about the

471
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,480
recommendation here

472
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,838
you are using a microbial product called

473
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,839
microbial mass

474
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,279
i did a little quick research uh it

475
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,360
looks fancy it looks a little bit

476
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,679
expensive it's got a lot of fancy

477
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,399
microbes in there it's packaged up very

478
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,479
well as long as it is not too expensive

479
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,440
i would probably use that product as

480
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,680
recommended

481
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,720
i do recommend most the time that you

482
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,198
use most

483
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,560
products at about half to three quarters

484
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,559
of the recommended strength so

485
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,479
if it says use a hundred i say start

486
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,198
with 50 see how it responds

487
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,199
then try 75 see how it responds you

488
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,879
rarely have to go all the way up to 100

489
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,639
of what they recommend

490
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,320
i like to have faith in the companies

491
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
which we choose to work with

492
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,160
but they're in the business of doing

493
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,278
business their business is you buying

494
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,120
more nutrients

495
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,958
if they can get you to splash on just a

496
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
few extra milliliters

497
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,319
a few times a week that's that much

498
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
sooner you got to buy

499
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,920
that many more bottles so if they can

500
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,159
get you to use it more quickly they

501
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,519
certainly will and they're not in your

502
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,879
grow they don't know what you're growing

503
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,919
how you're growing when you're growing

504
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,000
what you're doing

505
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,519
so those are recommendations i would

506
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,958
start with about half of that maybe your

507
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,399
plants are going to [ __ ] thrive a lot

508
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,000
of plants respond better

509
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,078
with a little bit of nutrients when you

510
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,078
start putting more on you start seeing

511
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,239
what the nutrients do not what the plant

512
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,799
does and i like to see what my plants do

513
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,560
then adapt my nutrients to that so in

514
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,679
most cases i would recommend starting

515
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,599
with about 50

516
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,000
of the recommended dosage on the bottle

517
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,639
then work your way up maybe to 75 maybe

518
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,078
80.

519
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,839
you're rarely going to get up to need a

520
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,958
100 of the recommended dosage on the

521
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,000
bottle i don't know if you guys hear the

522
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,278
weird noises happening in my

523
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,559
neighborhood but i'm sorry if i look

524
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,600
distracted momentarily

525
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,879
because i certainly certainly was all

526
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
right let's get back on track

527
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,000
uh you're probably going to need 50 to

528
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,720
75 percent of the recommended dosage on

529
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,078
the bottle

530
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,440
for the micro products however the other

531
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,758
products let me back up the other

532
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,040
products you do have the opportunity the

533
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,800
potential to burn

534
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,078
your plants you can cause problems you

535
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,039
can burn the leaf tips you can burn the

536
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,799
whole damn leaf

537
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,958
you can cause root issues you can cause

538
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,039
lockouts you can disrupt the soil and

539
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,799
the plant growth altogether

540
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,879
with a lot of those products those salty

541
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,439
products the shalated buffered nutrients

542
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,639
can do a lot of damage the micro

543
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,959
products i don't

544
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,039
really in my opinion feel like you can

545
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,719
overdose on microbe products

546
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,078
the thing to think about there is cost

547
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
effectiveness you said you were going to

548
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,758
use it every two weeks

549
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,359
um i think i'd like to see it every

550
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,039
maybe every once a week if you're going

551
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,159
to use a micro product i didn't research

552
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:19,919
how often to use it

553
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,240
but in my opinion it feels like once a

554
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,000
week is enough to keep those colonies

555
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,440
thriving just to get those microbes

556
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,958
whatever you've got going on

557
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,279
once a week gets them going if you're

558
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,919
using tap water if you're using filtered

559
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,278
water

560
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,278
some of your microbes are going to be

561
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,039
destroyed by environmental factors by

562
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,799
competition within the root zone

563
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,559
maybe just by chlorine in your water

564
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,758
maybe chloramine in your water

565
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,838
a lot of things are going to be

566
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,440
competing and destroying your microbes

567
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,519
so maybe if you use a little bit too

568
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,959
much all you're doing is supercharging

569
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,639
overpowering the other things and

570
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,359
keeping that microbe colony

571
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,039
super strong within your rhizosphere so

572
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,800
if it is cost effective and

573
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,480
it's not cutting into your budget if

574
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,000
you're still able to afford the rest of

575
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
your nutrients and eat like a king and

576
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,799
buy good concentrates i would say feed

577
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,160
that bad dog

578
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,359
that micro product as recommended if it

579
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,199
feels excessive

580
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,639
maybe reduce it you said you're going to

581
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,519
do it every two weeks

582
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,959
i again unless it says to do it every

583
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,038
two weeks i would almost do it every

584
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,919
once a week every other micro product i

585
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,199
can think of

586
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,360
they recommend doing it once per week so

587
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,798
i'd read the bottle see if they say once

588
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,599
a week or once every two weeks and

589
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:25,359
basically

590
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,119
if you're gonna use the rest of remo's

591
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,119
instructions the rest of his bottles

592
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,959
i would just go with what he recommends

593
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,798
at that recommended level because

594
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,960
uh i've seen ramos plants and i've seen

595
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,200
what he does and that dude has a

596
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
kick-ass garden eh so uh shout out to

597
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,919
remo and ramon nutrients if that's the

598
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,440
dude then i'm thinking that makes these

599
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,038
nutrients right it's gotta be

600
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,880
that's the dude's name it's gotta be

601
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:48,000
what you're using yeah shout out to ramo

602
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,760
um yeah so just use the recommended uh

603
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,960
part on that micro product i really

604
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,319
don't think you'll overdo it i don't

605
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,240
think you'll overdose it

606
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,918
and you'll just be compensating for

607
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,359
anything that may be destroying

608
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,520
any of the microbes that you've already

609
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,759
got going on if it's chlorine chloramine

610
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,960
or competition within the root zone and

611
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,359
if you've got a bunch of microbes in

612
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,640
there

613
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,519
that just prevents you from getting

614
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
other bad or other things which may be

615
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,558
bad

616
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,960
into that root zone big shout out to my

617
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,798
friend t.420

618
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,319
uh that's his instagram name he wants to

619
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,918
be called t.420

620
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,678
thank you for the great great question

621
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,240
bro i hope i was able to help you out

622
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,960
go ahead and use that product if it is

623
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
cost

624
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,360
effective one thing i should add and i'm

625
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,400
not trying to dis on anybody's nutrient

626
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,639
line but

627
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,480
if you do find that maybe you're using a

628
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,160
nutrient line and maybe the microbes

629
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,000
from that line are too expensive or

630
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,400
maybe the enzymes are too expensive or

631
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,440
maybe the calmag is too expensive

632
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,759
you don't have to always use

633
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,038
the full lineup of one company you don't

634
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,038
have to use

635
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,038
ramos everything everything everything

636
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,279
ramo if you find that there's a more

637
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:54,079
affordable more cost effective micro

638
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,160
product you can absolutely swap it out

639
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,000
for this microbial product if it

640
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,440
fits your budget your wallet your style

641
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,880
your grow better

642
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,279
um but with that being said be very

643
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,960
careful that you don't overlap anything

644
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,038
when you're reading the bottles see what

645
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,038
your npk values are your nitrogen

646
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,798
phosphorous potassium see how much if

647
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,558
there's calcium or magnesium in one

648
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,079
bottle maybe there's boron and copper

649
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,000
and zinc in one bottle

650
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,918
make sure you're not overlapping any

651
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,640
nutrients in two different bottles

652
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,280
because

653
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,799
this company probably put a few elements

654
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,480
in a couple of bottles and you can mix

655
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,639
them up and get the ideal mix but

656
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,240
this other company did similar but they

657
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,759
mixed bottles a little bit differently

658
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,079
so you do have the potential

659
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,919
to maybe overlap nitrogen or phosphorous

660
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,359
or potassium or calcium

661
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,840
it is possible so it's your

662
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,399
responsibility to read those bottles and

663
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,279
make sure

664
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,038
but as a as a grower as a breeder with a

665
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,599
lot of experience

666
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,359
i've talked about using veg bloom and

667
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,159
new millennium at the same time but i'm

668
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,240
also mixing

669
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,679
in what's that bloom booster that i can

670
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,599
never remember the name of the one with

671
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,360
the bat guano stuff on it

672
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,879
bud swell there we go i just have to

673
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,759
stop thinking about it the name comes to

674
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,080
my brain

675
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,038
i'm also mixing in bud swell i'm also

676
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,000
mixing in

677
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,158
uh silicium i also mix in other products

678
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
that are not new millennium or

679
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,799
uh veg bloom based so there are other

680
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
random products that do go into my grow

681
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,759
because they work well with my recipe

682
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,640
it's all about

683
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,158
uh if even if you give a professional

684
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,159
chef a written recipe

685
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,679
he's going to go ah you said to use this

686
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,880
i want to use this and make it mine

687
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,759
because he's the chef and i'm the

688
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,840
[ __ ] grower

689
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,679
and i know what results i'm looking for

690
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,079
so i'm able to kind of manipulate my

691
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,640
feeds custom tailor my feeds

692
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,199
dial in my feeds to give me exactly what

693
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
i need

694
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,679
for the outcome which i need uh that way

695
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,200
it like week three if i say oh man i'm

696
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,120
running a little bit low on this i can

697
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,038
grab something and i know what to mix in

698
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,798
to add that to make my plants go kapow

699
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,839
shabang i'm not limited by

700
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,400
what this lineup says to do maybe i only

701
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,399
need

702
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,720
one element and this all these bottles

703
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,159
have three elements in each bottle and i

704
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
just need one thing maybe i've got a

705
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,200
product that's got that one

706
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,240
[ __ ] thing and they're ready readily

707
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,919
available i don't have to add the

708
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,038
nitrogen and the other stuff in there

709
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,559
get that one in there with the other

710
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,400
bottle from another brand

711
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,678
just but be careful if you go doing that

712
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,360
stuff you guys but don't think that you

713
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,200
have to buy just because you bought

714
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,639
one brand of something doesn't mean you

715
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,000
have to stick with that entire lineup

716
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,919
it's much easier when you're a beginner

717
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,599
grower to do that but as you get better

718
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,000
maybe you can add some other things

719
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,199
i feel like i've said enough into that

720
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,440
let's keep

721
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,640
going with this podcast i think the cats

722
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,759
are done i haven't heard them in a few

723
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,919
minutes

724
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,919
hopefully i didn't just jinx myself the

725
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,840
next message came from my email no this

726
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,799
one came from patreon this one came from

727
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,240

737
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,399
birthday weekend i think this episode

738
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,039
will come out on my birthday

739
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,559
so i'll be smoking dabs and eating cake

740
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,720
and having a good ass time

741
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,279
i promise you i had a good weekend it

742
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,038
says i just listened to episode 603

743
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,399
on the topic of light leaks and i don't

744
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,200
think i heard you mention

745
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,280
a dark period for vegetative plants if

746
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,960
you did i'm sorry i missed that

747
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,480
yes i did talk about light leaks in

748
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,640
depth on a previous episode

749
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,839
and i did not talk about vegetative

750
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,759
plants very much

751
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,119
vegetative plants get overlooked quite

752
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,000
often we're going to discuss that here

753
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,158
in just a moment

754
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,240
the message goes on to say i do see a

755
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,200
lot of growers treating the dark period

756
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,640
in veg with the same rules as flower can

757
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,200
you please mention that

758
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,240
can you please mention that during veg

759
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,120
you do not need

760
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,319
uninterrupted darkness uh then it says

761
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,319
great show as always

762
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:43,599
thanks from coach steve uh you are

763
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,359
you are right technically in uh in

764
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,599
you're right we don't need on an

765
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,719
uninterrupted darkness in the vegetative

766
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,240
stage

767
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,079
but do you like getting woken up when

768
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,000
you're sleeping bro either to the plants

769
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,359
uh they're doing there are processes

770
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,279
happening when they're sleeping so it's

771
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,759
best not to disrupt them

772
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,119
we can but it's best not to once they've

773
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,679
gone to sleep for their

774
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,519
uh if it's four to six maybe eight hours

775
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,080
it's best just to let them rest but it

776
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,918
is not

777
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,599
nearly as critical if you must interrupt

778
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,120
a light cycle in a grow

779
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,279
let it happen during the veg so if

780
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,719
you've got to set up a grow space

781
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,158
and you've got like two rooms and you

782
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
have to walk through one to get to the

783
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,159
other

784
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,159
always make the walk through room the

785
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,679
veg space because you can have that one

786
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,360
on you can turn it on if you need to get

787
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,720
through there the flower room you cannot

788
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,479
interrupt that's what we discussed in

789
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,919
the previous episode

790
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,159
but you're correct it is mostly

791
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,000
mostly important not to interrupt that

792
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,679
dark period during the veg stage

793
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,359
uh just because things are happening

794
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,919
that's when a lot of processes happen is

795
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,519
at night

796
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,360
so the plants are just chilling they're

797
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,480
doing a lot of processing and we don't

798
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,759
want to disrupt that you don't like

799
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,159
being woken up in the middle of the

800
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,679
night

801
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,200
so just let them process let them do

802
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,080
their things but it is not critical

803
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,278
you're not going to cause

804
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,720
hermaphroditism

805
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,720
they're not going to freak out on you it

806
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,839
won't be hypercritical

807
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,360
so um let's talk more about the veg

808
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,399
phase because i did like that

809
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,839
inspiration

810
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,519
uh you're right it's not as critical to

811
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,959
keep them in the dark phase

812
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:09,278
but the veg phage phase is often

813
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,440
overlooked and people weigh heavily only

814
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,519
focus like i did in that episode

815
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,880
heavily heavily they focus too much on

816
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,599
the flower phase

817
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
so let's talk briefly here about the

818
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,519
vegetative stage of growth and why

819
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,200
i feel veg is often overlooked and super

820
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,639
duper i don't think i've said super

821
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,798
duper since i was a kid

822
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,400
it's super duper important to have a

823
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:34,158
solid veg

824
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,798
strategy a solid veg space a solid veg

825
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,840
feeding regimen a good vegetative goal

826
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,079
um

827
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,000
a strategy that all of that is under the

828
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,599
word strategy is what i started with veg

829
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,880
is way important and people completely

830
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,038
forget about that

831
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,919
the vegetative stage is where we are

832
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,000
working on healthy roots

833
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,440
healthy roots is where we get healthy

834
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,798
fruits if you don't have healthy plants

835
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,840
on the bottom you can't get healthy

836
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:57,918
plants up top

837
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,879
so we're working on healthy roots we're

838
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,840
working on

839
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,360
general basic plant health so that when

840
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,119
we start packing on weight

841
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,719
these plants are ready when we start

842
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,918
putting them under 12 12 and things

843
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
start going haywire

844
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,278
and their hormonal systems they can

845
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,960
transfer nice and smoothly

846
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,798
if they are hit by a pest or something

847
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,278
in flour we want them super strong in

848
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,599
veg

849
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,359
so that they are ready for this so this

850
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,000
is the foundation of

851
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,959
everything do you want your plants to go

852
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,440
to flower

853
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,240
looking like me i'm tall and skinny i'm

854
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,080
six foot five and like 180 pounds

855
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,558
or do you want your plants going to

856
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,119
flower looking like brock lesnar he's

857
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,240
like six

858
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,959
two and like [ __ ] 280 bro he could b

859
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,480
pick me up snap me in half eat part of

860
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,558
me and store rest of me for

861
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
later so would you rather have your

862
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,319
plants go into flower

863
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,679
looking like this or looking like this

864
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,200
and there's still not much there when i

865
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,840
do that but you see what i'm trying to

866
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,120
do right

867
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,199
would you rather have them looking like

868
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,278
this pin or looking like my wrist which

869
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,519
still i know not much difference but

870
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,880
that is up to you and that all happens

871
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,158
in the vegetative

872
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,440
stage of your growth um

873
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,679
shaping topping popping twisting

874
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,038
bottoming lollipopping these are all

875
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,278
things that should start

876
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,038
in the vegetative growth if you're going

877
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,839
to put your plants in a trellis and net

878
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,679
them out

879
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,879
that should happen in the vegetative

880
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,120
growth stage

881
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
people are forgetting to do a lot of

882
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,599
things in veg

883
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,558
lack of work and veg creates [ __ ] plants

884
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,119
in flower

885
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,960
shit-shaped plants in flower struggle

886
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,479
buds in flower buds that are too tall

887
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,880
buds that are floppy

888
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,079
uh one bud that's way up here one bud

889
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
that's way over here

890
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,439
one bud that's way this tall so your

891
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,798
light's gotta be way up here

892
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,080
and you've got these little buds down

893
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,679
here that aren't getting a lot of light

894
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,798
but these couple of buds are sticking up

895
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,080
way close to the light and you're

896
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,158
freaking out

897
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,798
veg is where we can fix and prevent and

898
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,520
prepare for all of these problems

899
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,000
so shape them and veg pop them twist

900
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,000
them bend

901
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,839
them down get them the structure that

902
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,400
you want the strength and vigor that you

903
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,558
want

904
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,240
prepare them in the vegetative stage set

905
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,759
yourself up for success

906
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,079
before we go into flour also any mistake

907
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,119
you make in the veg phase

908
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,798
prolongs your flowering stage i like to

909
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,879
correct any problems before i go to

910
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,119
flower i don't like to go into flower

911
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,559
with problems because you can't spray

912
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,079
you can't do as many things to the

913
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,480
plants once you're into flower

914
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,119
so i need my issues of the room of the

915
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,200
grow

916
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,839
in my life i need all of the problems

917
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,399
resolved before we go into the flowering

918
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,398
phase

919
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,519
so if you've got an issue in veg you got

920
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,678
to correct that [ __ ]

921
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,440
quickly get your plants back on track

922
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,679
now not only are you

923
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,720
lacking growth and performance and vigor

924
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,120
from the plants

925
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,399
uh potential that is potential potency

926
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,278
harvest weight of what you're going to

927
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:42,639
get in the end

928
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,480
because you're [ __ ] up in the veg

929
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,520
phase you got to correct that you've got

930
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,159
to recover

931
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,720
now you're also behind you're probably

932
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,200
minimum

933
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,640
a week to two weeks behind from any

934
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,080
[ __ ] problem that happens in your

935
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,159
grow if you get spider mites

936
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,158
it's gonna take you a solid two weeks to

937
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,760
get rid of them another week to recover

938
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,440
another week to get back on track now

939
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,079
you're [ __ ] four weeks behind in your

940
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,759
grow

941
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,000
because you weren't taking good enough

942
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,158
care of the vegetative

943
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
stage that is where the preventative

944
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,919
pest management happens that's where all

945
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,599
the shaping and structuring happens

946
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,120
that's where route development happens

947
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,599
this is where all of the planning should

948
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,479
take

949
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,319
place because this is the foundation the

950
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
structure the infrastructure

951
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,759
for the future plants that we are

952
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,798
growing do you want to grow struggle

953
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,200
buds or do you want to grow

954
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:27,839
big fat donkey dicks do you want one big

955
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,360
bud

956
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,959
that's touching the light with a bunch

957
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,000
of [ __ ] at the bottom or do you want

958
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,079
a nice canopy an even row of buds that

959
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,119
fills the entire room with a nice

960
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,199
airflow

961
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,319
beautiful [ __ ] everything is clean

962
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,519
and organized

963
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:46,079
that's up to you but it starts it starts

964
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,599
at day one of the vet it starts from the

965
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,439
day you cut that clone it starts when

966
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,639
you start thinking about the room

967
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,840
uh let me segue in to that one

968
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,880
the room people don't spend enough money

969
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,398
attention time and details and effort on

970
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,799
their vegetative stage

971
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,678
in their vegetative room i'm sorry they

972
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,519
think they can just

973
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,159
hang up a light and they've got a veg

974
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,839
room in some cases that will work

975
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,200
do you have a fan in there are you

976
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,119
controlling the humidity are you

977
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,960
controlling the temperature in that room

978
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,038
do you have something some sort of duct

979
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,240
that pulls old air out and moves

980
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,879
out the humidity do you have something

981
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,440
that brings in fresh air do you need or

982
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,520
have a humidifier or dehumidifier

983
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,880
is your bedroom setting you up for

984
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,558
success you spent all

985
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,559
i know you spent a bunch of money you

986
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,319
spent like 90 of your money on the

987
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,720
flowering room didn't you

988
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,359
you got the best lights you got the best

989
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,120
soil

990
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,199
you got the best [ __ ] pots you got

991
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,959
the best timer you got that thing on the

992
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,120
wall that all the lights plug into it's

993
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,960
got the best programmable [ __ ] on it

994
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,599
you got your pl minder unit or your

995
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,278
pulse monitor you got your co2 setup

996
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,480
going on you got it all cranking in the

997
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,079
flower room right

998
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,519
but you didn't spin [ __ ] in the bedroom

999
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,519
so by the time you get to that flower

1000
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,158
room those plants are wonky they're all

1001
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,879
[ __ ]

1002
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,039
un evenly shaped and [ __ ] look like

1003
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,960
charlie brown's christmas tree because

1004
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,398
people don't spend enough time effort

1005
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,960
energy money

1006
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:09,199
uh effort that's the bottom line effort

1007
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,200
and strategy there's no strategery

1008
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,000
happening in the bedroom so

1009
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,720
uh you end up with weak light not the

1010
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,319
right light

1011
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,000
lights of the wrong spectrum lights that

1012
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,960
are way too high or way too low from

1013
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,558
your plants

1014
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,240
uh i see bedrooms that are way too

1015
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,519
over packed because they were poorly

1016
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,038
planned there's not enough room for

1017
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,319
mother plants for flowering or for

1018
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,158
vegetative plants

1019
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,398
for clones for [ __ ] that needs to be

1020
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,600
transplanted they get way too packed in

1021
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,479
there they start getting tall and

1022
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,319
stretchy

1023
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,759
starts getting too humid in there start

1024
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:39,359
getting powdery mildew

1025
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,599
start getting lazy because they're too

1026
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,278
packed in start getting spider mites

1027
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,879
the plants start going into flower and

1028
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:45,359
pre-flowering because they're too packed

1029
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,278
in

1030
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,119
now your clones look like [ __ ] your next

1031
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,119
round of veg plants look like [ __ ]

1032
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,879
it all starts becoming a really quick

1033
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,558
[ __ ] struggle and it just takes a

1034
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,278
week of falling behind for all this [ __ ]

1035
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,678
to happen

1036
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,319
so prep your veg room have a really nice

1037
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,159
bedroom

1038
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,398
or i see people with their plants way

1039
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,799
too far apart a lot of wasted space in

1040
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:04,239
there

1041
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,079
they're just wasting money because the

1042
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,079
lights are running if you got like

1043
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,000
if you set up your bedroom to have two

1044
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,000
lights for when you have 24 big plants

1045
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,519
and right now you got 24 cups

1046
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,200
turn off that second light move those

1047
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,960
[ __ ] plants under the one light

1048
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,319
and quit wasting so much space you guys

1049
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,480
come on there's so many things you can

1050
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,798
do to set yourself up for success

1051
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,839
i see plants way too far apart way too

1052
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,079
close together

1053
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,959
another thing that breaks my heart is

1054
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,839
filthy

1055
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,480
filthy grow rooms sometimes i'm guilty

1056
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,000
of this

1057
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,440
sometimes it takes me a day or two to

1058
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,558
get my [ __ ] together and get everything

1059
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,519
caught up and cleaned

1060
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,000
but it doesn't stay filthy i see people

1061
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,000
with just

1062
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,240
grow rooms that were never even built to

1063
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,159
be clean or just never even thought

1064
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,679
about how sanitation could affect the

1065
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,200
quality of their product

1066
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,720
i'm not sure why i keep getting spider

1067
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,480
mites and fungus gnats and i go to look

1068
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,480
at your grow and it's like in a shed

1069
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,240
with a door that doesn't seal and the

1070
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,679
[ __ ] bark is peeling off the tree and

1071
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,960
falling off the tree through the ceiling

1072
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,320
into your grow space

1073
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,240
like there's all kinds of weird [ __ ]

1074
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,918
that i've seen in grows you guys clean

1075
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,640

1076
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,399

1077
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,080
take some pride in your work and those

1078
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:07,839
plants will show you they'll be like oh

1079
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,278

1083
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:17,439
that veg space so

1084
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:19,599
the veg space is just as important if

1085
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,240
not more important than your flowering

1086
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,959
space

1087
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,640
how long are your flowering lights on 12

1088
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,640
hours a day right

1089
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,559
plants are sleeping for 12 hours how

1090
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,840

1092
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,439
spend enough

1093
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,360
effort money time energy on making that

1094
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,240
a super fresh place for your plants to

1095
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,398
