I will do a full podcast episode about

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,680
why I had to move the website about the

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,520
uh the situation that happened and how I

36

resolved that and where we are now I

37
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,920
will do a full podcast about that but I

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,240
will probably put that on patreon that

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,799
will be patreon only content when I put

40

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,000
asking about I don't have any scientific

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,680
knowledge I didn't do any real research

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,199
this is just what I've experienced uh

103
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,000
with playing with genetics playing with

104
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,000
a lot of plants and what I think a lot

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,719
of this is my opinion we'll jump into

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that let me get to it uh the question

107
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,239
question is uh why does fox tailing

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,840
happen at all is there a way to avoid it

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,039
and is there even a need for it other

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,158
than avoiding the annoying extra labor

111
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,400
when it comes to trimming thanks a lot

112
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,078
and please keep up the great work dude

113

thank you for encouraging me to keep up

114
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,358

115
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,160
of weeks of episodes here uh I've been

116
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,918
doing shows every other week I've been

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,040
spending a lot of energy getting iy

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,799
direct going again uh that's been very

119
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,040
timec consuming very costly it's been a

120
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,038
little bit stressful to tell you the

121
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
truth and I've dedicated more time to

122
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:32,240
that than I should uh I should have been

123
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,600
here doing the podcast but I put more

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,560
energy into I redirect needed to get

125
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,520

140
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,679
question and quit rambling uh cuz I am

141
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,160
quite rambly today I've been smoking

142
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160
some uh toay taii to uh it's actually

143
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,639
called my taii to [ __ ] cake from Green

144
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,320
Dot uh it's an amazing dab it got me

145
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,038
super rambly let's stay focused it says

146
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,800
um the fox tailing why does it happen in

147
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:22,159
all happen at all sometimes uh that is

148
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,160
just basically a phenotypical expression

149
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,919
sometimes that plant is going to fox

150
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,639
tail uh no matter where you put it no

151
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,120
matter what environment that plant goes

152
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,160
into uh let me talk about fox tailing in

153
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,879
general a lot of times when we grow a

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,120
plant it makes a little like a pine

155
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,918
cone-shaped Bud sometimes it'll make a

156
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,680
fingery looking bud with weird finger

157
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,560
shapes coming out coming out of it weird

158
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,000
stacked cxes sometimes that is less or

159
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,439
more exaggerated depending on the plant

160
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,600
and the environment so those are your

161
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,079
fox tails a lot of people don't like

162
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,759
those like this grower said because it

163
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,199
is extra work when you were trimming

164
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,000
those are a pain in the ass to work

165
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,160
around and they're not super pretty in

166
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,038
the bag uh what causes that I was saying

167
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,800
a moment ago most of the time that fox

168
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:03,599
tailing a lot of the time that is

169
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,520
genetics it is in the genetics many

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,199
genetics will do that a lot of the more

171
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,959
tropical sativa type stuff will do that

172
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,079
uh most of your Afghans and your indicia

173
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,918
stuff won't do it as much uh but I

174
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,959
believe that is so uh so that that plant

175
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,439
it is hot and tropical and humid where

176
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,719
that plant is being grown and if it got

177
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,399
tight and cluster that inside part would

178
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,319
get moldy so the plant knew that and it

179
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,839
went hey let's spread out a little bit

180
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,360
and it's got all this breathing room so

181
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,478
it doesn't get moldy in the inside of

182
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,479
the plant uh that is my theory that

183
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:33,959
that's what I think Fox tailing is about

184
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,680
it can be exaggerated by room

185
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,318
environment conditions like if it gets

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,360
too hot they will bring on more Fox

187
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,120
tailing if it gets too dry that could

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,240
encourage Fox tailing also if it gets

189
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,280
too humid that could encourage Fox

190
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,439
tailing it's all about uh what happens

191
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,879
in the environment and how that plant is

192
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,399
uh genetically programmed to respond to

193
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,478
that environmental trigger so is

194
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,120
foxtailing a good or bad thing is the

195
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,038
next part of this question um that is a

196
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,800
very relative question if you're growing

197
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,839
for flower if you want a nice uh bag

198
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,598
appe peel if you want the sack like Dr

199
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,758
Dre taught us a long time ago you want a

200
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,878
sack of rocks you want a bag of tight

201
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,240
dense buds that just lines the bottom of

202
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,599
the baggie would be your quarter of

203
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,879
nuggets and that's all that should be in

204
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,478
there some dense tight rocks uh that is

205
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,599
a good mindset if you're rolling blunts

206
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,439
if you're taking bong loads but if you

207
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,719
are a concentrate maker some of these

208
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,839
finger uh fingery foxa buds are more

209
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,560
desirable I've said this before a long

210
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,359
time ago imagine if I were to take my

211
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,879
Fist and I were to roll it around in

212
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
powdered sugar we're going to moisten up

213
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,400
my fist and roll it in powdered sugar

214
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,720
I'm going to get this much surface area

215
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:42,038
worth of powdered sugar uh imagine if

216
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,599
that is tricomes on a plant you got this

217
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:44,598
much Tricom all over here I don't know

218
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,839
the surface area I don't know how to

219
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,079
measure that but this much surface area

220
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,959
covered in tricomes now imagine if we

221
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,959
grew a more open structured Bud a more

222
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,799
foxtail Bud that was like this and had

223
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,598
weird shapes coming out of it look at

224
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,000
all that extra surface area I just

225
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,719
opened up for more troms that if we're

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,918
making concentrates that would be much

227
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,919
easier to extract from the plant that

228
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:09,839
more fingery areer more spacious open

229
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,719
type of a bud is more desirable for a

230
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,758
concentrate maker I do see a trend

231
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,120
starting that the concentrate makers are

232
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,080
realizing that the flower smokers want

233
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,759
that tighter Bud that tighter bud

234
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,959
structure which we all enjoy Which is

235
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,280
popular which we're all accustomed to

236
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,158
there's nothing wrong with it but the

237
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,799
people that are making concentrates that

238
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:28,719
are leaning more toward the phenotypes

239
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,038
that are more open that are more Airy

240
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,839
because like I just talked about there's

241
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:35,559
more uh more uh surface area to get

242
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,200
tricomes on and also if you got this bud

243
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,199
with just this much Tricom in it all

244
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,360
this inside it's hard to wash that it's

245
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,360
hard to extract that this bud is much

246
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,278
easier too however you're pressing it

247
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,440
extracting it washing it blasting it

248
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,320
processing it whatever you do this bud

249
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,839
is easier to knock tricomes off of so

250
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,680
that is a pro and a con of that foxa but

251
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,839
if you're looking for bag appeal if you

252
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,719
want to put it on the Shelf at the

253
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,440
dispensary if you want the crew to buy

254
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,800
it and pay top dollar for it maybe that

255
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,160
fox hilly shit's not for you but if

256
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,479
you're making concentrates that just may

257
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,240
be the perfect strain for you and in the

258
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,120
future I do see a trend in those foxtail

259
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,919
strains getting more popular for the

260
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,720
concentrate makers imagine if you're

261
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,479
running Bubble Bags you got all those

262
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,399
fingers that's so much easier to wash

263
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,480
than a tight bunch of rocks in my

264
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,759
opinion in my experience all right let

265
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,639
me make sure I've covered this question

266
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:27,039
I did ramble quite a long time about

267
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,759
that one um Fox sailing does it happen

268
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,919
yeah it's a thing it really does happen

269
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,919
is there way to avoid it sometimes that

270
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:35,039
fox tailing is genetic sometimes it is

271
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,799
brought on by too much heat uh if you're

272
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,360
getting a lot of excessive Fox tailing

273
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,799
maybe raise your lights get that butt

274
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,240
away from the light that may help you

275
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,919
out maybe cool off the room is there a

276
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,079
need for it yeah the concentrate makers

277
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,039
like it uh extra labor when it comes to

278
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:48,958
trimming yeah if you're making

279
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,399
concentrates you don't have to trim it

280
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,278
so that makes it so much easier uh this

281
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,000
is all about phenotypical selection

282
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,958
maybe pick the one that is not so

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,240
fingery oh excuse me my voice is burning

284
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,239
out right there I apologize for that

285
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,278
that one but my friend Stefan uh thank

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,440
let's keep the podcast moving I do have

302
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,720
another great question here in front of

303
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,320
me this one came from our friend Blue

304
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,600
Grass ganja what's up Bluegrass ganja I

305
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,399
do like that name it says hey rosta Jeff

306
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,399
I have recently popped several tester

307
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,200
packs from another breeder I have been

308
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,600
noticing on one of the seedlings that it

309
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,680
is showing variegation and that is when

310
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,079
you see um just different like it'll

311
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,039
probably be dark green and you'll see

312
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,719
some light green color ing uh maybe

313
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,319
tiger stripes maybe Stripes going up the

314
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,480
length or the width of the plant of the

315
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,760
leaves there uh that is basic

316
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,240
variegation uh maybe an albino looking

317
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,919
leaf or something on there or a half

318
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,278
albino leaf that is basic variegation it

319
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,240
says would you be concerned and what are

320
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,720
the possible outcomes from finishing

321
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,600
this plant thanks always I do appreciate

322
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,560
the knowledge this is a great question

323
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,200
it is not uncommon to see some weird

324
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:27,239
things in little tiny plants in

325
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,160
seedlings that are brand new a lot of

326
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,759
the time the plant will simply grow out

327
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,879
of that the variegation it may grow out

328
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,919
of it uh weird mutations when the plants

329
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,439
are little it may grow out of it it may

330
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,958
not it may continue um if it doesn't

331
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,480
then you've got a really unique plant

332
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,278
that I would flower out I would keep a

333
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,159
clone of it and I would see what it does

334
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:46,360
if it's super fire and it grows good and

335
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,000
smokes good uh gets you good and Buzz

336
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,839
has a nice flavor to it and it makes

337
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,360
some cool variegation that may be

338
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,360
something fun to play with I would keep

339
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,320
an eye on it make sure it doesn't do

340
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,320
anything super weird but I would just

341
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,000
keep growing it treat it like normal but

342
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,959
keep an eye on it if it starts doing

343
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,078
weird [ __ ] then make some decisions uh

344
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,518
message me back but your options right

345
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:06,120
now are that it's going to grow out of

346
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,799
that by the time it's a foot tall you'll

347
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,959
never even remember that it had a

348
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,559
variegation or it's going to stay just

349
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,078
like it was or it will uh exaggerate the

350
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,198
variegation at which point I would make

351
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,919
some decisions uh look at the plant send

352
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:19,240
me a picture at that point then we can

353
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,679
make some decisions but at this Little

354
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,000
Seedling stage uh it's very likely that

355
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,078
it will grow out of that but some of my

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,679
plants some of my favorite plants are

357
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,239
the weirdos That Grew From a pack of

358
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,039
seeds uh the weird The Misfits the runs

359
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
that most of you would have thrown away

360
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,198
those might be some of the best plants

361
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,480
in the pack sometimes if you think about

362
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:38,559
it they're doing weird [ __ ] uh maybe

363
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,399
they're just going to bang out a whole

364
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,518
bunch of THC as another weird trait you

365
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,639
never know what those weirdos could do

366
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,078
sometimes give them a chance so that was

367
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,839
a quick answer uh my friend Blue Grass

safely but once again my dude Bluegrass

383
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,480

do appreciate it I do look forward to

385
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,600
the followup let me know what happens

386
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,639
with this plant uh if it gets crazier if

387
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,159
it grows right on out of it uh if you

388
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,120
decide to call it if you decide to keep

389
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,639
it going if you decide to breed with it

390
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,480
let me know because I'm very curious

391
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,000
about your variegated plan all right

392
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,480
let's keep this party moving I do have

393
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,639
another great question here in front of

394
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,720
me this one came from our friend tokom

395
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,680
MAAC shout out to our friend tokomak hey

396
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,399

397
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,078
because you want a free pack of iy

398
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,559
genetics premium seeds tokomak has a

399
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,679
question and it goes just like this my

400
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,078
question is a breeding question about

401
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:56,198
s1's all right let's talk about S1

402
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:58,000
before we get too far what is an S1

403
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,278
let's just say that you've got a Golden

404
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,198
Goat female plant you take that Golden

405
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:04,639
Goat you cut two clones of the same

406
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:06,758
plant that Golden Goat and Golden Goat

407
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,839
we're going to treat one plant with a

408
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,680
solution it is called Silver tho sulfate

409
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,279
that solution will cause this plant to

410
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,799
create pollen that pollen will be put on

411
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,399
the other clone now we have just made

412
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,958
Golden Goat S1 seeds those seeds will be

413
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,039
all female all Golden Goat seeds because

414
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,278
we used a Golden Goat female and a

415
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:29,719
Golden Goat female we bred them together

416
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:32,000
that is all Golden Goat S1 it is self s

417
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,079
stands for self one is the first

418
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,278
generation this is the first generation

419
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,278
of selfed Golden Goat seeds we're just

420
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,278
using the Golden Goat as an example here

421
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,679
because that makes it easy we're going

422
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:44,838
to move forward with the question it

423
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,919
says when Crossing an S1 with a male of

424
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,160
a different cultivar and hunting the

425
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,399
results to find a keeper female what

426
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:54,838
would be the purpose of back crossing

427
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:57,120
the keeper to the original S1 that is a

428
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,040
very good question let's talk more about

429
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,600
that so to explain this I'm I'm going to

430
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,000
stick with the Golden Goat Theory

431
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,120
because I've kind of done this with

432
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,480
Golden Goat and I can explain how and

433
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,320
why and what my purpose was and what the

434
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,240
uh the purpose could be of this so you

435
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,360
want to take a Golden Goat S1 and you

436
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,759
want to pollinate that with a different

437
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,360
cavar now I didn't do exactly this with

438
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,039
the Golden Goat let me make a disclaimer

439
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,320
when I did this I used the original

440
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:23,799
Golden Goat clone because I have that

441
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,560
most people don't have that original

442
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,838
Golden Goat clone they've got the S1

443
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,198
seed and this example he's asking about

444
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,920
the S1 seed so for the story we're going

445
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:34,838
to change my Golden Goat to the S1 but

446
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:36,838
for history sake I've got the original

447
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,240
Golden Goat clone don't get it twisted

448
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,560
don't change history don't think I'm

449
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,680
saying something different than ever

450
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:44,159
before uh we're just changing the story

451
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:47,000
to for this podcast uh we're going to

452
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,879
start with the Golden Goat S1 seed and

453
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,799
then when uh we going to cross the

454
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,519
Golden Goat S1 with a maale of a

455
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,039
different cultivar we're going to use uh

456
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,799
the daybreaker because hypothetically

457
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,799
realistically that's kind of what I did

458
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,000
I took Golden Goat daybreaker I

459
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,159
pollinated so then I took that male of a

460
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,839
different cultivar like in this question

461
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:09,078
and I pollinated that S1 in the real

462
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,480
world I did the Clone only like I keep

463
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:12,638
saying I want to make that disclaimer

464
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,159
but for this story took the daybreaker

465
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,399
mail pollinated that S1 Golden Goat that

466
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:22,679
would have made arise for this story now

467
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,679
also out of that arise did come a very

468
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,399
good a couple of male plants the one

469
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,159
male known as King Solomon but also

470
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,519
there's the Lesser known male that is

471
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,958
the Golden Goat dominant male of the

472
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,278
arise batch that is the one that I used

473
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,318
to make the Golden Goat backcross seeds

474
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,759
so now let's talk about uh what would be

475
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:43,159
the purpose of back crossing the keeper

476
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,639
to the original S1 now what I'm talking

477
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:46,318
about here is going to be a little bit

478
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,000
different then we'll touch on what the

479
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:50,919
actual question is um the thing that I

480
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,198
did was I found a male this uh question

481
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:55,879
is asking about finding a female I found

482
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,198
a male um because we took a male plant

483
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:00,399
and pollinated a fem seed that made male

484
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:01,919
and female plants out of that so I found

485
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,958
a male that really spoke to me that

486
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,078
looked just like the Golden Goat and my

487
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,720
purpose for back Crossing that was

488
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,119
because I wanted to stabilize those

489
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,838
Golden Goat traits uh and make Golden

490
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,879
Goat seeds there are no pure Golden Goat

491
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,279
regular seeds and a lot of purists do

492
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,039
not want to buy the feminized version uh

493
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,318
some people are just not into feminized

494
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,720
seeds there's an array of reasons why uh

495
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:24,798
we're not going to talk about that now

496
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,720
but some people don't want to buy fem a

497
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,119
lot of people want original Golden Goat

498
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,679
bat cross seeds so I took the Golden

499
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,479
Goat I pollinated it with daybreaker I

500
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,559
have now got seeds that are half golden

501
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,200
goat half daybreaker because parents

502
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:39,678
were 50/50 one of one uh one of one on

503
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,840
one side one on the other it came out

504
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,160
50/50 I searched for a phenotype a male

505
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,839
that looked a lot like the Golden Goat

506
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,080
if any of the phenotypes look like the

507
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,720
daybreaker I eliminated those for this

508
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,918
project because I don't want daybreaker

509
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,519
traits in this cross my next step if I

510
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,440
want Golden Goat uh if I want Golden

511
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,000
Goat backat cross seeds I need to

512
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,200
essentially wash out all of the

513
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,240
daybreaker traits so I'm looking for a

514
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,480
male that does not look like daybreaker

515
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,960
at all I need a boy that looks exactly

516
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,079
like Golden Goat so I found that dude

517
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,360
then I took that dude and I pollinated

518
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,199
the original uh mine was like I said the

519
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,359
original Golden Goat clone but for this

520
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,600
story I would pollinate that original S1

521
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,479
the purpose for that is now I'm washing

522
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,558
out some of those daybreaker trads

523
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,759
because now it's more of a two to one

524
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,960
mix of that Golden Goat Golden Goat

525
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,558
daybreaker combination cuz I kind of

526
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,000
washed out some of that daybreaker by

527
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:36,399
breeding it back to the Golden Goat I

528
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,798
got really lucky or maybe I did really

529
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,280
good uh thinking and planning I was very

530
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,000
meticulous in my selection uh I was

531
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,879
taking leaves off of my Golden Goat

532
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,279
female and leaves off of my potential

533
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,200
Golden Goat male candidates and matching

534
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,558
them up to see if Le Leaf shape and size

535
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,200
and serration were even I was rubbing

536
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,000
one with one hand and one with the other

537
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,919
and making sure the smells were the same

538
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,079
throughout the flowering phase I was

539
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,400
very meticulous with selecting my Golden

540
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,918
Goat uh my uh it's an arise Golden Goat

541
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,240
dominant uh looking phenotype of arise

542
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,400
male I was very specific in selecting

543
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,440
that one so most of my phenotypes in my

544
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,759
Golden Goat backat cross come out very

545
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,759
very Golden Goat dominant the batross 2

546
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,919
so if I did it again if I grew those

547
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,480
batross one seeds and found a mail plant

548
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,640
out of that and put that back on the

549
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,319
Golden Goat again it would really lock

550
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,360
in those Golden Goat traits most of

551
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,798
those seeds would be Golden Goat uh just

552
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,599
straight Golden Goat coming out when

553
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:34,000
they grew so the purpose for my reason

554
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,199
for going backwards was to wash out the

555
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,359
daybreaker traits and lock in the Golden

556
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,319
Goat traits I was removing the plant

557
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:42,519
that I used to adulterate it to initiate

558
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,359
the backat cross process because at the

559
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:46,519
time there was no Golden Goat mail there

560
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,759
still is no Golden Goat male but people

561
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,200
want those pure Golden Goat non- femin

562
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:54,279
seeds the closest I can get is a backat

563
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,319
cross or a backat cross 2 version so

564
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:57,759
that is one reason I talked about why I

565
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,839
chose the male that's for the backat

566
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:03,038
cross to lock in traits you are saying

567
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,678
uh what if I were to back cross the

568
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,279
keeper to the original S1 so you're

569
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,480
going to find a female keeper out of

570
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,079
here and cross it to the original S1 it

571
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,079
would essentially do the same thing it

572
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,720
would lock in whatever traits you have

573
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,599
found it would really lock in those

574
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,798
traits to where probably 70 to 80% of

575
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,519
the seeds you grew would look just like

576
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,319
the original plant that you've started

577
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,879
with if you did your selections properly

578
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,759
so if I read that correctly you want to

579
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,760
take your S1 you want to pollinate it

580
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,558
you want to make seeds that all makes

581
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,519
sense so far you still got the S1 over

582
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,000
here that's our marker uh then you want

583
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,480
to find good a good female out of that

584
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,720
then which one are we going to reverse

585
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,000
are we going to reverse the new female

586
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,640
let's see what would be the purpose of

587
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,960
back crossing the original to the

588
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,320
original or the new one to the original

589
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,120
uh which one do we want to reverse you

590
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,798
could do either one but either way you

591
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:51,038
do it I would reverse uh the original

592
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:52,400
and put it on the new one I would do

593
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,400
both honestly I'd [ __ ] around and do

594
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,480
both over time but at that point you're

595
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
just walking in uh if you find that

596
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,919
keeper and then you find that golden go

597
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,918
you're just putting in the or that

598
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,880
original S1 you're just locking in those

599
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,880
traits uh hopefully you selected the one

600
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,240
you really love and then you can lock in

601
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,200
those traits in the next breeding

602
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,319
project uh that would be the purpose is

603
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,558
to lock in traits you're not going to

604
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,200
open anything up you're not going to

605
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,079
create anything new uh you may see some

606
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,278
um transgressive segregation or some

607
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,319
weird recessive traits but the main

608
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,440
purpose would be to lock in dominant

609
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:25,038
traits which you have identified and now

610
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,360
that we're talking about it this is sort

611
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:31,000
of uh kind of what I did with the

612
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,719
Grateful do and number 77 kind of on

613
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,880
accident without even realizing what I

614
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,200
was doing but that is another story for

615
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,600
another time uh somebody remind me cuz

616
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,679
I'm not going to write it down to do an

617
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,879
episode about number 77 and the Grateful

618
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,840
Dog and we'll talk more in depth about

619
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,600
that in the future that's a whole other

620
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:51,158
podcast all right my dude uh tacomac I

621
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,839
think I've answered your question here I

622
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,400
did a lot of rambling about this and I'm

623
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:56,720
not even sure that I got you a solid

624
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,600
answer I think it makes sense uh breeder

625
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,278
to breeder I think you'll understand all

626
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,519
the stuff that I was saying all right my

627
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,079
dude make sure you do send me your

628
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,679
shipping address because I owe you a

629
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:07,119
free pack of iy genetics premium seeds

630
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,880
and I look forward to seeing what you do

631
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,119
with those since you are a breeder

632
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,200
somebody's starting thinking about

633
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:14,359
breeding I do encourage you and give you

634
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,200
my blessings and permission to breed

635
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,599
with any seeds that you receive from me

636
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,038
if you get I gentics premium seeds

637
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,319
regular feminized seeds uh any seeds

638
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,000
that come from me you do have my

639
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,519
permission and blessings to breed with

640
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,240
them if you got them in a uh a positive

641
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,038
way if you stole them or scam someone or

642
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,480
rip them off uh throw them away you

643
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,839
don't deserve them but if you got them

644
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,839
in a positive uh what is it an ethical

645
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:38,959
way grow the [ __ ] out of those breed

646
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,439
them produce some quality seeds as long

647
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,960
as you give me credit on the breeding

648
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,038
package or when you put them out or when

649
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,278
