free grow lessons in Cannabis News

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,120
something funny that happened we did

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,360
that episode at the hookah bar and I

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,599
left a few of those there on the table

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,159
and the police have been going to that

102
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,000
hookah bar randomly trying to bust

103
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,120
people smoking weed there and it's not

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
happening but the only thing they found

105
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,519
are these Agro culture podcast Flyers

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,920
with a weed leaf on there and they

107
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,560
insist that that is some sort of code to

108
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,759
like get weed or something somewhere and

109
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,840
it's not guys if you uh if you took the

110
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,238
time to scan the QR code that is on that

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,560
flyer it brought you to this podcast oh

112
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,039
God sorry I'm coughing because I took a

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,199
dab in the privacy of my own home like

114
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,439
I'm allowed to do as a Colorado resident

115
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,520
but if the cops are listening to this

116
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,719
show that QR code worked the flyer did

117
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,079
exactly what it was supposed to do it

118
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,120
was an ad to get people to listen to the

119
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,959
podcast so I think it's really hilarious

120
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,280
they thought a little it's just a flyer

121
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,599
that says to listen to a show they

122
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,478
thought that was some sort of code to

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,840
get you some free weed that's really

124
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,918
funny uh inaccurate guys great police

125
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,198

126
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,599

call him so I said I saw ashar and I

158

exist they they deemed the water hash

167
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,120
that we were making unfit for human

168
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,840
consumption even though nobody has

169
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,399
gotten sick from our hash the Department

170
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,560
of Environmental Health verified that

171
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,000
there haven't been any reports of

172
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,120
illness yet but a food safety inspection

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,959
was the reason for the recall ashar has

174
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,598
been using a modified washing machine to

175
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,598
activate his water hash a common

176
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:21,560
practice in this industry to get the

177
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,918
centrifugal action that is essential to

178
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,759
the water hash said ashar also known for

179
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,399
his popular marijuana meet and greets in

180
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,759
Denver Colorado uh dude AJ throws some

181
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,359
great parties he hasn't been able to do

182
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,720
them anymore because the uh Denver

183
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,038
Police have actually been shutting those

184
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,880
parties down uh because we're smoking

185
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,279
cannabis and not drinking

186
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,120
alcohol anyway the article says my

187
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,000
business partner and I both have

188
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,519
culinary backgrounds Food Service

189
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,478
backgrounds and we look at water hashes

190
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,079
a concentrate not a food ashar said but

191
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:52,000
they say as soon as you start working

192
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:54,800
with it uh with a food as the intent or

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,038
the end result it is food which I kind

194
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,680
of agree with that you know it's got to

195
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:59,079
be food we're going to eat that hash

196
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,160
that's the active ingredient that we're

197
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,159
searching for so it's got to be clean

198
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,919
it's got to be food grade uh in June

199
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,639
ashar received a variance from the state

200
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,279
through September uh to find a food safe

201
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,160
alternative and he purchased a bubble

202
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,279
Magic Machine he hopes will satisfy

203
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,919
their regulations in the meantime the

204
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,318
state demanded that he recall all

205
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:18,918

225
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,319
Environmental Health is saying that any

226
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,918

227
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,120
be removed from the retail shelves and

228
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,279

234
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,439
above

235
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,120

237
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,519
want to give a big shout out to AJ he's

238
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,840

00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,719
community he actually threw those meet

240
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,878
and greets like they were talking about

241
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,200
if you go to an event in Colorado AJ's

242
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,519
got a booth there they're giving out

sticks they're giving out free samples

244
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,719

245
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,278
does get his products back on the Shelf

246
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919

00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:45,480
to send them over to Steep Hill halent

248

go buy those if it's a good product

252

knows their advertising dollars are

282
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,160
going the right direction all right

283
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,879
let's get down to a grow lesson a few

284
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,199
weeks ago uh we cut some clones we

285
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,200
germinated seeds and then we put those

286
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,680
seedlings and clones into cups uh to let

287
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,879
them develop Roots so it's probably on

288
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:05,719
the time schedule I've been on it's

289
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,159
probably Pas time to get those into pots

290
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,320
and start the vegetative phase so uh I

291
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,799
apologize if I'm a little behind

292
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,278
schedule I've had a lot of podcasting to

293
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,958
try to cram in anyway let's talk about

294
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:17,278
the size pots we're going to use I like

295
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,599
to go straight into the pots that I'm

296
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,000
going to finish in like the p uh the

297
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,399
what I transplant into now from the cups

298
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,240
is going to be our finish pot so we were

299
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,159
in

300
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,799
cups uh we're going to go into pots

301
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,319
choosing your pot size is important is

302
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,240
an important thing to consider I like to

303
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,000
run my test plants in three gallon pots

304
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,200
and my big plants in seven gallon pots

305
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,639
uh some of you guys like to go even

306
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,480
bigger but for an indoor crop I think a

307
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,240
s gallon pot is plenty large enough if

308
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,399
you're going outside uh [ __ ] you can go

309
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,399
50 to 100 or I've seen 250 gallon pots

310
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,519
outside Earth pots but if you're going

311
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,799
that big you should just go into the

312
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,759
ground I think anyway I think I'm

313
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,439
rambling uh 3 to five gallon pots are

314
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,879
great for vegging plants for a few weeks

315
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,000
and then flowering I don't like to let

316
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,919
them veg in 3 gallon pots for longer

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,440
than like 45 days or so

318
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,479
once the plants start to get too big for

319
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,120
that they'll get a little bit root bound

320
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,079
so if you want to V your plants for more

321
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,360
time to get bigger uh plants and bigger

322
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:13,359
buds use larger pots uh if I want to run

323
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,560
a fast crop I run about 16 3 gallon pots

324
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,039
under 1,000 watt light uh these are

325
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,119
usually from seed if I'm running like a

326
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,679
little tester crop is what I do that for

327
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,399
if I'm running a production crop I'll

328
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,000
put uh between four and six s gallon

329
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,159
pots under 1,000 watt light depending on

330
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,360
the strain uh if they get taller and

331
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,120
thinner I'll put uh six of them if

332
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,039
they're like bushier plants like I'll

333
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,799
say The Grateful Dog I'll only put four

334
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:38,719
lemon Jeffrey I'll put six uh just kind

335
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,199
of cuz the lemon Jeffree gets taller

336
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,240
than it does wide so I'll put six of

337
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,519
them under there and uh pull a pretty

338
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,159
nice Harvest about a pound and a half

339
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,959
from six lemon Jeffrey plants and seven

340
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:50,199
gallon pots under 1,000 watt light uh of

341
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,278
course I can

342
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,000
get I can get that pound and a half from

343
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,958
four of them but I have to let it veg

344
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,078
just a little bit longer maybe like two

345
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,399
weeks more and then the but that's just

346
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,199
that that's the difference in the pot

347
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,519
size and the veg times and how many plts

348
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,839
that's where you start doing that kind

349
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,600
of math but uh both of these methods

350
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,480
will harvest me about a pound pound and

351
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,839
a half if done correctly the smaller

352
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,600
plants take less time to veg but I like

353
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,720
the production from a seven gallon pot

354
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,480
they're a little bit bigger they seem

355
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,759
like they're able to grow more when they

356
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,480
have a bigger root ball they just seem

357
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,639
to take off they uh they grow larger in

358
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,560
flour they seem like they keep growing a

359
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,120
little bit taller they don't cut off as

360
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,719
early in their growth phase in flow so

361
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,078
uh we're also limited by plant count so

362
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,959
if few were larger pots is better for

363
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,919
the medical Growers if you have a small

364
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,000
grow space of course use smaller Pots if

365
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,719
you have room for larger pots go for the

366
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,320
larger pots you can experiment and see

367
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,320
what and why and how it all works best

368
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,920
for your needs and your environment how

369
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,959
much herb you need uh how often you need

370
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,319
it what strains are going to grow those

371
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,198
are all things that are going to kind of

372
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,560
decide this stuff for

373
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,278
you excuse my dab cough I like to take a

374
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,439
lot of dabs when I record a podcast Adam

375
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:57,679
was here watching me record and he's

376
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,560
like dude how do you even record with

377
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,879
that many dabs going on I recorded some

378
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,039
stuff with him I'll make another episode

379
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,879
out of that we got a little out of hand

380
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:05,879
and just started rambling so anyway I'm

381
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:07,679
doing that again here we go uh once

382
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,439
you've chosen your pot size it's time

383
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,919
for good soil I like a nice fluffy soil

384
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,560
uh with lots of perite in it I had

385
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,399
plenty of amendments so I buy a fairly

386
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,000
inert soil uh if you have access to a

387
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,039
good grow supply store then I recommend

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,679
starting with something like Roots

389
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,078
organic Sunshine mix number four

390
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:24,879
something similar to that these are all

391
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,519
great starters I use a recycled and a

392
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,759
mided soil mix that can get a little

393
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,078
complex and it can make it hard to

394
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,720
diagnose problems if one comes up so I

395
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,519
recommend learning with the basic soil

396
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,360
and organic bottled nutrients unless you

397
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,000
have experience with farming horiculture

398
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,919
composting or some kind of soil or plant

399
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,559
education uh once you understand the

400
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,120
basics of the plants we can make a super

401
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,078
soil mix and work on eliminating the

402
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,639
bottle feeds but for now let's keep it

403
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:48,278
simple and develop a good understanding

404
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,399
of these plants that's where we want to

405
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,679
start uh so you've got some soil you got

406
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,120
some pots now you've got some small

407
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,399
plants that are in cups let's get those

408
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,159
babies uh into the big girl pots and

409
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,759
then we'll talk about feeding for the

410
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,198
vegetation phase

411
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,199
so having the little babies in cups is

412
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,679
really going to help out and make it

413
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:06,120
easy to transplant I fill my pots with

414
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,559
soil and I pack it in there slightly

415
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,959
tight I just press it down with my hands

416
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,078
and I don't pack it so tightly that The

417
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,439
Roots can't dig through but I do want to

418
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:13,719
pack it tightly enough to where the

419
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,000
plant's going to have plenty of support

420
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,440
once I bury that root ball in there uh

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,559
if the soil's packed too lightly you'll

422
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,600
know because as soon as you water uh the

423
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,039
water's just going to run right through

424
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,399
the dirt and the soil's going to cave in

425
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:25,599
and then you'll have to refill in there

426
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,600
but anyway uh fill your pots about 2 in

427
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,680
from the top or more for bigger pots we

428
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,560
want to save some space for watering

429
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,239
a 7 gallon pot will take a gallon of

430
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,119
water or more and that needs some space

431
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,680
in your pot and a three gallon pot

432
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,000
you'll easily take half a gallon up to a

433
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,479
gallon so save yourself some space so I

434
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,720
get the pot mostly full and then I dig

435
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,839
out uh about a large handful of soil out

436
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,399
of the center of the pot uh I set the

437
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,959
Clone in the cup it's still in the

438
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,559
plastic cup right now for a minute I set

439
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,599
that cup in the spot where the Clone is

440
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,518
going to go and I back fill the dirt

441
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,040
around the cup this makes a perfect

442
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,639
little spot for the Clone to fit without

443
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,439
disturbing The Roots uh but I don't

444
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,399
leave the cup okay I want to stress that

445
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,160
I do not leave the cup on the Clone only

446
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,360
for that one second while I was making

447
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,679
an indention I don't leave the cup I

448
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,240
only uh I only use it to make a little

449
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,039
space for the Clone once I've got the

450
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,639
perfect little space in there made for

451
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:16,559
my clone uh I pull that cup out with the

452
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,240
Clone in it and then I hold the cup

453
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,078
upside down uh with my hand on top of

454
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,120
the cup with the Clone coming out like

455
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,039
between my middle and ring finger and I

456
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,560
flip the cup upside

457
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,399
down excuse me sorry I flip it upside

458
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,518
down I give it a little squeeze and then

459
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,399
uh usually you can just squeeze it and

460
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,600
shake it until the Clone uh slides out

461
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,639
of the cup and then try not to uh try

462
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,920
not to disturb the roots and that soil

463
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,919
ball that come right out of there just

464
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:43,439
shake it and it'll come out and set that

465
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,078
little soil ball perfectly uh into that

466
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,519
perfect little spot that we just made it

467
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:49,318
should be the same shape as the cup

468
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,720
since you just make it so just set it

469
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,838
right down in there when the C cup comes

470
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,399
off there'll be dirt falling out uh

471
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,839
it'll seem chaotic and messy but just

472
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,000
stay calm you can drop dirt and [ __ ]

473
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,880
just don't drop the plant just focus on

474
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
getting that tiny little root ball into

475
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,720
that hole that we just made and

476
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,039
everything should be just fine so now

477
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,680
you've taken your cup you flipped it

478
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:09,318
upside down that little baby plant's

479
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,958
falling out you got a handful of dirt

480
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,759
you're holding your new [ __ ] life

481
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,919
right there in your hand you set it in

482
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,919
that like remember that little toy you

483
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,399
used to have when you were a kid you had

484
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,919
to put the little peg into the hole

485
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,000
thing so what you want to do Bo just set

486
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,198
it right in there and now uh you got to

487
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,799
get some dirt and put it over the top of

488
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,838
that I just get it like a small handful

489
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,439
of soil and I drop it over the top of

490
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,759
the whole plant like right where not the

491
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,399
whole plant but all the soil right where

492
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,039
I just put the new freshly planted plant

493
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,559
and uh all around the rest to kind of

494
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,879
level it out so that you just kind of

495
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,239
camouflage the where the spot was you

496
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,078
kind of just want to blend it in you

497
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,159
want all that to become one

498
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,239
spot now I press it down just tightly

499
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:47,318
enough to hold the plant upright and

500
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,000
carefully label your newly potted plant

501
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:51,479
label it it sucks having a plant that's

502
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,159
not labeled uh if the cup was well

503
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,759
labeled uh also leave that cup in there

504
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,318
so that way if your label comes off the

505
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,240
cup is still in there sometimes that

506
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:00,719
helps I sometimes I just use the cup but

507
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,159
once in a while I knock the cup out and

508
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,720
they get confused so that sucks so once

509
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,359
I've got that potted I set it under the

510
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
light and I keep working until all of my

511
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,078
new babies are in pots once everything

512
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,000
is potted is when I'll feed them and

513
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,198
make sure to get the pots thoroughly wet

514
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,199
so you've got a crop of freshly

515
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,600
transplanted planted babies under the

516
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,600
lights uh and now that's pretty much the

517
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,240
beginning of the vegetative growth phase

518
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,639
it's time to mix up some nutrients and

519
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,359
feed them their uh First full veg

520
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,880
nutrients I'm a soil grower so uh I

521
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,359
pretty much focus on a dirt Garden if

522
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,240
you're running a Hydro Garden we're

523
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,519
going to have to get a hydro go Hydro

524
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,079
guy on the show here in the future and

525
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,359
have him teach you guys some stuff uh

526
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,159
let's feed our new babies uh if you're a

527
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,719
new grower I recommend mixing your

528
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,200
nutrients in a 5 gallon bucket uh use an

529
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,679
accurate measuring device for your

530
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,400
nutrients I use the shot glass that has

531
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,880
milliliters and stuff marked on it for

532
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,600
small applications for larger stuff

533
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,400
there's a pint glass that is marked with

534
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,439
milliliters and a few other measurements

535
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,720
uh you can find those at your local

536
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,480
Hydro shop I found a half gallon pitcher

537
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,759
that fits perfectly into my 5 gallon

538
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,319
bucket I've learned to my learned to mix

539
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:09,119
my nutrients into that pitcher and add

540
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,079
that to the bucket instead of mixing my

541
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,359
nutrients directly into a 5 gallon

542
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,079
bucket uh you don't want to pour out

543
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,798
five gallons of water when you mess up

544
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,480
mixing your nutrient feed that's a lot

545
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,558
of water to pour down the drain so fill

546
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,558
your pitcher 3/4 of the way with water

547
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,519
add your nutrients of choice to the

548
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:27,399
pitcher uh I would use a good base

549
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,319
nutrient a good rud inoculant and some

550
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,720
good enzymes specific specifically I

551
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:35,079
would use 50 mL of botanic hair pure

552
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,400
blend Pro veg soil formula as my base I

553
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,639
would use ogt or great white shark as my

554
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,080
MOS which is your inoculant and I would

555
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,480
use 15 mL of hydrozyme as my

556
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,879
enzymes uh so in my garden I would add a

557
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,679
little bit of liquid Karma and a few

558
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,880
other supplements but they're not

559
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,440
required uh I add sweet to feed my

560
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,039
beneficials uh I add vitamino for extra

561
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,240
vitamins and and amino acids and vitamin

562
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,720
B also and uh what else to add in there

563
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,000
it seems like I added something else but

564
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,200
uh if you're not looking to spend if

565
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,759
you're not looking to spend the extra

566
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,759
bucks those aren't required but I like

567
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:09,599
to spoil my plants uh after about a week

568
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll or during the next week I'll feed

569
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,158
calmag and potassium silicates and then

570
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,319
I run most of the botanic here botanic

571
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,440
hair pure blend Pro Line when I run

572
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,079
bottled nutrients B Botanicare is not a

573
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,159
sponsor but I've been most satisfied

574
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:25,319
with uh botanic hair and organic hair

575
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,440
more than any other bottle feed that's

576
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,519
that's just my opinion I ran Advanced

577
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,120
Nutrients I've ran the Aurora Soul

578
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,679
synthetics which produced some super

579
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:38,719
tasty products uh I ran psycho which was

580
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,320
probably uh not my favorite um yeah I've

581
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,079
ran a bunch of them I've ran the Fox

582
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,359
Farms basic stuff I've done a lot of

583
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,879
feeds I've done so many I can't even

584
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,678
remember them all anyway uh you can find

585
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,559
a pretty good pre-made Botanicare feed

586
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,200
chart on their website I'll try to

587
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,558
remember to post some of my notes on the

588
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,600
feeding programs feeding programs for

589
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,158
that somebody tweet me and remind me at

590
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:00,240
igro culture I've got this paper here in

591
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,240
front of me so hopefully that'll remind

592
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,759
me uh let's get back on focus a little

593
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,359
bit and talk about mixing stuff

594
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:10,200
up uh mix up your bottled feeds in a

595
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,079
small container of water but don't ever

596
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,440
mix your nutrients together without

597
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:17,439
plenty of water don't pour like a shot

598
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,000
glass the measuring device don't pour

599
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,840
the veg stuff and then don't pour

600
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,440
enzymes into the same shot glass at the

601
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,000
same time mix those to water uh the

602
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,798
bottled stuff is sold in separate

603
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,960
bottles to prevent bonding of specific

604
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,519
elements so always mix into water once

605
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,120
your pitcher is mixed put that into the

606
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,480
5 gallon bucket and fill it up the rest

607
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,079
of the way uh once the bucket's full you

608
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,038
need to adjust the pH of your feed

609
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:43,038
solution adjust your pH to 6.5 using PH

610
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,359
down it's unlikely that your pH is too

611
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,919
low and make sure you calibrate your uh

612
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,879
PH meters frequently that's always a

613
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,520
good idea so you got a bucket full of

614
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,080
nutrient solution that has been pH

615
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,119
adjusted to 6.5 uh we've got our freshly

616
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,798
transplanted babies under a light the

617
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,798
next thing we got to do is pour the feed

618
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,480
into the plants so uh oh I hope you've

619
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:03,798
got a uh some type of saucer or

620
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
something under to catch the runoff

621
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,798
under your plants also like set your

622
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,840
plants in a saucer or a tray uh if you

623
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,558
don't have something like that uh

624
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,000
sometimes I use a I've got a rubber made

625
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:15,480
tray that'll fit three three gallon pots

626
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,119
in there perfectly so I can just pour

627
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,000
water into the plants and then it'll

628
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,759
drain right into there if not you're

629
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,759
going to end up with water on the floor

630
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,558
so you need something to catch the

631
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,200
runoff that comes out of your plants so

632
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:26,759
I kind of use the pitcher that I'm using

633
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,000
to stir up the solution before I go

634
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,440
right to the plants and try to mix up

635
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,558
the water a little bit to stir up the

636
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,400
stuff it's always a good idea to stir

637
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:35,599
everything thoroughly uh sometimes if

638
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,840
I'm using a big batch sometimes I mix my

639
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,399
nutrients into a much larger batch I

640
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,759
throw an AirStone in there to pump it up

641
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,200
a little bit to air rate it and then

642
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,599
while it's doing that I also use a big

643
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,240
stick like the kind that you'd use to

644
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,678
support your plants I use that to stir

645
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,000
the water up uh it just seems to be

646
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,600
effective I like stirring it it's a good

647
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,240
idea so uh mix it up a little bit then

648
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,639
simply pour about a third of a gallon of

649
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,000
water of the feed into each plant uh if

650
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,240
you're using larger pots you're going to

651
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,960
need more you know if the soil settles

652
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,278
uh then you need to add more water

653
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,240
you'll notice pretty quickly if it like

654
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:06,679
crumbles down in uh once we add the

655
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,319
water all the air space is going to get

656
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,440
pushed out and it's going to yeah the

657
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,639
dirt's going to move around you may have

658
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,120
to adjust some of your plants and some

659
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,440
of the soil so uh water everything and

660
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,599
refill any pots that you need to fill

661
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,720
with soil and get the plants under good

662
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,558
lights T5 lights are good for veg if you

663
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,400
have enough of them close to the plants

664
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,720
metal halides are also ideal for veg

665
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,519
growth we want to focus on getting those

666
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,278
pots full of roots right now so the blue

667
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,918
spectrum is kind of what we want LEDs

668
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:32,319
seem to be really good for veg plants

669
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:33,919
but I personally don't have any

670
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,079
experience with the LEDs but I have seen

671
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,960
some great photographs coming from an

672
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,319
LED Garden shout out to Nancy budwell

673
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,278
she's growing some Bounty Killer right

674
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:44,000
now and it looks

675
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:47,599
amazing so uh try to keep your veg area

676
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
around 72 to 77° if you're using CO2 you

677
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,319
can get it let it get a little bit

678
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,839
warmer uh maybe low 80s during the light

679
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:56,240
period during your dark cycle try to

680
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:59,199
keep them about the same temp or no more

681
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,880
no more than 10° cooler than daytime

682
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,840
temperatures uh try to keep your

683
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,159
humidity around 40 to 55% if possible uh

684
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,720
in Colorado it gets hard to keep the

685
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,278
rooms humid so they get dry here uh

686
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,558
honestly you'd rather have it too dry

687
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:13,798
than too humid if you have the option uh

688
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,558
if you can't get it right where you want

689
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:17,038
it if you're blowers are messed up and

690
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:18,480
not the way you need them to be if you

691
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:19,960
can't correct it I understand you're

692
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,400
growing in a house it's not going to be

693
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,360
perfect you'd rather have it too dry

694
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,759
than too moist if you've got the option

695
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,278
so also remember to keep your air fresh

696
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,440
uh you don't want stale stuffy air in

697
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:32,400
your Grow rooms your plants need plenty

698
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,120
of CO2 and they deplete the CO2 in a

699
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,120
room very quickly uh having stale air in

700
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,879
a grow room can lead to powdery mildew

701
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,639
and it slows down the growth of your

702
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,480
plants quite quickly so I keep my

703
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,200
vegging plants under 24 hours a light I

704
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,400
think they grow more quickly under 24

705
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,960
hours of light uh than they do with a

706
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,159
dark cycle during veg most books will

707
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,400
tell you to run a 16-hour day period and

708
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,000
an 8h hour dark period I think it's

709
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,640
great because it's how nature works and

710
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,119
you can't argue with that um I've

711
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,320
experimented with both sometimes if I'm

712
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:06,239
running a seed crop I will run a 16-hour

713
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:09,278
light cycle and then go to a 1212 cycle

714
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,960
sometimes I will run an 1113 cycle which

715
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,839
is odd but we'll talk about that later

716
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,440
on I learned that from DJ

717
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,879
Short uh so the that 168 light cycle is

718
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,200
great like I said it's on nature works

719
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,679
it also lets your equipment cool down

720
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,278
and take a little bit of a break and it

721
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,600
lets your electricity bill chill out for

722
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:26,038
a second let your meter quit spinning so

723
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,798
as long as your vegging plants are under

724
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,759
16 hours of light every day they should

725
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:32,480
be happy you can experiment with it uh

726
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:35,640
I'll do another show with more info on

727
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,120
light cycles and photo period later on

728
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,120
uh one thing I've really noticed is that

729
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:43,158
when I flip my plants to 1212 to flower

730
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:45,479
from this 24-hour light cycle they show

731
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:47,200
flower faster than the plants that had a

732
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,120
dark cycle during

733
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,278
veg and that's just one thing I've

734
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,879
noticed so if you're really looking for

735
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:53,839
a production crop that's something to

736
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,080
keep in mind since I just remembered

737
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,199
that that's kind of what inspired that

738
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,839
for me I think I'm might switch back and

739
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,319
I also uh like to keep my mother plants

740
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,639
under 1212 just to keep them from even

741
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:04,119
thinking that they may have the chance

742
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,038
to flower once they get root bound and

743
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,918
stuff they sometimes some of your mother

744
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:11,919
plants may try to Auto flower on you so

745
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,759
we've got our babies in new pots um and

746
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,278
we fed them they're under good lights I

747
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,640
put a fan lightly blowing over the

748
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,240
canopy to keep the air circulating uh

749
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,759
and if the temps and the humidity

750
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,120
humidity are correct in the room the

751
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,440
plants won't need water for uh 3 or 4

752
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,918
days if you water them enough right now

753
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,519
so this is a good time to start thinking

754
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,120
about Pest Management if you have NE oil

755
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,839
on hand give each plant a good spray

756
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,918
when the lights turn off you don't want

757
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,959
to spray them when the lights are on uh

758
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,880
that creates what I call Little

759
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,759
reflector Bubbles from the uh you know

760
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,120
the bubbles L on your plant the light

761
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:44,158
hits it just like a magnifying glass did

762
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,158
when you were a little kid and you used

763
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,799
to cook ants it'll happen to your plants

764
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,440
the grow light will work as the sun and

765
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,960
the bubble will work like a magnifying

766
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,798
glass and you'll get a little burn mark

767
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,240
a little white spot so spray when the

768
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:58,798
lights are off always try to spray when

769
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,519
the lights are off uh yeah that's

770
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,038
any book will tell you that uh NE will

771
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,879
keep most of your pests away once you're

772
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,759
in flower you'll need to rethink the ne

773
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,360
because you do not want to spray neem on

774
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,720
your flowering plants don't do that

775
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:13,398
it'll taste terrible if you make

776
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,159
concentrates with neem sprayed plants oh

777
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:17,319
excuse me if you make concentrates with

778
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,559
neem sprayed plants you can definitely

779
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:22,519
taste the neem so once you're in flour

780
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,240
stop spraying neem uh I've got a new

781
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:25,798
product I'm testing out if it works for

782
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,440
me I'm definitely going to share it with

783
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:29,798
you it's uh it's all organic was

784
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,679
recommended to me by somebody in the

785
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:33,720
horiculture industry not the Cannabis

786
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,278
industry so it's used for food crops so

787
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,798
it's completely safe uh it didn't smell

788
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:39,119
bad when I used it I'm kind of testing

789
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:40,879
it out now I'll let you know what I

790
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,599
think so you're now officially in the

791
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,039
FEG phase I feed bottle nutrients if I'm

792
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,558
using bottle nutrients I only feed them

793
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,919
once per week uh with plain pH water

794
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:50,678
throughout the rest of the week so I

795
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:52,120
personally feed all my plants on Monday

796
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,480
so as if you guys are listening to this

797
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,000
on Monday I'm probably waiting for the

798
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,079
lights to come on the flower room comes

799
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,640
on at 10:00 uh it'll click on uh I will

800
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,439
actually have my nutrients mixed up

801
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,038
already I'll start doing that about 9:30

802
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,600
it's Monday they're going to get fed uh

803
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,879
I think these plants are in they're

804
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,038
going to start week five today so I'll

805
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,880
start mixing up to the week five

806
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,119
stuff um get the pH adjusted in there

807
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,278
and then I'll throw some air stones in

808
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,759
there and let that stuff just bubble

809
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:18,679
around and let the nutrients Mingle for

810
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,798
a little while and then as soon as

811
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,559
lights come on I'll go in there and feed

812
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:26,038
them so uh I'll need the water again

813
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,798
usually by Thursday uh once they get

814
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,119
heavier into flour it may step up to

815
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:31,879
Wednesday they won't go as long so think

816
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,038
about how tall you can let your plants

817
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,559
get that's something you got to keep in

818
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,119
mind think about how tall your plants

819
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,158
can get uh think about if you want to

820
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,000
top them or let them grow naturally

821
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,080
because your plants some sativa plants

822
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,119
can double it in size during flower like

823
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:47,119
if you're growing the Bounty Killer that

824
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,759
thing is going to double in size during

825
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,599
your flower period so it's time to think

826
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,000
about how tall and wide your plants can

827
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,719
get before you need to flower them out

828
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,200
because that is going to be the next

829
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,880
major phase of your plants you got to

830
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,440
let them veg you probably got another

831
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,480
month month to 45 maybe two months if

832
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,798
you want to go crazy but I recommend

833
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,599
about 30 days veg time from here out so

834
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:09,200
don't get any bugs don't burn them with

835
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,839
nutrients take good care of them that's

836
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,558
super important uh I think that gets us

837
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,240
basically started through the veg phase

838
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,720
I plan to go in depth with each of these

839
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,200
little topics in the future we'll make

840
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,919
little branches from everything that

841
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,558
I've mentioned I want to get everybody

842
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,480
up to speed with the basics before we go

843
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:25,599
too deeply into specific stuff about

844
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,000
growing uh I've got tons of information
