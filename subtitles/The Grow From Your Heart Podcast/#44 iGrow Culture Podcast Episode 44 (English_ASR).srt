Tony and I built that Tony built it I

290
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,560
drew it in crayon pretty much on a paper

291
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,120
I was like this is what I want the home

292
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:02,399
to look like and then I drew tabs at the

293
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,240
top and then I was like this is what I

294
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,278
want the second page to look like and he

295

not take home the trophy uh some Coastal

359
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:11,199
you know you can handle that they're not

360
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,278
bitter about it although they were busy

361
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,879
The Garden of Weeden was a little bit

362
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:14,799

364
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,879
show and they kind of showed me what

365
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,519
they had to take care of and kind of

366
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:21,559
hinted at me that today was not the day

367
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,759
to come on a podcast so in the future

368

00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,039
talk on the show yeah which is

377
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,198

Springs you're able to call and make an

485
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,439
appointment the hardest part is getting

486
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,799
the appointment call every day until you

487
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,519
get an appointment because I had to call

488
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,838
three times in a row they called me back

489
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,879
after the third one I set an appointment

490
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,800
I got there early she saw I was early

491
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:17,720
she took me right when I got there boom

492
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:19,679
she got me out of there within 30

493
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,040
minutes my full appointment was 30

494
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,879
minutes uh giving her the paper she

495
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:25,078
reviewed the paper and it's one lady

496
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,600
that's there all the time I wish I could

497
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:28,039
remember her name I was excited and

498
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,240
anxious so I don't even know what she

499
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,799
looks like to tell you the truth you go

500
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,959
into that [ __ ] concert mode you know

501
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,399
what I mean I just want to see this and

502
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,958
get it done Med lady yes Med lady she

503
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,958

504
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,638
fingerprints on the digital

505
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,039
fingerprinter which is kind of fun and

506
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:42,440
then they run all your background checks

507
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,879
and then they take a picture of you and

508
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,120
she high-fives you and tells you have a

509
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,559
good day and that happened Tuesday at

510
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,639
11:00 today when I got my mail it is

511
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,000
Thursday as we record my Med badge came

512
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,039

514
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,240
fingerprints everything got done

515
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,240
probably within five or six hours it's

516
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,959
great hands down the the fastest turn

517
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,919
turnover rate I've heard of I went

518
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,318
prepared uh I went with everything I

519
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,880
needed because I I called and asked I

520
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,720
was like what am I going to need I have

521
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,559
like I have I have a small business I

522
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,640
have child support do I need to she's

523
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:14,918
like as long as your child support is

524
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,120
current you can prove it and as long as

525
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,959
your taxes are good on your small

526
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,038
business and I was like I got that watch

527
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,798
nice just had to I they never asked for

528
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:24,558
proof I guess they probably could tell

529
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:26,400
just by yeah they do some most of their

530
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,639
their application was 13 pages I think

531
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,840
seven of those pages are you signing

532
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,120
right writing your name signing and

533
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,599
dating saying that this agency can go

534
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:36,239
through all of my [ __ ] and this agency

535
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,159
can go through all of my [ __ ] and if I

536
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,359
missed anything this other agency can go

537
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,840
through all the other [ __ ] and it's like

538
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,599
everything but your medical records get

539
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,798
reviewed I think your money your

540
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,519
criminal like yeah and then she puts on

541
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,679
a rubber glove she puts on a rubber

542
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,720
glove and says you want to come back

543
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,400
here with me and they're just

544
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,679
fingerprinting you at that point but I

545
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,480
was like they're going that

546
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,880
far that's why everybody talks about how

547
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
bad it is maybe they're getting the

548
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,960
wrong treatment up there maybe you were

549
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:05,839
just nice maybe I cannot say I had that

550
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,240
experience but no but um I got mine

551
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,759
right before the first year last year so

552
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,759
oh I bet that there was a lot of people

553
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,200
um yeah well now in Springs you can make

554
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,879
appointments and they're kind of

555
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,400
sticklers they will tell you if you miss

556
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,679
your appointment it'll be a while before

557
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,200
you can get back because you go to the

558
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,080
bottom of the list and you're like oh

559
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,360
[ __ ] oh [ __ ] so you got to yeah and I

560
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,918
was I'm prepared I left hour and a half

561
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,279
early to get to 45 minute appointment 45

562
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,679
minute drive my puppy ate my b

563
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,918
so oops it's 10 bucks for a replacement

564
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,798
I don't think you need an appointment

565
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,400
for that yeah they told me I did oh [ __ ]

566
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:39,400
okay they do not take cash you guys if

567
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,480
you ever go into the med go get a money

568
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,840
order for the total oh that's changed

569
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,038
that's anything pretty much here except

570
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,439
for like that office in Springs isn't in

571
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:50,038
a shitty area but parts of Springs right

572
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,720
near like Colorado Springs on one side

573
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:52,558
of the street is gorgeous the other side

574
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,558
of the street you're like I don't want

575
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,519
to [ __ ] park my car here and they're

576
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,480
kind of in one of those like off to the

577
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,200
side areas they could be I wouldn't re

578
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,159
I'm not saying this they could easily be

579
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,480
a victim of robbery or something I'm not

580
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:04,919
saying go do it I'm saying they could so

581
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,519
it's wise that they don't keep a lot of

582
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,240
cash yeah and my badge alone was 300

583
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,558
bucks and they probably do 20

584
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,798
appointments a day at $150 or $300 per

585
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,158
appointment price went up for that too

586
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,720
yeah it's 150 for the key or 150 for the

587
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:20,640
support and 300 for the key I had to get

588
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,798
the key cuz I'm the guy all the prices

589
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,000
doubled yeah yeah yeah and if you're

590
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,879
upgrading badges it's still like 253

591
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,880
bucks to go from one to the other like

592
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,799
you should have just paid that in the

593
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,120
beginning so guys if you're you're

594
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,798
curious if you need to get the big badge

00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,519

just get the big one yeah yeah it makes

597
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:39,000
you a more valuable asset too you can

598
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,159
actually ask for more pay if you have

599
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,599

drug felonies is their main one yeah I

645
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,278
should have had the list here but I

646
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,360
didn't realize we were going to have

647
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:24,720
this conversation yeah I mean all that's

648
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:27,399
all that's there um and it it's

649
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,480
basically common sense at that point you

650
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,640
know um so if you can if you're in

651
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,440
another state or whatever just to

652
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,799
clarify like this means like to work

653
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,240
behind a counter selling herb to people

654
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,558
selling cannabis to people now this

655
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,240
doesn't mean you can't live in Colorado

656
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,359
and can't have three plants or six

657
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,120
plants whatever the state that that's

658
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,678
not what this you can still be a

659
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,399
caregiver you can still grow your own

660
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,000
this is just to work and a regulated

661
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,200
shop become part of the industry right

662
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,159
now I hate saying this but it's what I

663
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,679
feel and what I part of why I'm making

664
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,799
the business decisions I'm making I

665
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,038
think that in the future I genetics will

666
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:05,440
be able to breed inside of this large

667
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,240
facility that I've just been be be

668
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,360
Master grower of and right now if I

669
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,720
don't make a move like that the way that

670
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,199
I'm growing and the way that my business

671
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,120
model works I think the industry will

672
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,759
squeeze me right out I either need to

673
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,199
join it or get squeezed out of it and

674
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,000
this is my way to join it and not

675
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,840
disappear I want to be here for the Long

676
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,558
Haul I've thought about this I feel like

677
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,158
I'm selling out a little bit but I'd

678
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,200
rather uh give than not exist at all

679
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,120
that's what I got to do I totally agree

680
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,720
yeah so all right guys if you get that

681
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,278
application fill it out if you're not in

682
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,839

683
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:36,480

684
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:38,158

685
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,839
in person you have to be kind of

686
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,679
persistent almost be an [ __ ] about it

687
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:42,839
because so many people apply every day

688
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,640

mean it's uh it may be uh a cool job but

720
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,278
it is still very much a job this

721
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,159
business I visit dispensaries here in

722
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:58,200
town and when I go in there every week

723
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,039
and nobody's there or it's a different

724
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,840
people in there every week different

725
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,679
employees no customers well plenty of

726
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,720
customers especially you know

727
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,000
recreational and stuff like that there's

728
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,480
there's always lines U I've been going

729
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,119
to the spot for a couple of reasons

730
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,519
recently mostly to talk to the owners

731
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,399
out there and the bosses and to see if

732
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,359
we can negotiate and also my favorite

733
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,640
person my second favorite person I have

734
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,319
a daughter sorry girlfriend you're

735
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
second the daughter comes first just

736
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,558
kind of picking on you but she's out

737
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,000
there and I go out there to visit her

738
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,678
and go take her lunch or just go see

739
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,960
what's up and dude it's hard for her to

740
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,038
get away from the counter cuz they've

741
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,840
got business to go you're not going to

742
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,519
go and sit down behind a counter and be

743
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,798
like socializing with people you would

744
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,679
you would think that you know you still

745
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,759
have to have customer service but it's

746
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,759
you have 14 people out in the on the

747
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,879
lobby waiting you know I told the bosses

748
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,359
there that I don't want a bud tend uh I

749
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,440
said no I'd rather not be a bud tender

750
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,359
I'd just rather stick with being the

751
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,480
grower you know because it'll be

752
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,199
downtime for me but I think once in a

753
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,079

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,360
probably wouldn't be there on the next

805
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:23,398
one mean that's why the trimmers that

806
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,599
were here there were three trimmers here

807
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:26,918
for like four nights in a row and that's

808
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,480
kind of stressful to have for all three

809
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,399
of those people to take four nights of

810
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,079
their lives and trim pot for me with me

811
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:34,239
helping them I could have called two or

812
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,278
three other people but I liked and

813
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,919
trusted everybody here and I could have

814
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:39,359
driven to the store and came back and

815
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,159
nothing would have gone wrong that's why

816
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,558
I keep the people that I keep there it's

817
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,760
that's what it's about trust too be

818
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,599
trustworthy you know like and be kind of

819
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,359

likes to get picked on an AR one of my

965
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,038
favorite things to do Adam likes to

966
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,518
start a rant and then he'll stare at you

967
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,158
as he does it waiting for you to reply

968
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,079
and when you don't reply he just puts

969
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,919
his foot deeper in his mouth yeah just

970
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,240

government spending Bill if it reaches

00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,559
his desk although he oppos a provision

1246

00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:09,919

1251
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:11,519
congressman's name so awesome uh White

1252
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,519
House spokesman Josh Ernest said

1253
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,639
Thursday that despite reservations Obama

1254
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,679
is set to sign leg legislation to fund

1255
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:21,039
nearly the entire government through the

1256
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:22,838
end of the budget year September 30th uh

1257
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,838
District voters approved an initiative

1258
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,358
November 4th to allow possession of up

1259
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:30,358
to 2 ounces of pot or up to three mature

1260
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,318
plans for personal use but here we go

1261
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:34,000
language inserted by Republicans in the

1262
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,519
spending bill would bar the city from

1263
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,079
moving forward with legalization Ernest

1264
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:39,559
says the president believes Congress

1265
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,240
shouldn't interfere with the will of

1266
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:44,160
City voters on marijuana and other

1267
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:47,399
issues Obama supports statehood for the

1268
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:49,719
district so they wrote a new budget

1269
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,000
proposal by they uh it looks like the

1270
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:55,799
Republicans have submitted this right

1271
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,199
but in the wording they also try to

1272
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,559
block the legalization of cannabis in

1273
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,679
the district of colia so just in the

1274
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,400
city not in the state

1275
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,960
correct like you I know it's a district

1276
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,358
but you know what I'm saying it's it's

1277
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,720
the whole state from what I read it's

1278
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,400
going to be the whole state Washington

1279
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:17,480

1280
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,480
so I may not BL provision BL District of

1281
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,039
it's going be definitely see like the

1282
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,480
area around the White House and the you

1283
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,159
know like the oh yeah the presidential

1284
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,400
land you know what I'm saying the whole

1285
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:29,558
District yeah so here's what sucks is

1286
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,358
Obama would so it be legal Obama's down

1287
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,519
with DC being legalized he says he's

1288
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:36,440
cool he didn't write on his spokesperson

1289
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,199
says they have to pass the budget they

1290
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,119
have to pass that budget I could find

1291
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,639
that cocksucker's name can he go out can

1292
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,720
he just he's a president bro can why

1293
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:45,440
doesn't he just [ __ ] erase that line

1294
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,358
ump that [ __ ] out something to do with

1295
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,920
some kind of [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah I'm sure

1296
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,558
can I be the first one to say it like go

1297
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,318
ahead and say I see that he

1298
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,680
decriminalizes it at least before he

1299
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,838
gets out you know because he was

1300
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:59,358
so I'll leave it alone I'll leave it

1301
00:43:56,838 --> 00:44:00,759
alone and then the raids and stuff while

1302
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,000
he was here and he's still like there's

1303
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,040
a War on Drugs still and this that and

1304
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,039
the other

1305
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,480
and you know it's it's one of those

1306
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,039
things that I feel like if he's going to

1307
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,519
do anything

1308
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:16,400
that gives him a like on the way out

1309
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:18,400
it'll be something along that line if he

1310
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,920
can just bring it down to a new

1311
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,760
substance law you

1312
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,159
know I don't

1313
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,240
know yeah it just sucks because he's got

1314
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:30,960
to do something before he leaves this uh

1315
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:32,318
going to and uh spokesperson says um he

1316
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,280
believes Congress shouldn't interfere

1317
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:34,558
with the will of City voters on

1318
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,920
marijuana and other issues and he

1319
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:41,480
supports statehood uh what it does is it

1320
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,838
blocks uh any any Congressional or or

1321
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,559
City money being used to implement the

1322
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,279
program so it's like a shitty ultimatum

1323
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,800
yeah it's just like I mean we don't need

1324
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,280
your money they'll gladly give it to you

1325
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,318
by the droves have you not been paying

1326
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,960
attention what happened to voting and

1327
00:44:55,318 --> 00:45:00,759
then what the voters for happening like

1328
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,159
what happened to that it's like uh your

1329
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,000
parents telling you you go to a house

1330
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,719
party on Saturday when they damn well

1331
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,559
know you'll be in

1332
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:11,799
Texas I like that all right uh there's

1333
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,240
nothing I can do about it it's in the

1334
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,240
president's hands now I hope you guys in

1335
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:17,719
DC get to smoke your recreational legal

1336
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:19,959
cannabis right to tell them so they

1337
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:22,480
won't have a store but they can still

1338
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,199
you know I mean fight the good fight

1339
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,559
guys you know what they're doing is it

1340
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,838
sounds like they're encouraging the gray

1341
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,280
Market

1342
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:30,519
you know it it sounds like that's

1343
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,839
exactly what I thought when I read the

1344
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,880
article first I mean it sounds like a

1345
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:35,480
good place to be a caregiver in Colorado

1346
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,880
that gray Market is getting squeezed out

1347
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,039
I know pot's super illegal or expensive

1348
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,880
what not super illegal it's super

1349
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:42,519
[ __ ] expensive at the dispensaries

1350
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,119
but it seems like uh from hanging out in

1351
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:45,440
the shop as much as I have been lately

1352
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,000
there are a lot of people that would

1353
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,280
rather just go the go to the dispensary

1354
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
shop from the jars there are like 12

1355
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,920
strains on the shop on the Shelf at the

1356
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,719
shop you don't get choice and honestly

1357
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,720
in my opinion it's too expensive but

1358
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:59,919
that's cuz I'm a spoiled bit

1359
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:02,639
uh I grow my own herb I know what it

1360
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,358
costs I've been paying really low prices

1361
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,519
for several years now and to go there

1362
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:08,279
and it's double a little more than

1363
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:10,599
double what I'm used to paying but it's

1364
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,880
legal but and you don't have to wait for

1365
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:14,559
anybody you have to sit in a cushy comfy

1366
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,000
chair and listen to decent ree music

1367
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,920
they play good ree there too that has

1368
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,719
nothing to do with me uh you sit in

1369
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,720
these cozy little chairs and chill out

1370
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,279
and it's a chill environment and if you

1371
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:24,759
don't want to wait for your dude to show

1372
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,599
up if you just want to grab an eth on

1373
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,200
the way home from work if you don't want

1374
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:29,400
to cuz deals are sketchy in a parking

1375
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:31,639
lot and [ __ ] you don't want to be doing

1376
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,119
that anymore just go to that it's I

1377
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:35,679
could see the black and gray markets

1378
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,400
just being sh would be they would be

1379
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:40,598
totally wiped out I feel if it was

1380
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,200
accessible in every street corner you

1381
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:44,160
know almost like a damn liquor store

1382
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:47,639
where there's you know 13 of them in

1383
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,920
town spread out instead of you know 14

1384
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:51,759
of them out there in two mile area and I

1385
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,200
mean that's just hard you guys in states

1386
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,119
that are just about to legalize or that

1387
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,239
are pushing it you got to get on top of

1388
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:00,039
[ __ ] the day it pops you got to get your

1389
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,959
shop open because you have to start

1390
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:03,519
making enough money to comply with the

1391
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,800
regulations that are coming because now

1392
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,400
that Colorado has set the standard other

1393
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,720
places are just kind of adopting that uh

1394
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,358
they're just saying Colorado is doing

1395
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:13,000
this they kind of set it around that

1396
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:14,558
they're not making the same mistakes as

1397
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,280
well they already have a template you're

1398
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,200
not getting what we used to call here

1399
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,000
was the Wild Wild West that I talk about

1400
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:21,439
Jesse knows the Wild Wild West real well

1401
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,838
the good old days grow the quarter

1402
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,079
pounds in the houses rent other houses

1403
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,799
grow weed in there take that weed to

1404
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,359
shops and sell to the shop straight up

1405
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,318
for cash I'd walk in with the backpack

1406
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:32,838
full of pounds if I had a variety if I

1407
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:34,759
had five or six quarter pounds I could

1408
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:37,400
sell all of those quarter pounds for

1409
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,200
like 700 750 a quarter pound dude and

1410
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,519
walk out with cash back in the day there

1411
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:44,000
was a handful of shops here in town and

1412
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,280
in the area

1413
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:53,199
that really I guess only one of them

1414
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:55,480
survived but um uh well two um but uh um

1415
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,239
you know that's they didn't have Grow

1416
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,318
rooms I mean they they got stuff from

1417
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,558
guys like me and Jeff yeah and it was

1418
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:05,000
totally legal at the time I had that was

1419
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,839
all you know medical and it isn't that

1420
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,760
what people just went out and got their

1421
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:10,480
red cards and they you know that's

1422
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,000
that's what they did yeah but and that

1423
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,199
kind of squeezed the gray Market here

1424
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,119
did it not like in town just because it

1425
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:19,159
was accessible uh when we inside city

1426
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,400
limit when we made our dispensary public

1427
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:22,078
we had a dispensary that we kept

1428
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,358
slightly private we didn't let a lot of

1429
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,000
people know about it it was in a little

1430
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,480
kind of thing and we turn a

1431
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,239
l but eventually we decided let's take

1432
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,880
this to the big big room in our retail

1433
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:33,399
store and just kind of show that this is

1434
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,240
what we're doing uh we drop prices in

1435
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,160
this town dramatically uh it was 400

1436
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,598
bucks an ounce for any kind of kind bud

1437
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:43,000
for a while around here uh about 10

1438
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:45,039
years ago 10 or 12 years ago 400 bucks

1439
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,559
an ounce that Sour Diesel that we smoke

1440
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:50,279
400 bucks an ounce dude for 28 grams no

1441
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:52,160
love uh you'd sell it for 60 bucks an e

1442
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,400
and they'd be 3.4 you know what I mean

1443
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:57,239
he wouldn't even No Love on that bag at

1444
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,160
all and then we got the shop going and

1445
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:00,798
when we first did it ounces were 350

1446
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,519
just to keep us in business because we

1447
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:04,000
were selling out you know and then we

1448
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,559
had we had a big outdoor Harvest and we

1449
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,798
dropped down ounces down to 320 and then

1450
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,559
our patients were paying 280 and then uh

1451
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:13,000
we were seeing better quality because a

1452
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,079
lot of our stuff was outdoor we were

1453
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,679
growing a large outdoor and we saw the

1454
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:18,880
competitors the two shops that are still

1455
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:20,239
around they were getting good indoor and

1456
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,599
stuff I couldn't grow enough to keep it

1457
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,439
on our shelves we had a downtown

1458
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,400
location we were banging yeah so we

1459
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,798
dropped prices to 200 bucks an ounce at

1460
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,798
one point and that [ __ ] up the whole

1461
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:33,159
town I was getting hate mail hate calls

1462
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:35,000
death threats like people were mad at me

1463
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:37,639
cuz I was the one I was the face of that

1464
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,079
shop they thought it was all me kind of

1465
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:41,480
was but yeah we pissed off the town and

1466
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,039
Dro prices now now you can go score a

1467
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,599
good ounce in this town for 200 bucks

1468
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:45,880
and people still want to find cheaper

1469
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:48,079
ounces they're out there but for the

1470
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,838
good dank it's about dispensary price is

1471
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,920
usually you know depending on where you

1472
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:56,078
go it's about 450 out right now at the

1473
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,039
spot I think for a good dank ounce they

1474
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,640
got some good poison though I would if I

1475
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:01,838
had to smoke one that's what I'd go for

1476
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,440
I me thought about it one more news

1477
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,000
article I mentioned the part about Seth

1478
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,519
Rogan we may get to that we may not you

1479
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,318
guys Seth Rogan wanted to come to Denver

1480
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:09,358
and do a smoke out for his new movie uh

1481
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:11,279
they wouldn't let him smoke that's kind

1482
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,798
of the quick version he can't smoke in a

1483
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,720
public place anymore he had to serve

1484
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:17,559
tequila shitty all right so this one is

1485
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:19,719
cool uh Department of Justice

1486
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:21,400
ruling yeah sorry go ahead we'll get

1487
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:22,959
we'll get we'll try to read that one we

1488
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,440
will since you just said that uh Indian

1489
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,039
tribes can legalize pot on their lands

1490
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,920
uh and then the sub headline if tribes

1491
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,798
can balance all the potential social

1492
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,400
issues it could be a really huge

1493
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:34,239
opportunity says Seattle attorney

1494
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
Anthony broadman whose firm represents

1495
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,798
tribal governments throughout the West

1496
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,280

December 11th it's written by Jeff

1498

1500
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:48,400
Department of Justice said Thursday that

1501
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,159
American Indian tribes can grow and sell

1502
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,880
marijuana on their lands as long as they

1503
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:53,519
follow the same Federal conditions laid

1504
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,160
out for states that have legalized the

1505
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,199
drug Oregon us attorney Amanda Marshall

1506
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,798
said Thursday the announcement addresses

1507
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:01,279
questions raised by tribes about how

1508
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:03,039
legalization of pot in States like

1509
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,480
Oregon Washington and Colorado would

1510
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,838
apply to Indian

1511
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,880
lands only three tribes have expressed

1512
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:10,000
interest in growing and selling

1513
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,880
marijuana said Marshall who co-chaired a

1514
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,519
group that developed the policy one is

1515
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,318
in California one in Washington and one

1516
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:18,599
state in the midwest that she did not

1517
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:21,199
name uh that's been the primary message

1518
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,079
tribes are getting to us as us attorneys

1519
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,118
Marshall said from Portland what will

1520
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,640
the US as Federal Partners do to assist

1521
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,160
tribes in protecting our children and

1522
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,000
Families Our tribal businesses our

1523
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,480

1524
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,599

1525
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,798
or Indian County when states are no

1526
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:39,079
longer there to partner with us

1527
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:40,880
marijuana marijuana abuse do you guys

1528
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:44,400
see a lot of

1529
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,760
that uh over here yeah a lot of abuse

1530
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,720
just over here right yeah because you're

1531
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,160
just like [ __ ] oh that that four

1532
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:52,239
grams of scissor hash I don't need that

1533
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:55,279
just thr that in the trash I that makes

1534
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:57,679
me laugh because I'm thinking about what

1535
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,359
does get abused on any reservations I've

1536
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,919
been on well I was going to ask you how

1537
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:02,400
do you feel about that too you know

1538
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,798
since they're allowed to do everything

1539
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,480
that they're you know now they're

1540
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:09,719
they're making money in collecting uh

1541
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,199
tax for the state but that all that land

1542
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:15,159
is taxfree like I don't I I'm with that

1543
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:16,798
you know like we've [ __ ] stolen the

1544
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:18,399
whole West from them

1545
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:20,480
but

1546
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,000
like you're if you're going to make

1547
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:26,798
money but if you're going to sell it to

1548
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,719
the public as like Indian grown herb

1549
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:30,280
you should at least pay tax on the land

1550
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,358
that's it's doing that you know what I'm

1551
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,160
saying like if for your plot for I don't

1552
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,039
think this really approaches that I'm

1553
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:37,199
sure the state would still require

1554
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:38,639
they're definitely going to take taxes

1555
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,199
for the herb but not for the for the

1556
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:41,759
land they you can't retx the land well

1557
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:44,399
that's the whole problem with having an

1558
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,440
Indian business on free land though is

1559
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,838
that's that's the fight they've been

1560
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,559
fighting for many years is they won't

1561
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:52,039
let them have any kind of businesses on

1562
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:53,519
there that's going to prove profitable

1563
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:55,039
you know when they open a casino or

1564
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,358
something like that it's not on Indian

1565
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:00,279
land it's on you know some outskirt land

1566
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:02,719
that they've had to buy like separately

1567
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,200
and pay land tax on that's that's been

1568
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,039
one of the the large arguments that I've

1569
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,480
I've at least seen over the past couple

1570
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:10,199
years I don't know enough about that to

1571
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,159
argue you all right so you win all right

1572
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:14,719
no I was asking you good job I'm giving

tribal authorities and that marijuana is

1594
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:56,399
still illegal under federal law the US

1595
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,920
government's prosecution prior

1596
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,960
priorities involve pot related gang

1597
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,200
activity violence sales to kids and

1598
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,798
trafficking will continue she said

1599
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:05,480
problems could arise for tribes with

1600
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:07,039
lands in states that still Outlaw

1601
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,960
marijuana due to the likelihood that

1602
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,239
marijuana could be transported or sold

1603
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,000
outside tribal boundaries she added

1604
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:14,479
Seattle attorney Anthony broadman whose

1605
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,798
firm represents tribal governments

1606
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,480
throughout the West said the

1607
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:19,519
announcement represents a potential for

1608
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,358
enormous economic develop development

1609
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:24,639
tool here uh yeah if tribes can balance

1610
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:27,000
all the potential social issues it could

1611
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:28,519
be a really huge opportunity

1612
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,880
I think they'll be able to handle it

1613
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:31,400
there's a I want to read this one X

1614
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,280
paragraph and then I we can rant on the

1615
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,200
part that's the elephant in the room but

1616
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,720
those social issues are Monumental

1617
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:38,679
Indian tribes have been decimated by

1618
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,558
drug abuse broadman said tribal

1619
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:42,879
regulations of pot are going to have to

1620
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,319
dovetail with tribal values making sure

1621
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,880
marijuana isn't a Scourge like alcohol

1622
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:50,920
or tobacco all right I'm going to sound

1623
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,160
racist maybe generalization we all know

1624
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,519
that natives have trouble with alcohol

1625
00:54:54,159 --> 00:55:00,118
not all of them but the ones that do

1626
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:02,400
really [ __ ] do uh alcohol is a

1627
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:05,280
horrible thing that ruins tons of lives

1628
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,880
not just Native Americans the problem is

1629
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,798
that you concentrate them in one area

1630
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,440
and then you look at them from afar and

1631
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:15,440
then you notice similarities and

1632
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,280
stereotypes just as in any race

1633
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,760
or

1634
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:24,599
okay but at how is Herb going to be a

1635
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:28,200
big problem on a I'm frustrated I'm my

1636
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:30,640
never seen we've seen that it works here

1637
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:32,919
it's working and Washington hasn't blown

1638
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:34,480
up yet let's try to replace the alcohol

1639
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,200
abuse on the reservation with some

1640
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,599
cannabis enjoyment [ __ ] yeah and then

1641
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,279
maybe there the problems that are

1642
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,599
associated with alcohol abuse I've got a

1643
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,280
whole list of them because I had another

1644
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:43,599
podcast planned we could talk about for

1645
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,280
I got five hours could you not look at

1646
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:49,680
Alaska almost in that same way I mean

1647
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:52,960
Alaska aren't aren't Native American but

1648
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:56,960
I mean a lot of I'm thinking like Alaska

1649
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:59,358
Utah Arizona uh New Mexico Oklahoma

1650
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,639
Colorado all those tribes like I mean

1651
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:04,279
really really bad problems um or I mean

1652
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:08,199
not sound like a dick but I mean I've

1653
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:10,280
been around a reservation or two so um

1654
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:12,759
but uh yeah no I just I think it'd be an

1655
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,960
awesome development thing for him

1656
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,079
economical development for sure [ __ ]

1657
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,480
right getting back to the land I mean

1658
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:19,960
yeah all right so let's read about these

1659
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,199
taxes part the tax part here it says

1660
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,559
tribes selling marijuana may not be

1661
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:24,519
subject to State and local taxes

1662
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:29,160
allowing them to undercut

1663
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:32,199
off-reservation sales so maybe not yeah

1664
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:34,759
in in Washington taxes had 25% of the

1665
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:36,798
price of pot also in Colorado uh but

1666
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,559
Allison hulc hulc yeah I said that right

1667
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:40,679
a primary drafter of Washington State's

1668
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,640
legalization measure said most people in

1669
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:44,798
larger States won't want to drive to

1670
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:47,440
far-flung reservations to buy pot you're

1671
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:49,239
crazy dude imagine that Indian dank weed

1672
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,639
what was the was it here on the podcast

1673
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,318
that we had the statistic where we got

1674
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:55,078
$30 million just in recreational sales

1675
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:57,318
oh yeah and 70% of that came from out of

1676
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,200
sters 70% of that came from out of state

1677
00:56:57,318 --> 00:57:01,679
and then every time I go in and talk to

1678
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:05,159
the security guard at any dispensary

1679
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:07,118
Taxas [ __ ] Taxas I guarantee 50% of

1680
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:08,399
that was Texas uh I'm going to go kind

1681
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,559
of fast because we're approaching an

1682
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,960
hour the Yakama Nation I'm I said that

1683
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,559
wrong Yak Nation sorry I apologize in

1684
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,119
Washington state recently passed a ban

1685
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,000
on marijuana on the reservation and is

1686
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:20,119
trying to Halt State regulated pot sales

1687
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,798
and grows on lands off the reservation

1688
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:23,760
where it still holds hunting and fishing

1689
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:25,400
rights so they don't want you growing

1690
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,880
where they can hunt and fish with which

1691
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,798
makes sense there's actually a conflict

1692
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,880
with that or if it's just politics just

1693
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:33,239
politics they don't want to find our

1694
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,640
botanic air bottles in their hunting

1695
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:37,000
grounds well yeah no no I just I wonder

1696
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:38,480
if there's actually anyone that wants to

1697
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,559
grow in their hunting grounds it

1698
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,199
actually says uh the Hoopa Hoopa Valley

1699
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,960
tribe in Northern California has battled

1700
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:45,118
illegal pot plantations on its

1701
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,199
reservation where they cause

1702
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:50,200
environmental damage but you know that's

1703
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:51,519
illegal at any rate there are 566 tribes

1704
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:53,000
around the country recognize I'm going

1705
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:54,480
to go fast and skim recognized by

1706
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,920
federal government uh there's going to

1707
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,639
be a lot of Consulting happening yes for

1708
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,280
sure

1709
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,879
uh limited resources in a vast amount of

1710
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,839
territory to cover Federal prosecutors

1711
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,920
will not prosecute minor cases yay uh

1712
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:07,038
tribal policy is based on the so-called

1713
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,000
coal memo named after the deputy

1714
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,319
attorney general who wrote it in which

1715
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,798
justice department said the federal

1716
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,679
government wouldn't intervene as long as

1717
00:58:11,798 --> 00:58:15,159
legalization States tightly regulate the

1718
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:17,078
drug and take steps to keep it from

1719
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:20,199
children criminal cartels and federal

1720
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:21,720
property in all the memo said us attorne

1721
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:24,358
has reserved the right to prosecute for

1722
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:26,239
eight issues sales to kids uh marijuana

1723
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:28,480
proceeds going to criminal Enterprises

1724
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:31,358
shipping marijuana to other states where

1725
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,079
it is illegal guys quit doing that [ __ ]

1726
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:35,400
illegal sales the news about that

1727
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:37,440
firearms and violence drug driving and

1728
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,358
other health issues growing marijuana on

1729
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,440
public lands and possession of marijuana

1730
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:43,920
on federal property so hopefully

1731
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,720
eventually they're going to let the

1732
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,280
Indians the natives you guys the natives

1733
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:50,719
will be able to grow on their land and

1734
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,200
maybe have their own Indian dispensary I

1735
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:53,759
think they grow some dank bro that's

1736
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:57,239
what they do they they're an

1737
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:59,319
agricultural oh yeah yeah agricultural

1738
00:58:57,239 --> 00:59:01,479
people they would make the Dank I'm sure

1739
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:03,279
there would may be ones that would abuse

1740
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,760
it just like anywhere else but for the

1741
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,960
most part I bet they would be real

1742
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,319
respectful about it you know what I'm

1743
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:11,639
saying I mean that's have they not have

1744
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:14,159
they not like used that as ceremonial

1745
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:15,440
herb I mean I I don't know they use but

1746
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:16,838
I'm sure if you gave it to them it'd be

1747
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,838
the perfect thing it's what the rosta is

1748
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:22,920
used for meditation for a reason yeah um

1749
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:25,078
I don't think that it was around but you

1750
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,680
know it' be a more modern it grows wild

1751
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:31,000
in Iowa you know like if you want to get

1752
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,838
technical the three of us abuse cannabis

1753
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,960

01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,318
film Monday night in a Denver movie

1783
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,319
theater filled with marijuana smoke and

1784
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:35,199
hundreds of his fans but will movie

1786
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,038
Rogan has said he thinks it should

1787
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:39,679
happen the city of Denver's executive

1788
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:42,000
director of marijuana policy thinks the

1789
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:46,838
screening should obey Colorado law SS

1790
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,838
the marijuana smoke um so he planned on

1791
01:00:46,838 --> 01:00:51,279
debuting his new movie at the Oriental

1792
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:52,759
Theater and he tweeted about it actually

1793
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,200
he said we're going to all get stoned in

1794
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:57,000
the theater and that was kind of a bad

1795
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,480
idea because can't really happen because

1796
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,480
of the rules here in Colorado they are

1797
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,798
super strict about that kind of [ __ ] so

1798
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,358
first Rogan started tweeting about

1799
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:06,280
getting high inside the Colorado theater

1800

01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:11,439
contacted Sony to tell them the audience

1803
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,400
couldn't light up inside their space as

1804
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,000

1805
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,519
Sony told the film Center the evening

1806

really cool adventurous dab spots so as

1933
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,680
the duo took stage Rogan started things

1934
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,358
off by saying [ __ ] the police which

1935
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,278
elicited big cheers from the prop poot

1936
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,400
crowd audience questions range from

1937
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:41,760
actual threats by North Korea over the

1938
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,639
film uh because Rogan having North Korea

1939
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,799
threaten nuclear war is not ideal yeah

1940
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:47,118
we won't even go into that part um so

1941
01:05:45,798 --> 01:05:49,079
Rogan made sure to correct a question

1942
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,519
about smoking blls he said first I smoke

1943
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:53,839
joints five to seven a day but on night

1944
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:55,880
on a night that was light on both joints

1945
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:58,440
and Bulls more were left simply handing

1946
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:00,440
him various pot products for later in

1947
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:03,000
the state that is famously that famously

1948
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:05,880
legalized it most of the weed smoking C

1949
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,838
repetitious Sur repetitiously that's a

1950
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,559
good [ __ ] word took place in a side

1951
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,798
alley next to the theater maybe next

1952
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:13,079
year ran exclaimed the way things are

1953
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:17,400
trending with pot consumption

1954
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:19,440
enforcement perhaps next year looks even

1955
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,200
worse yeah they're really cracking down

1956
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,679
we can't puff here in Colorado you have

1957
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:25,159
to be in a private house they want you

1958
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,719
at home smoking your pot it's pretty

1959
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:29,679
much the only place they want you doing

1960
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:32,199
it which there are a few hotels sorry

1961
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:33,919
that advertise 420 friendly they do um

1962
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:35,480
our favorite hotel that we drive past

1963
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,838
that we see that advertised I don't

1964
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,599
remember the name um it's in manitu

1965
01:06:36,838 --> 01:06:40,278
Springs it's right outside of manitu as

1966
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:42,119
we uh head back from the Monte Factory

1967
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:44,760
you see the 420 friendly signed they've

1968
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:46,920
taken down the 420 friendly part it no

1969
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,680
longer says that maybe they're probably

1970
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,440
still 420 friendly but they probably had

1971
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:53,440
to just quit advertising such just to

1972
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:57,318
keep themselves out of trouble yeah yeah

1973
