fun taking dabs with you we hang out a

99
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,880
lot and I like it um so Spence is the

100
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,199
winner of the mountain region Secret Cup

101
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,478
uh some people might not be familiar

102
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,520
with the secret cup so let's take a

103
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:33,839
little bit to tell them what that is um

104
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:36,279
The Secret Cup is a well it's actually a

105
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,119
tour which they go to different places

106
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,198
they go to two places in Cali if I'm

107
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,319
correct um I don't know if it's ever

108
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,879
been put that way as a tour because that

109
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,319
would be a hell of a marketing way to

110
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,800
put some shirts out I mean that's how I

111
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,360
think of it it's a tour and then there's

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,680
a championship in the middle at the end

113
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,759
of the tour that's a good way to put it

114
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,240
I hope they're listening and they get a

115
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:59,120
marketing idea from that um but yeah

116
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,639
California Seattle here maybe Michigan

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,759
I'm not sure Arizona Rhode Island and

118
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,240
then all the it's basically a

119
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,759
competition of anywhere from 30 to 40

120
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,319
hash makers all enter a certain amount

121
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,038
of product um and then each one of the

122
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,038
people that enter are considered judges

123
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,038
because we all receive a judge pack go

124
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:23,279
through them and kind of give everything

125
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:26,360
a score from smell you know strength

126
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:30,159
smoothness harshness color flavor you

127
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,639
know down the line so each contestant

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,800
actually get uh3 of every sample right

129
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,960
yeah so you get to taste what everybody

130
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,079
else is D or what everybody else entered

131
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,758
and you're the judge right yeah and

132
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,478
we're the judges so that's kind of a

133
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,639
good thing about it is you know it's not

134
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,758
being judged by just you know random

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,240
people or like you know just it's not a

136
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,759
well it's technically is a blind judge

137
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,639
because nobody gets to see what you know

138
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,000
yeah what everybody's entries are so

139
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,960
it's all just numbered in whatever

140
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,240
numbers or what you vote for so when you

141
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,478
got your judges kit how how long did it

142
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,560
take you to find your your entry like 2

143
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,038
minutes 2 minutes yeah your you just had

144
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,360
a lot of taste yeah yeah no well I just

145
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,240
you could go through the entries and

146
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,840
kind of just smell and I make the hash

147
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,800
so you kind of get attached I guess you

148
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,478
could say to like you know which is

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,639
yours and what what is not I had there

150
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,199
was a couple that I was like e maybe and

151
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,120
then as soon as you find it it's perfect

152
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,360
it's like yeah that's it I could tell my

153
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,680
flowers sorry guys I'm all choked up I

154
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,680
actually I went to the secret cup for

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,918
two days and took an amazing amount of

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,840
dabs and then today I went hung out with

157
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,598
some friends in Denver and my lungs and

158
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,038
throat are burnt out from dab and you

159
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:37,240
guys got to hydrate if you're dabbing

160
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:38,959
that's something that I'm learning more

161
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,598
hydration Spence reaches through the

162
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,918
water as I say that we're all redyed and

163
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:45,959
throat

164
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,639
dried so uh yeah everybody got to I had

165
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,318
the honor of tasting a couple of my

166
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,519
friends were judges and entrance

167
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,680
contenders I don't know what the hell

168
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,598
they were called they were judges and

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,519
they entered and I got to taste parts of

170
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:59,079
their sample packs some were amazing

171
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,079
some uh I don't think I would take a

172
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,598
second da of a lot of those yeah I mean

173
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,198
there's

174
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:09,439
definitely there's was

175
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:12,199
38 competitors in this one so 383s you

176
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,839
got to go through and you know it's kind

177
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,960
of tough depending on which kind of what

178
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,799
kind of like I'm a weed snob so I'm

179
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,560
definitely going to be an oil snob you

180
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,960
know what I'm saying so it's just and a

181
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,680
lot of it's personal preference whether

182
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,719
or not you like it this way or you like

183
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,360
it that way so it's kind of that's why

184
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,440
it's good that we're the judges cuz it's

185
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,598
at least honest opinion

186
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,800
I wanted to wait a little bit to get

187
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,360
into live resin but I was worried with

188
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,280
you entering live resin people were

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,360
going to say it's not stable because the

190
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,359
popular [ __ ] the rage is shattered is

191
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,319
shatter and the live resin is not

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,038
shatter at all it's kind of it looks

193
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,319
like oil yeah it's like oil um and then

194
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,598
depending where it's at you know it's I

195
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,879
think somebody said 66 degrees is when

196
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,959
it actually gets it'll shatter if your

197
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,840
if your house is 66 degrees like your

198
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,038
house cold you'll have shatter live

199
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,598
resin

200
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:03,318

00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,638
bit of lemon um OG like that OG pness

329
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,719
and sometimes the pine can transfer over

330
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,399
to like a citrus

331
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,759
lemon um so it's a very it was a good

332

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,199
medicine uh how do you uh when you're

355
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,758
looking in the room what makes you

356
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,319
say that strain and that's scen right or

357
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,919
that plant and that plant right there

358
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,440
are going to make award-winning oil

359
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,759
um

360
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,639
honestly it's more of just you kind of

361
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,879
literally go plant to plant and just you

362
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,480
know you can't you can't do it in the

363
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,759
day it kind of takes you know a week or

364
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,440
two you know as they're finishing to be

365
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,240
able to tell which flavors are going to

366
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,279
come

367
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,759
through

368
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,958
um I was I don't even think I was going

369
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,959
to do well I made another batch the

370
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,559
green ribbon batch

371
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,599
um but the green ribbon just didn't

372
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,000
carry it the same like when you feel

373
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,560
some plants you know how they're like

374
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,159
some plants are like super sticky where

375
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,799
you touch them and then your fingers are

376
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:42,879
stuck together and there's some you

377
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,198
touch and you get like the stringiness

378
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,799
resin and then there's some you touch

379
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:48,198
where it's like just wet where you don't

380
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,719
even it's like slick uhhuh so you just

381
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,078
kind of go and look for different you

382
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,839
know okay for me it's a lot about

383
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,479
flavors so I like to you know your hash

384
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,279
is always flavorful I had a bunch of

385
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,680
your shatter with me at the secret cup

386
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:02,360

don't know what I can leave in he smokes

399
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,720
mids though so it's cool hash team

400
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,639
mids poor guy cannot get away from that

401
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,959
[ __ ] so uh we talk a lot about live

402
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,519
resin on this show I am not a hash maker

403
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,359
everybody tells me that I've always got

404
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,480
great hash they complement it I got to

405
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,759
say I don't make hash I know a lot about

406
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,278
making hash because uh little Kev bro is

407
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,278
my buddy you're my buddy I know how to

408
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,360
read uh the internet tells you all about

409
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,120
making dabs if you want to know I like

410
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,680
to be educated but I don't make hash uh

411
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,759
I've been trying my best to describe

412
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,919
live resin to people a lot of people

413
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,639
have asked about it after you exhale

414
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,039
that [ __ ] monstrous dab I owe a

415
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,039
dollar for that one I owe a dollar every

416
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:05,759
time I say the f- word on the show but

417
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:08,120
after you yeah uh will you teach me and

418
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,759
our listeners a little lesson about what

419
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,959
live resin is and kind of how it's

420
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:17,120
done um okay so everybody's heard of

421
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,679
fresh Frozen bubble hash so basically

422
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,519
where you harvest your plant you

423
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,919
essentially freeze it or flash freeze it

424
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:28,959
um and then for ice hat you'd you know

425
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:31,919
wash it in your bags or whatever so now

426
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,919
now instead of you know as far as

427
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,039
opening blasting I know people who do it

428
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:39,039
live resin but I think it's once the

429
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,879
Clos closed loop game came out and we

430
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,480
figured out you could do that same

431
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:47,120
process in a Clos loop at a bigger scale

432
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,039
it it completely changes P for the

433
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,440
better in my opinion I think so um

434
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:56,559
obviously yeah so basically it's fresh

435
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,279
frozen Clos Loop BHO um all right if

436
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,000
done proper I'm going to I'm going to go

437
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:02,679
a little slow on that one he's taking

438
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,199
plants that are ready for Harvest chop

439
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:07,359
them down freeze them in the Deep Freeze

440
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,038
and then put them in a closed loop

441
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,958
butane extraction system which uh we'll

442
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,798
talk more about that I think Kevin and I

443
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,919
have talked about that but there's open

444
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,798
blasting and closed loop Spence uses a

445
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,038
Clos loot method and blast the fresh

446
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:22,480
frozen like that M does it need to be

447
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:25,558
vacuum purged after that um yeah well

448
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,120
once it comes through your system you

449
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,798
it's really you know

450
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,959
it takes a lot of the butane out before

451
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,639
you even get to touch the product using

452
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,558
that closed loop using the closed loop

453
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,160
so it pumps it out because it takes all

454
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:42,960
the liquid back out ah you know so then

455
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,400
you're left which is your product um as

456
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,240
far as you know flavors I really think

457
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,840
it keeps a better tur profile it

458
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,319
honestly if you all right so this is

459
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,480
going to be kind of hard to understand

460
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,798
but it tastes like it smells when it's

461
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,440
growing if you can understand what you

462
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,558
know like when you touch a plant and you

463
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,480
smell your fingers that crazy smell you

464
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:05,279
get that it doesn't ever smell like that

465
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,120
once it's dried and cured but once you

466
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,200
when you're stripping or making hash

467
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:12,079
from a fresh product you get that fresh

468
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,558
flavor it's like if your bud was a fruit

469
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,480
and you took a bite out of that fruit

470
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,759
that's what this hash tastes like and I

471
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,319
love it it's got uh the turpenoid and

472
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,200
that's yeah the turp profile in there

473
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,960
and that's just everyone's new word now

474
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,960
is TPS turs TPS so I just feel like an

475
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,960
[ __ ] every time I say turps but the

476
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,840
turps in that it's tppy slurpie just

477
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,200
like a big it's like a bite of candy

478
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,240
every time you hit a dab of it it's

479
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,440
amazing it literally is like it could be

480
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,240
dessert like one somebody needs to make

481
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,720
some Jilly Bean live resin oh don't

482

498
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,319
um but yeah so live res is basically you

499
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,759
know fresh fresh frozen V just I think

500
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,119
it's a more flavor vacuum purging it I

501
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,679
think that's what I was asking oh yeah

502
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:30,038
vacuum purging after you know everything

503
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,519
I do goes into an oven after you know

504
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:34,640
you extract it from your system because

505
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,879
your system takes um pretty much a good

506
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,720
majority of it out so but you still got

507
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,400
to go through your vacuum process to you

508
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,558
know keep cleaning and removing certain

509
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,120
gases and stuff like that uh do you know

510
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,079
do you do you do anything special to

511
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,678
your plants or flowers U if you know

512
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:54,519
you're going to make oil out of them for

513
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:59,480
live resin um no um I have done like

514
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:01,599
what was it 48 Hours of dark before um

515
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,440
but no I I really think with as far as

516
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,199
live it's all about the product you put

517
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,480
in you know the better you know the

518
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,240
flowers that are going in the better the

519
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,798
oil is going to come out so no trim run

520
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,599
in this room right yeah I'll pass no

521
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:18,798
trim run I I honestly like from my trim

522
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,759
like my personal stuff I still open

523
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,000
blast it and I'll make it it's you know

524
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,000
I think it comes out better than the

525
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,880
closed loop but it's good for patience

526
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,038
people need it but we're snobs over here

527
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,600
and uh I'll I'll stick with this Nug Run

528
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:31,359
yeah the nug I can almost tell a

529
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,639
difference uh I can almost tell even

530
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,719
smoke and shatter I can tell a

531
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,679
difference in nug and Earl uh Nug Run

532
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,360
and trim run yeah definitely tell

533
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,840
difference and you can taste once you

534
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:43,038
start smoking live you can taste the

535
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,119
difference between if it's in a closed

536
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,798
loop and if it's not in a closed loop I

537
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,719
feel super spoiled now that I smoke so

538
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,879
much live it's like I just it's a good

539
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,480
it's a good I find myself hiding my live

540
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,440
like just my live resin's over here and

541
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,038
the rest of my shatter is over here we

542
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,720
can smoke this shatter all day the live

543
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,720
resin I'll bark at you like a dog if you

544
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,120
get near it yeah all right so uh a

545
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,919
little bit more about the secret cup

546
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,038
stuff dude you're a freaking Champion

547
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:11,240
now bro you are a secret cup winter has

548
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:14,158
it sunk in yet um no well what's funny

549
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,159
is about this is I went to what was it

550
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,120
Secret Cup last year when they had it in

551
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,240
Denver um I went with a couple buddies

552
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,038
of mine and that was like right when I

553
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,159
was really first getting into really

554
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:29,519
making like oil like more than just you

555
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,039
know every now and then um

556
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,400
um and I remember telling everybody I

557
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,240
was like dude we're going to enter this

558
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,919
cup next year and we're going to win it

559
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,400
and then you know a year later we

560
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:40,559
[ __ ] oh snap my bad you could say

561
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,440
whatever you want I'm just trying not to

562
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,839
say [ __ ] so much that's another dollar

563
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,120
actually every time I say it I owe a

564
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:49,000
dollar to a charity so it's kind of not

565
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:51,119
that bad

566
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,599
um and I said we were going to win it

567
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,959
and we came out and you know brought I

568
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,519
think we came real proper and then a lot

569
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,519
of the differences between I think

570
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,158
us which I don't speak for everybody you

571
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,480
know what I'm saying because I don't you

572
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,760
know I don't know everybody that

573
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,360
competed but like we didn't have to

574
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,798
Source our product we were able to

575
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,599
actually go pick it and that I think

576
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,278
that made a difference as far as hug

577
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,839
difference flavor being able to pick

578
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:18,558
certain flavors and knowing what you

579
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,119
want and hash you know it was just easy

580
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,879
I would I would have hated to have to go

581
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:23,918
Source you know what I'm saying just

582
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,278
find something that's good enough to

583
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,799
make I actually have a guy that comes

584
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:28,960
straight to me for his secret cut

585
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,639
material and yeah he's always like bro I

586
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,159
need it I need this crop at this time

587
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,960
and he me a head up you understand how

588
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,640
it is it's just all about quality for

589
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,240
sure for sure um and then I grow weed

590
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,840
first before I make hash so you know

591
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,079
it's it's a lot different when you spend

592
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,918
10 weeks with a plant and then make hash

593
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,480
instead of buying it off the shelf and

594
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,200
making hash with it there just it's a

595
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,200
lot more full circle yeah um which is

596
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,759
important to us like as we say it's

597
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,759
grown by us processed by us and smok by

598
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:02,119
us from seed to live resin to a cup yeah

599
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,599
nice that's that's super awesome so it's

600
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:06,079
it's cool it's been a fun experience

601
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,119
hasn't really I don't know if it sank in

602
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,038
because I wasn't you know honestly I

603
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,639
went in with a thinking I was going to

604
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,720
have a top three finish that's just how

605
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm just competitive I hate losing um so

606
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,880
it was cool being able to go in I almost

607
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,519
thought I lost once they did all the

608
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,360
awards and then third second I was like

609
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:26,960
oh no we didn't win that's something I

610
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:29,439
wanted to ask you uh they did they did

611
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,240
uh like highest CBD they did best TPS

612
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,200
they did crowd's choice or something

613
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,720
like that uh what was it connoisseur's

614
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,919
choice connoisseur's choice and then

615
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,960
they do third second and then Big D said

616
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,679
so first place and he said something to

617
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,319
the equivalent of you guys already know

618
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,600
who it is and I was like oh then it's

619
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:48,839
probably somebody that's already gotten

620
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,558
an award is what I assumed but then he

621
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,240
said garden and as soon as he said

622
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:53,639
Garden I think I peed a little bit on

623
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,839
myself I was like

624
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,000
who um he went through and did second

625
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,639
place and it was the the bubble which

626
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,440
the bubble was fire I'll give it that

627
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,159
you know what I'm saying um I didn't

628
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,600
even know it was bubble that won the

629
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,919
second place solventless bubble um but I

630
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,918
looked at Maddie and I was like we might

631
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,400
not

632
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,880
win and then like he did the

633
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,600
announcement whatever and it was tight

634
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,320
and I wish I would I wasn't thinking I

635
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,599
was going to win so like my speech was

636
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,399
super like

637
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,199
short and to the point I guess you could

638
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,200
say it was well it was perfect uh you

639
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,960
said something about where you're from

640
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,360
this ilal so it's great to be here with

641
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,038
all these people making hash and

642
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,278
celebrating and winning and that's

643
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,038
pretty pretty

644
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:38,278
awesome so you didn't know you were

645
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:40,599
going to win no I didn't didn't know I

646
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:42,359
was going to win um I think I thought I

647
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:44,199
was going to win but you know it just

648

657
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,640
the dude who came up with live resin

658
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,120
nice dude you beat that guy his own when

659
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,600
he was talking in his speech he was like

660
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,558
there's some there's some guys out here

661
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:19,918
doing you know my same technique that

662
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:23,720
are killing it um and I'm going say he

663
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:27,038
was regarding me um but yeah his is his

664
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,399
was on point uh he did it was sour d

665
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:32,038
deep chunk and Gorilla Glue and I think

666
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:35,359
it was just it was really good but it

667
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:36,919
was just too complex it wasn't like

668
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,199
straight to the not straight to the

669
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,880
point but just the glue and the sour are

670
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,159
almost the same thing and then the Deep

671
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,880
chunk is I think a sour diesel deep

672
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,760
chunk or something like that it's just a

673
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,120
purpley strain um I think if he would

674
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:53,558
have done the sour d and the glue it

675
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,519
would have been a whole it would have

676
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:56,759
came out a whole lot better in my

677
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:01,079
opinion I think the flavors would have

678
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:03,759
pulled through just that SI s with a

679
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:06,000
uh what was it and Gorilla Glue is

680
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,720
Gorilla Glue is basically a old school

681
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,440
sour or something like that that Gorilla

682
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,798
Glue was a ridiculous plant bro yeah

683
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,038
that is some crazy [ __ ] I've got one

684
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:15,278
growing right now and you got to tie it

685
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,278
down and it will break the tie downs

686
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,679
it's like no I literally had one that

687
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,440
had I think it started with three tops

688
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,360
and I literally just as it would grow

689
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,360
would just super crop each top down and

690
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,918
then now it has like 18 tops I literally

691
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:32,519
have a 10 gallon Gorilla Glue that has

692
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,799
20 stakes in it I'm going to have to uh

693
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:35,158
take a plant out of the room or

694
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:36,599
something because these two gorilla

695
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,840
glues are taking more space than I

696
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,158
completely predicted yeah uh I read who

697
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:42,879
made it the other day on The Forum yeah

698
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,200
yeah yeah and I read the cross too and

699
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,240
I'm not surprised that it's so killer

700
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,960
now that I read it it's uh what is it

701
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,960
