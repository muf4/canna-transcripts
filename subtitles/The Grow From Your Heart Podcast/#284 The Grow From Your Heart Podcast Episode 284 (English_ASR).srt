00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:47,509
inserted and/or applied some

55
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:48,560
suppositories I don't have my notes out

56
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,469
where I can see them but I have it all

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,569
in my head we're gonna talk about is the

58
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:55,129
newcomer and also the provider of the

59
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,019
suppositories oh not you personally your

60
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,819
company we're gonna talk about that tell

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,830
us a little bit about the company and

62
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,079
tell us about suppositories and then

63
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,270
tell me about the dosage that everybody

64
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,980
was just fed my name is Shannon

65
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,480
obviously am French connoisseurs

66
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:10,609
genetics and concentrates is the name of

67
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,009
the company we're based in Denver we are

68
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,470
solvent list company we've got rosin

69
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:17,870
products that's kind of our main our

70
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:20,660
main products but we also carry the

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,610
ancillary products bath bombs you might

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,330
have seen them around town they become

73
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:29,090
very big but our suppositories are just

74
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,879
kind of that silent medication that

75
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:36,049
nobody's talking about but is so highly

76
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:38,629
effective and with the new levels of

77
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,000
chemicals that are allowed and solvents

78
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,189
are in your in your concentrates it's

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,720
just a smarter I mean if you're applying

80
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:46,850
this and you need it for medical reasons

81
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,660
you don't necessarily want those

82
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:52,790
chemicals and balls right so it's it's

83
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,290
just a much better application there's

84
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,970
people who want to be medicated during

85
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,510
the day but can't afford to be high due

86
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:02,150
to their jobs this does not get you high

87
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,860
per se there is a euphoric feeling it's

88
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:06,500
just that you know when you can manage

89
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,229
something symptoms that have been you

90
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:14,750
know killing you it's just nice like

91
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:16,639
it's a euphoric feeling scuse my throat

92
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,990
is right from hanging out well I did not

93
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,789
use this depository tonight but I have

94
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,019
tried one and it euphoric is certainly

95
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,330
one of the words I would use to describe

96
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:25,909
it none of my lower back pain was

97
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:28,668
noticeable after using a suppository it

98
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:31,040
definitely works for that 70 percent

99
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:33,529
absorption rate I mean edibles is thirty

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,819
smoking is approximately 10 so it's the

101
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:37,889
most effective way to get medicine

102
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:44,670
and you guys probably put them in say 30

103
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:54,750
minutes ago ish hardcore let's hear what

104
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:57,509
you did so that means diamond granny is

105
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,459
actually medicated with 100 THC and 100

106
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:03,560
CBD me and Lindsey since we've only done

107
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:06,539
one it's a 50/50 50 P AC 50 CBD but

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:12,470
because we do cater to medical patients

109
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,470
I recently helped a colon cancer patient

110
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:37,519
because that's what his thanks for

111
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,019
coming appreciate it

112
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,899
how many you got for 200 milligrams in

113
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,269
only 100 only hundred okay how long did

114
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:48,239
it take for the first one to kick in

115
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:49,529
maybe 30 to 40 minutes Lindsey do you

116
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,629
notice a difference since you don't go

117
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:54,000
as frequently yeah for sure

118
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:58,379
it definitely kicks in somewhere in the

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,120
in the 30 to 40 minute range it actually

120
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:04,709
probably just kicked in about 10 minutes

121
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,149
ago for me and I really was like you

122
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,319
also took a dad that made you coffee

123
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:21,209
they probably got your blood pressure

124
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:22,409
moving was actually start sort of in

125
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:23,609
your tummy and then it sort of just

126
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,970
spreads out and you can feel the

127
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,980
medicine happen it never got above my

128
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,420
chest region I never I never felt any

129
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,770
medication above that I've got some

130
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,780
shoulder pain from a car accident I

131
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:35,909
never felt it there but my knee pain was

132
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,769
gone my legs were I don't know that I

133
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,330
would want to take it the first two

134
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,069
times and try to go to work my job

135
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,839
involves me on my feet working I'm

136
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:44,730
running laps basically all day I don't

137
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,529
know that my legs would have cooperated

138
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,700
a hundred percent it might have been a

139
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,219
little little too much

140
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:54,240
a day's work and when we first created

141
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:57,090
these suppositories I was making 15

142
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,090
milligram and 25 milligram as well but I

143
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:02,459
think it just got to the point where if

144
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:04,579
you're in that much pain that you're

145
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,079
willing to stick something up your rear

146
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:09,000
it's going to need to be seriously

147
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,209
medicated like I'm not doing it just for

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,740
15 milligrams maybe for 50 I'll go for

149
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:18,739
it everybody's comfortable jumping in

150
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,910
that water do you see

151
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,500
what is your demographic that's using

152
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,270
your product do you see an apprehension

153
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:29,699
from males are they afraid of using your

154
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:31,409
product I get apprehension when like if

155
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm giving out samples and I give out

156
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,479
one to one person they're apprehensive

157
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,070
but if I give to people they will

158
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,320
usually team up and be like yeah I'll do

159
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,450
it if you do it it's not gender specific

160
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,150
all right I think it kind of goes across

161
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,280
the board the you know and really the

162
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:53,990
only thing we've focused on this is the

163
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:57,600
symptoms you know just that sensation

164
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,909
but for women there's an alternate use

165
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,000
as well that's not highly talked about

166
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:06,329
and it makes men cringe is that monthly

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,360
mistress that comes in visits it can be

168
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:12,150
a [ __ ] and if you have endometriosis or

169
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
other things and men look at us and they

170
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,000
know because they've seen their

171
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,310
girlfriends wrench in pain but they

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,929
don't get it like girls actually if you

173
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:21,719
say that they're like it relieves that

174
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:24,089
and they are willing to use it

175
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,639
I'm sure Lindsey can attest to that I

176
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,190
know she suffers from that yeah I

177
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,710
actually I have a very insists which is

178
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,030
why I even have a medical card and you

179
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,680
know I've suffered from it since I was

180
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:40,319
about 16 years old

181
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:42,479
and I truly didn't have full relief from

182
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,300
my pain until I moved to Colorado and I

183
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,190
had tried CBD for the first time even

184
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,809
just dabs like I couldn't believe how

185
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,540
much that had taken away from me and

186
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:53,549
then the first time I ever took a

187
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:54,319
suppository I was in a lot of pain and

188
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:59,149
Gail had given

189
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,970
one of them and I was like Gumby I you

190
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,579
could barely move my bottom legs like I

191
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:38,750
was just like so so did you see your

192
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:41,540
bottom what you say that the medicated

193
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:44,269
feeling kind of comes in waves yeah you

194
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:47,569
might think okay oh that's it it's

195
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:50,539
peaked but no no good 10 hours sometimes

196
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,040
12 hours yeah and and it seems like the

197
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:55,610
medicine knows where to go

198
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:58,370
except for shoulder and neck it goes

199
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,560
past the heart is that's kind of like

200
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,149
you would have to it would have to be

201
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,129
applied differently because the heart's

202
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,019
kind of there like it's running these

203
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:07,669
blood vessels so the animals get to my

204
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:16,370
shoulders if I eat it it goes to my head

205
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:17,779
and shoulders finds the pain it tickles

206
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,980
the pain and massages that out and then

207
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,059
if there's leftovers it goes to your

208
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,710
brain and makes you a little high this

209
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:28,969
way I feel cannabis does or if you

210
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:31,040
consume it is very smart

211
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,120
actually Lindsey texted me I was I was

212
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,349
trying to hang out with Lindsey one day

213
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,720
is like you want to hang out and she's

214
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,399
like hurt so bad I can't even hang out

215
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,139
and I said did you put one of those

216
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,139
suppositories in there and she was like

217
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:49,490
crazy but go ahead and try that she's

218
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,360
like been there done that already I'm

219
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,879
still here bro

220
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,100
I mean I guess in a sense you can say it

221
00:11:53,879 --> 00:12:12,419
gets you high but it's not the mental

222
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:14,040
psychosis one thing we do need to say to

223
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,269
the ladies since you brought it up about

224
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,389
monthly cycles

225
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:20,669
I recommend it all the time but we need

226
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:21,449
to let them know don't be support don't

227
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:24,750
do this

228
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,720
vaginally you can't well you can but if

229
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,730
you think about it your monthly cycle is

230
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,028
to flush things out so if you're gonna

231
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,649
insert that suppository into your vagina

232
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:46,980
you're going to flush the medicine back

233
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:50,970
out not to say you had more membranes in

234
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:55,350
your butt so you might as well go yeah I

235
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:58,170
know there was wasn't hours I didn't

236
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:02,159
have any part in it but I do know that

237
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:05,909
she had had bladder cancer something

238
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:08,909
more on the female area so she used them

239
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:10,259
vaginally and assist was going away with

240
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:12,120
chemo on the outside but they weren't

241
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,698
going away on the inside so by using the

242
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,698
suppository she was able to reduce the

243
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:24,269
ulcers on the inside she wasn't on her

244
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:26,370
cycle when she was exactly right so we

245
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:27,870
probably have all agreed don't don't use

246
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,480
it vaginally when you were on your

247
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,009
period but if you do have an ovarian

248
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,850
cyst maybe put it in there if you're

249
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:37,019
seeking relief and not on your cycle put

250
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,310
it in your butt to get the pain relief

251
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:43,350
you have agree with Jesus I kind of

252
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:46,078
agree with Gail here to be honest with

253
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,769
you I've only ever really put one in my

254
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,349
vagina

255
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:51,179
one or two times every other time that

256
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,940
I've used them which has been about a

257
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:57,629
dozen now has all been in my butt

258
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,140
because oh man there's a lot of reason

259
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:02,158
I'm gonna cut that into a sound right

260
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,158
[Music]

261
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,639
[Music]

262
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:24,370
[Music]

263
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:44,230
[Music]

264
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,810
Shannen maybe we should tell them about

265
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:03,750
the size of the suppositories you know

266
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:05,579
they cringe just just gonna say that you

267
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,779
the other thing I really wanted before I

268
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,470
forget cuz I'm really stoned

269
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:13,199
I like to throw them in the freezer for

270
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,810
about five to ten minutes before I use

271
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,670
it so that way because I'm an idiot and

272
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:19,049
I leave them in when I first get them I

273
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:21,149
leave them in my bag or somewhere and

274
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:23,969
they kind of but not melt but they just

275
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,579
get soft exactly just like her they just

276
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,990
get a little bit soft and I don't you

277
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,030
know I don't want to have any issues any

278
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,680
crumble any breakage so I throw it in

279
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,870
the freezer just so hard knees up just

280
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,120
that tiny bit and then it's super easy

281
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,129
to answer and there's no issues with it

282
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,049
so if you're looking for a super easy

283
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:42,240
way to do it that is my tip for that

284
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:43,769
that is how I I typically store mine in

285
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,779
the refrigerator or the freezer we keep

286
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:47,879
them in the freezer at when I once they

287
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,339
cure and everything and I seal them so

288
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,710
it's definitely you know a cooler

289
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,930
temperature obviously it's we don't use

290
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:58,889
coconut oil and the reason that we don't

291
00:15:54,929 --> 00:16:01,739
and if you if you check any youtubes or

292
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:04,740
any of those type of forums they will

293
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,029
all say use coconut oil well we don't

294
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,740
use coconut oil because there's a lot

295
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,709
people who have allergies to it that

296
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,539
have developed so

297
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:14,990
we try to avoid that we actually use

298
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:17,870
cocoa butter and beeswax and so that's

299
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,250
why ours are a little they stay firm or

300
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,980
even when they're not in the freezer

301
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,750
like some of the others I know because

302
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,129
when they're made out of coconut oil the

303
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,500
second you touch it it starts to melt

304
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:29,840
regardless of how you've stored it so

305
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,919
you know I try to be conscious of all

306
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,149
common allergies and things that may

307
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:37,189
affect patients especially when their

308
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:39,019
immune systems already being compromised

309
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,450
you said you make them out of solvent

310
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,129
list can you can you teach our listeners

311
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,540
that may not know what solvent as hashes

312
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,769
can you give them a quick lesson if you

313
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:49,250
need a hand we'll jump in yeah

314
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:52,460
absolutely thank you I'm actually this

315
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,840
one so depending on what kind of

316
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,269
concentrate we're making we makes

317
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,120
everything is done with either heat and

318
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:01,340
pressure or ice and water we don't use

319
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,870
any chemicals throughout the process I

320
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,069
mean there's solvent free which means

321
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,039
there were solvents used but they've

322
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:08,899
been removed for us we never this

323
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,209
product never touches us all bit okay

324
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,940
even in our grow it's it's as close to

325
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,500
working as you can get you know to get

326
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,230
certified organic cost a lot of money

327
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:22,309
and we're still new so that's in our in

328
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:26,029
our coming days or years probably when

329
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:30,289
we can truly go full organic but with

330
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:34,309
the process uh things are removed so if

331
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:37,549
it's star melt say we we make it into

332
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,710
hash with ice and water okay we've got a

333
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:42,019
hash guy that makes that and then from

334
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,130
there we press that will sift it we get

335
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,680
the truthful amount and we get our

336
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,420
different microns and then from there if

337
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,160
it's not doesn't meet our standards of

338
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:53,539
truthful melt then we press it into

339
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:56,960
rosin and that just is you know that

340
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:59,750
it's a ninety five percent typically THC

341
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,049
level about that and you know we always

342
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,849
have the testing on those and it varies

343
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:07,220
for our nug melt we just take the flour

344
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:10,730
it's all about how you cure it how it's

345
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,829
grown the strains you use are important

346
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,900
right we just take it and it's process

347
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:17,599
down and we just press the flour with

348
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,240
heat and pressure which makes a rosin as

349
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,649
well yeah which is becoming more right a

350
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,029
lot of my listeners might not know so

351
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,720
I'm gonna give him just a bits basically

352
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:26,269
you're taking

353
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,610
a really high-tech George Foreman grill

354
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:30,288
and squishing a bud and a George into a

355
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,269
George Foreman grill and some juice

356
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:35,359
strips out of it and that juice is very

357
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,769
potent I am NOT a huge fan of rosin

358
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,928
smoking by itself because I usually

359
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:41,329
don't like the flavor if it's done right

360
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,019
if it's me if you take hash and make out

361
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,589
of that

362
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:47,950
I don't think squishing the but makes

363
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:51,019
flavorful a lot of people are huge fans

364
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,019
[Music]

365
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:58,400
and that's where the differentiation is

366
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:00,679
with nug melt that means it's not being

367
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,419
done right okay if it's not being done

368
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,850
right and which means it's being exposed

369
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:06,380
to there too long to the heat or too

370
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:12,259
high of a temperature for too long you

371
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:14,210
get that popcorn it's never happened in

372
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,679
our kitchen but if it that happens those

373
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,659
get turned into ancillary products bath

374
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,730
bombs like weed that's not something we

375
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:21,830
would put on the shelf as something we

376
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,380
would say smoke this because it doesn't

377
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:27,500
taste right you know we've really worked

378
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,960
on perfecting the cure in the taste and

379
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,269
when we press it the time and it's a

380
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,798
science so and that's something that

381
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:39,379
we've been really working on for a long

382
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:40,908
time so I I believe there was I think we

383
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,130
had some note here I'll make sure that

384
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:51,230
you actually get to try it I'll prove

385
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:52,880
your popcorn you are 100% correct if it

386
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,259
is not done right that's exactly what it

387
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,610
tastes like it's not like you guys have

388
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,038
mastered the tech so you're taking

389
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:59,928
properly done rosin and then making that

390
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:02,869
into a liquid that's able to be put into

391
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:05,120
the suppositories correct yes

392
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:07,279
it's I have a formulation I know what

393
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,739
calculations to make as far as so to

394
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,379
make potencies and whatnot

395
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,329
and based on how many I'm making it's

396
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:17,210
just its formula and I just take the

397
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:22,788
rosin and in the CBDs and just melt it

398
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:25,279
down within the cocoa butter and correct

399
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:28,490
and you said something about size Gail

400
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,649
and you know sizes

401
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,420
if I said you know the end of your

402
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,090
pinkie that's gonna vary because

403
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,210
everybody's pinkies a different size so

404
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:50,059
they're - it's 2 grams is what it weighs

405
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:52,579
out in amount it's a liquid the size is

406
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,859
a fleet suppository guy me if you've

407
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:56,990
ever used any torque sight type of

408
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:59,000
suppositories the exact same size we're

409
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,549
used buying the same molds from the same

410
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,960
complicated the major players by fast

411
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,629
somebody out there is gonna argue with

412
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,279
us and say that water is a solvent yes

413
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,890
we know water is a solvent but it's not

414
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,420
being used as a we get that but it's

415
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:16,280
being used more as an agitator in this

416
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:18,019
situation still people are haters and so

417
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:19,819
I just want to leave my footnote we get

418
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:22,069
it water is a solvent in this situation

419
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:23,779
it's not the ice is being used is more

420
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:25,159
like a beater to break off the trichome

421
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:33,470
so don't don't get at me because I know

422
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:36,590
someone's gonna say that like the water

423
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:39,259
isn't changing the properties of it

424
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:41,269
whereas like when BHO and Pho is run

425
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:48,259
through an itch physically changes it

426
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:50,660
and chemically changes it right there

427
00:21:48,259 --> 00:22:02,900
because water doesn't change the

428
00:21:50,660 --> 00:22:08,870
chemical properties give that speech

429
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:10,160
because we're talking about the size of

430
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,509
suppositories yes

431

[Music]

432
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:16,460
my favorite word insertion it's not that

433
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,640
bad you guys a lot of dudes a lot of

434
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:24,500
people looking like really bro like they

435
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,030
said you're not putting a dildo you eat

436
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,180
all day you take giant [ __ ] so some

437
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:30,649
things not gonna affect your butt any

438
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,170
poop you've ever thrown out don't be

439
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:36,019
scurred but right there Jeff is what you

440
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,630
men say know that hole is meant for

441
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:41,269
stuff to come out not stuff to go in a

442
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,840
lot of yeah at first when you say

443
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:43,548
suppose it

444
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,459
that's my natural reaction is but then I

445
00:22:43,548 --> 00:22:47,740
think I'm a logical dude I understand

[Music]

447
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:54,859
let's do this it's not so it just

448
00:22:52,329 --> 00:23:12,918
literally you just put it yes you go

449
00:22:54,859 --> 00:23:13,969
like like do you Lindsay no what's the

450
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:26,570
story over here I want to know what I

451
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:28,429
missed how do you how do you know how

452
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:30,678
when it's in right well if you push too

453
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:33,048
far your body pushes it down a little

454
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,788
it's like you don't go far enough it

455
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:38,418
falls out it's called that second

456
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:41,058
speaker muscles really you know it's

457
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:43,509
comfortably right in one spot okay kind

458
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:50,990
of you know it's there but yeah yeah

459
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:53,179
it's gonna sound crazy but I mean I'll

460
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,190
just say this as long as you get it

461
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:58,070
completely in you can kind of like

462
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,870
squeeze your butt cheeks and push it the

463
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,819
rest of the way without needing to get

464
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:06,889
no closer it'll kind of like itself

465
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:08,928
where it squeamish about your butthole

466
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,309
you can just like get it all the way in

467
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:12,288
there physically and then you can just

468
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:13,970
use your own butt cheeks to just squeeze

469
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:17,419
it in there and then wash your hands

470
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,669
before you come take please let me

471
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:22,490
dispose it is important since you are

472
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:26,450
possibly inserting your finger you do

473
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:28,429
want to wash your hands before you just

474
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,019
say that because they'll be like oh

475
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:33,798
we're supposed to wash my hands before

476
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:36,319
too you know yeah we're not all savages

477
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:38,519
wash your hands ladies and gentlemen

478
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,859
all right I'm gonna bring up another

479
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,019
thing that maybe people are squeamish to

480
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:45,299
talk about but I do get asked this to it

481
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:46,799
what about leakage okay see I'm glad you

482
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,059
said that because that's exactly what I

483
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,190
was gonna say earlier when we got

484
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:54,750
derailed and I minimize guys majorly

485
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:56,789
talking medicating here might be and if

486
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,980
you're 15 years old then don't listen to

487
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:00,750
us this is we are truly talking about

488
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:05,910
medicating here and it's not all gonna

489
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:08,339
be suppository talk this is gonna sound

490
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,890
crazy but like I mean like I don't put

491
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:13,079
them in vaginally because I am always

492
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,480
afraid that like I'm gonna take a DAB

493
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:30,960
afterwards and cause really hard or like

494
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:33,089
bright and like juice and like I mean

495
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,920
it's not like a super big like fear of

496
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:51,509
mine I mean out of my vagina

497
00:25:37,920 --> 00:26:38,880
I actually don't use them that way cuz

498
00:25:51,509 --> 00:26:41,150
I'm super afraid of dr. pepper and good

499
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,150
friends

[Music]

502
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:24,298
neither with either one of them it's

503
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:26,399
possible because it's so if that happens

504
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:34,679
like it's not the end of the world wash

505
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:37,380
your clothes wash your underwear there

506
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:41,160
should not be any leakage now I have yet

507
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:49,910
to have any any no potato tips that have

508
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:52,048
given me worse side effects then I

509
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:56,160
really couldn't say that there's any

510
00:27:52,048 --> 00:28:01,079
super negative side effects that stand

511
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,009
out to me there's a random question if

512
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,210
somebody gets a hold of these and they

513
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,669
don't have the proper labeling and they

514
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,940
eat one what's gonna go wrong nothing

515
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:11,299
but it's basically 50 milligrams THC and

516
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,730
50 milligrams CBD is gonna be processed

517
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:16,319
and stomach so you are probably going to

518
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,150
get a head high and not feel a lot of

519
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,509
pain relief it's going to be a different

520
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:25,440
high it's cocoa butter and it's beeswax

521
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:27,839
it's but we do ask that you be

522
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,000
responsible Medicaid errs and keep these

523
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:34,379
products away from your children yes yes

524
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,650
what uh what type of kid I was gonna ask

525
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:41,910
could we use these for our pets we just

526
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,410
had so I'm gonna go with another

527
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,410
question what are what

528
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:57,720
ladies had a conversation about a

529
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,340
documentary where people were having sex

530
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,920
with their farm animals I did not bring

531
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:04,019
it up I didn't start these ladies did

532
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,970
this to us what I was gonna ask really

533
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:07,829
though was what type of conditions would

534
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,329
you recommend like if you had just a

535
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,829
list of conditions and if you're like

536
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:15,329
suppositories we'll fix that what would

537
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:19,649
you go for first pain in any kind of you

538
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:29,460
know symptoms that you have where relief

539
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:32,550
I would say I'm gonna say anybody can I

540
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,710
use my own personal best ways to

541
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:37,440
describe things I took a year and I

542
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:40,380
weaned my husband off opioids with the

543
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,170
help of these suppositories oh wow okay

544
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:47,270
I'm with CBDs and suppositories Kevin is

545
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:50,250
now opioid free Congrats Kevin wasn't he

546
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:52,799
he will smoke but he didn't want to do

547
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:55,380
suppositories he didn't want to do CBDs

548
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,289
he he's an old hippie he'll smoke his

549
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:03,450
bowls okay but at the beginning of 2016

550
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:06,710
he was on 75 micrograms of fentanyl

551
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:10,380
which was to be changed every 72 hours

552
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:14,610
40 milligrams of extended-release

553
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:18,450
morphine two times a day 15 milligrams

554
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:22,189
of immediate-release morphine five times

555
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:26,920
a day as needed so he was basically

556
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,920
[Music]

557
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,099
that's when Jen and I first met I was

558
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,589
like I can't do this and she was like

559
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:37,289
well I'll help you she gave me some

560
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:40,109
products she gave me those suppositories

561
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:42,779
at first he said you stick that up your

562
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:44,129
butt I said are you kidding after 45

563
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,769
years of marriage you're gonna tell me

564
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:50,440
that are you kidding me stick this

565
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:55,009
little pinky thing compared to something

566
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:57,259
so I said okay if I do it you have to do

567
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:59,240
it I did it he did it and he's like

568
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:01,190
you're right they're not so bad if I

569
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,230
remember correctly it was he and had a

570
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,880
colonoscopy that day so you were like

571
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,099
you've already had it stretched out you

572
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:16,130
might as well just go for it it's

573
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:18,199
already inflated and they work so he is

574
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:21,530
someone that is in a lot of chronic pain

575
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,779
I mean those look to be prescribed that

576
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:25,460
much morphine to begin with absolutely

577
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:27,559
are those the coins it looks like a

578
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,990
quarter what the morphine pills

579
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:32,690
um no they're actually very small okay

580
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,279
and then you know then the government

581
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,680
has gotten to the point also where

582
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,869
they're like oh we're gonna take all

583
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,529
these pills for ten years and now we're

584
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:44,269
gonna take them away from you yes and

585
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:46,369
then we have people going out onto the

586
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:48,819
streets and they're buying them and

587
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:51,199
we're getting more heroin addicts now

588
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:54,169
because heroin is cheaper than pills on

589
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,569
the street so guys I'm telling you

590
00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:00,320
cannabis it I'll tell you if you have an

591
00:31:56,569 --> 00:32:03,109
opioid addiction these suppositories

592
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:06,099
help you get rid of it cuz when you

593
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:09,949
start kicking opioid you get sick yeah

594
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:13,689
even if you try to wean slowly you get

595
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:15,890
sick your body missing it you've been

596
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,650
right yeah but your body doesn't know

597
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,430
that yet so yeah well congrats - is he

598
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,560
still as grumpy

599
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,299
yeah alright but he's gone to Vegas with

600
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,069
me live up to his name well do we want

601
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:32,119
to brag about that for a second are we

602
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:34,960
finished let's keep talking about why so

603
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:36,739
obviously I mean any kind of lower

604
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,819
extremities I would say anywhere from

605
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:43,549
you know the heart down you could you

606
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:45,439
could find relief in some way it just

607
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:47,299
depends on what your symptoms are I mean

608
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,360
there's because it's a one-to-one ratio

609
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:53,720
50/50 THC and CBD you're getting the

610
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:56,509
benefits of both so it it's just it's

611
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,029
the to catalyze each other it's just

612
00:32:56,509 --> 00:33:01,369
overall beneficial I mean I the list

613
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:02,779
could go on and on but I mean for me

614
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:06,289
personally it's nerve damage

615
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:09,319
sciatic nerve issues I was almost

616
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:11,990
paralyzed in a jet ski accident so you

617
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:13,700
know it flares up from time to time and

618
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,039
it swells up so and that's what I use

619
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,529
them okay girls obviously use them for

620
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:23,559
endometriosis cancer patients use that

621
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:27,069
to relieve symptoms you know from their

622
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:30,799
cancer okay whatever it might be I mean

623
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:32,599
cancer if you're on chemo yeah you're

624
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,639
probably really nauseous and what are

625
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,269
they gonna do they're gonna give you a

626
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,840
pharmaceuticals they're gonna give you a

627
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:40,160
kite rail zofran there's all these pills

628
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:41,419
they're gonna give you so you don't get

629
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,490
sick well guess what

630
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,039
you don't need those pills you can

631
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,750
insert one of these suppositories it's

632
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:49,670
going to help with the nauseousness it's

633
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,769
going to help with the pain it's not

634
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,570
going to cure your cancer that's not

635
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:55,519
what we're saying but it will make the

636
00:33:53,569 --> 00:34:01,509
quality of of what you're going through

637
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,509
at that time better it'll make I think

638
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:08,360
that's why that's why I'm such an

639
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,570
advocate for this I mean you know the

640
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:14,329
70% absorption rate is huge when you

641
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:17,210
smoke things it's about a 10% when you

642
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:19,940
eat it it's 30% so they're getting 70

643
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:23,599
percent of that 5050 and that's a huge

644
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,909
amount quickly lasts for quite a long

645
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,980
time I don't know when I take dad's it

646
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:31,640
may be good 30 40 minute buzz out of it

647
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:33,710
but well you know the lingering part

648
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:40,069
about 15 minutes of are is cool but then

649
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:43,490
you just seem to last a long time yeah

650
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,169
the waves go yeah the waves yeah the

651
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:46,699
waves are fun I noticed that for sure

652
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,469
for sure I was thinking maybe I would

653
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,239
take them if I had to go on a plane ride

654
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:51,678
or a car trip where I'm sitting for a

655
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,359
long time because my lower back and my

656
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,039
knees start to get mad about that so it

657
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,360
might be cool to have those on a plane

658
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,550
trip or something where I'm cramped in

659
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,840
the car I have that same like any time

660
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,030
I'm sitting for a long time and I Drive

661
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:05,420
a lot just with calling on dispensaries

662
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:07,130
and just writing the word out so I I

663
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,720
don't typically do it while I'm driving

664
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,700
just because like you said it kind of

665
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,730
deadened like I want to have my reaction

666
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:15,608
times but as soon as I stopped or

667
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:22,400
you know at the end of the day and

668
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:24,650
taking them further computer time yeah

669
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,480
it sounds perfect all right I like it

670
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:34,548
it's a good product you guys all have

671
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:37,369
the same look on your face what other

672
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:41,179
products do you carry though at CGC yeah

673
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:44,180
we also one of our highest things that

674
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:46,098
we've been been popular have been our

675
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:47,358
bath bombs they have we have three

676
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:51,200
different kinds there's a hundred

677
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,730
milligram THC with 15 CBD again we've

678
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,558
got the solvent listen they're okay

679
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,500
they're foaming bath bombs so they have

680
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:00,769
the experience there's actually bubbles

681
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,960
involved colors colors are involved not

682
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:05,599
we don't heavily color them again wanna

683
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,970
keep it as clean as possible but there

684
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,109
is a color in there of course

685
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:11,750
differentiate scents and things like

686
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:16,179
that lavender and citrus ginger and I

687
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:19,010
know granny when I offered her products

688
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:21,919
she loves herself Atlas caviar loves the

689
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:25,790
suppositories obviously you know

690
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:35,000
definitely dabs are rosin but she was

691
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:37,219
like yeah I'm not a bath person so

692
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,769
recently she she caught a cold and I saw

693
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:41,689
her on Facebook or Instagram on one of

694
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:44,210
her live feeds and I was heading down

695
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,309
this way so I just I dropped some stuff

696

off at one of her epic remedies one of

697
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:51,609
the local dispensaries that we do

698
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:56,260
business with and I know shops there and

699
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:56,259
we all do yeah I was just gonna say that

700
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:00,500
[Music]

701
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:02,059
I just dropped it off in texture and I

702
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,800
said I know you're not a bath person but

703
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:15,679
this will make you feel better and I

704
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:24,260
dropped they were wonderful relaxed I

705
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:30,649
was down with just my nose that's how

706
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:34,080
long I've done very cool I love watching

707
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:37,190
the girls on Instagram and YouTube the

708
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,190
[Music]

709
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:41,829
bath is more painful than it's worth

710
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:48,839
[Music]

711
00:37:49,900 --> 00:38:24,079
just because I know they have out there

712
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:27,289
what we need is a shower essential oils

713
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,809
and a few other things that bind it

714
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:31,519
together and make it pretty so naked

715
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:34,519
foam how much of the cannabinoids does

716
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,509
your skin develop develop that's nothing

717
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,780
what I wanted but I think you know what

718
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:42,770
I meant

719
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:46,180
yeah okay I've ruined everybody nobody

720
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:46,179
can find a granny and help us out

721
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,749
[Music]

722
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:58,099
there's no science that has I could

723
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,980
quote that I would feel comfortable

724
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:03,529
saying it's this kind of percentage

725
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:05,240
just from everything I mean your skin is

726
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,280
your largest organ right so it's

727
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:09,409
obviously when you get in a tub of hot

728
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,510
water it's absorbing a we know epsom

729
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:15,349
salts and those so it's just collecting

730
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:17,600
on and absorbing into your skin people

731
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:19,039
the effects that they have had is they

732
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:24,019
say that it's the best night's sleep

733
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:26,440
ever has you know I pulled my back I

734
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:38,929
took a bath in the next morning they

735
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:58,130
were able to you know I I believe in my

736
00:39:38,929 --> 00:40:01,460
opinion that you know issues oils in

737
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:17,358
there essential oils as farce but

738
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:19,130
there's so all those things like they're

739
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:23,000
all made just a little bit different and

740
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:25,490
specifically but so yeah I mean it's

741
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,170
just those oils carry the cabinet's into

742
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,849
the skin all right so there's definitely

743
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,400
an absorption but to give you an exact

744
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:33,679
quote on percentage I have no scientific

745
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,570
see you think just personally do you

746
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,889
think somebody that did not smoke or

747
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:38,960
consume edibles or anything would they

748
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:41,809
pass a drug test from using a bath bomb

749
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,269
I don't know but we could probably find

750
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:45,650
a candidate to test you know somebody

751
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:52,759
that doesn't smoke they do you want to

752
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:55,130
drop a bomb on I have some curious

753
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:58,220
friends that are not cannabis consumers

754
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,800
that because again there's no high to it

755
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:04,399
you're not actually is there any key in

756
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,550
it at all from the CBD that your your

757
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:12,010
skin will absorb well yeah I mean that's

758
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:12,010
right THC one to see if they right yeah

759
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:32,929
you can buy a test at the grocery store

760
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:38,600
right I know one person that will be

761
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:39,049
down for it but I'll report back there

762
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,339
you go

763
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,850
that sounds fun if you can't find one

764
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,230
let me know cuz I know I'm very curious

765
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:50,179
because you said the skins largest organ

766
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:58,099
if our lungs take in so much right

767
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:59,599
hopefully hopefully all topicals I mean

768
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:04,730
they wouldn't work if it if our skin

769
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:07,868
bresenham's or pray excellent sources of

770
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:10,760
pain really especially in specific okay

771
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:13,608
do you have a topical a SAP

772
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,830
no that's that's out there you know I'm

773
00:42:13,608 --> 00:42:18,980
not trying to recreate the wheel with

774
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:22,400
this company like our goal is to find

775
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,550
new inventive ways and connoisseur grade

776
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,619
type products but like we're not that

777
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,900
much more expensive than the big guys

778
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:31,400
that are doing BHO but so for a few

779
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,559
dollars more you can have something

780
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,800
that's completely clean if that's your

781
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:36,559
choice

782
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:42,019
I personally have smoked Vito I'm not

783
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:44,329
gonna be a snob like I've I'm not sick

784
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:45,739
and I don't have cancer so I can't make

785
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:47,779
that decision for somebody who might

786
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:50,509
have a more serious condition right for

787
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,580
me it doesn't affect me so I'm willing

788
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:55,040
to take that risk somebody else might

789
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:58,539
not want to have to take that risk so we

790
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:01,039
want to offer those people a solution so

791
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:05,449

mall speed this to pay the same amount

807
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:39,519
of money or you can pay the same amount

808
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:42,369
of money and you can get it with

809
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,440
cannabis in it and it still equally has

810
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,809
all those effects but you'll get

811
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,070
additional effects if you have a need

812
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:54,789
for it that's awesome you can smell like

813
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:56,320
strawberries and watermelons so what

814
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:58,179
type of price point do the suppository

815
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,650
go for if somebody wants to think about

816
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:01,449
doing this I know you're not the

817
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:07,930
dispensary you're the distributor maker

818
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:15,189
so I want to say right around $16 that's

819
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:18,429
very affordable okay yeah exactly it's

820
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:20,260
all about what kind of what do you need

821
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:21,909
the medicine for like you know for

822
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:27,070
somebody who doesn't have pain buying a

823
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:29,170
topical why would you buy a topical

824
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,360
that's a South so it's all about

825
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,610
application and what you need it for in

826
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,740
my personal opinion is where you're

827
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:37,840
willing to spend your money do you know

828
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,399
of dispensaries in the Colorado Springs

829
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:54,220
Denver area where people can grab these

830
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:57,430
absolutely one of our favorite

831
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:59,529
dispensaries oh yeah for sure I actually

832
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:02,230
just swung through there right before we

833
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,120
did the podcast and I picked up a whole

834
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,400
bunch of dabble products from them we

835
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,980
grabbed it was so funny we went in there

836
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,110
earlier this morning and we walked in

837
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,050
and shout out to dusty in there because

838
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,059
dusty was like drop happening later come

839
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:18,940
back I was like cool so I just picked up

840
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:21,489
a syringe and I think I grabbed like a

841
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,240

842
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:24,429

you look like it looked it looked pretty

844
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:29,259
good in the container which is why I

845
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:31,659
scooped it but man when you open it

846
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,390
it is that's it right there it look

847
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:38,199

all the way from Scotland

1013
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:21,329
I got a care package yesterday of

1014
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:22,079
edibles and t-shirts from Glasgow

1015

Scotland

1016
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:27,809
now I opened them up and everybody was

1017
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:29,460
like God tell you what they're edibles

1018
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:31,528

1019

marshmallow thing looked amazing it

1020
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:36,179
looked very dense but man it was amazing

1021
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:38,639
it wasn't heavy it was good I'm just

1022
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:40,528
glad that it was only THC we joked about

1023
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,239
some of us maybe be having possible

1024
00:55:40,528 --> 00:55:44,039
other I've still got these little

1025
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,679
chocolate not chocolate EES hard candies

1026
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,420
they are pineapple chunks made with Sour

1027
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:50,909
Diesel cannabis they're 50 milligrams

1028
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:54,180
per bag two point five milligrams per

1029
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:57,670
cube the cubes are small oh and they

1030
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:59,889
remind me of semester land I got on fish

1031
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:02,289
so I was very apprehensive to eat these

1032
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:06,190
I did not eat any all of my friends a DD

1033
00:56:02,289 --> 00:56:08,109
fen seemed to be okay they smell good

1034
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:13,420
but they look those little squares look

1035
00:56:08,108 --> 00:56:18,518
very suspicious to me I mean that you

1036
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:21,010
would be eating th the edibles and you

1037
00:56:18,518 --> 00:56:22,899
know I gotta say they have really big

1038
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:25,150
balls in Scotland because not only did

1039
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:28,480
they ship this to her but they had it

1040
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:33,190
labeled right in their sweets and

1041
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:38,380
t-shirts so then I said to him well I

1042
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:40,960
want to know what does the said third

1043
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,358
true Scotsman like me nothing its balls

1044
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,889
in the wind

1045
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:45,769
so these edibles were made by a dude not

1046
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:48,879
wearing any underwear

1047
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,880
[Music]

1048
00:56:52,980 --> 00:57:03,400
we should probably send him back a care

1049
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:11,739
package I am not messing with something

1050
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:14,380
from Glasgow Scotland it sounds like it

1051
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:16,118
now these guys have a like it's like a

1052
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,009
six foot bong if you're on Instagram

1053
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:19,660
yeah you can tell the whole story too if

1054
00:57:18,009 --> 00:57:21,490
you can't okay

1055
00:57:19,659 --> 00:57:26,920
um if you're on Instagram you will see

1056
00:57:21,489 --> 00:57:29,889
this big six-foot bong and I will say it

1057
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:32,500
looks kind of appealing and it's metal

1058
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:34,328
and crystal and it's called Stanley kind

1059
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:38,250
of like Flat Stanley it's supposed to

1060
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:42,009
travel around to different weed people

1061
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:44,139
and um I had messaged this company not

1062
00:57:42,009 --> 00:57:46,240
knowing anything about him saying well

1063
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:49,058
Ken Stanley come to my house to review

1064
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:50,709
and they said yes he could and then a

1065
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:53,769
couple months later they said granny

1066
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:55,000
wheat we can't secure Stanley I said

1067
00:57:53,768 --> 00:57:56,669
what do you mean you can't secure

1068
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,219
Stanley

1069
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:03,690
they said well we'll get back to you so

1070
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:06,359
a month ago they say to me granny custom

1071
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:08,639
grow 420 has Stanley and he won't

1072
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:11,610
respond to us he will not give Stanley

1073
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:13,739
back so custom grow is holding Stanley

1074
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:16,920
hostage he likes Stanley he's not gonna

1075
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:18,750
give Stanley back well that probably is

1076
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,909
no big deal if your company here in the

1077
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:24,480
United States I just go fine customer

1078
00:58:20,909 --> 00:58:28,679
zero 420 these guys are in Slovakia

1079
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:34,829
which is the former Czechoslovakia so

1080
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:38,039
there's no chasing I can't find custom

1081
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:40,230
girl 420 but I'll tell everybody this

1082
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:42,239
story we can tell everybody that follows

1083
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:44,280
all of us on Twitter and they listen to

1084
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,429
this podcast to send a message to custom

1085
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,710

1086
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:54,919

1087
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:59,659

1089
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:05,759
Czechoslovakian crystal Bohemian crystal

1090
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:08,039
how tall would you say it is from the

1091
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:11,220
table well that's 24 inches tall

1092
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:14,519
probably easily easily because if I

1093
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:17,250
stand up the mouthpiece is right where

1094

1096
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:26,280
bong and I really liked it but I was

1097
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:31,160

1100
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:42,659
Instagram it's real bubbly

1101
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:44,130
that perk is like so it's just a shape

1102
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:47,789
of it for us you told us how it looks

1103
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:50,940
kind of like a big crystal liter 2-liter

1104
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:53,969
bottle okay you bother and then there's

1105
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:55,800
this metal perk that and it's all done

1106
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:58,049
on the lathe they have a video up where

1107
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,789
you can actually see them making it cuz

1108
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:02,310
I know people are like ooh I don't want

1109
00:59:59,789 --> 01:00:05,219
to smoke on the middle I'm an old hippie

1110
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:08,610
you smoked out a way worse yeah and

1111
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:10,529
guess what I still use a bit like not

1112
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:12,150
out meet you

1113
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:14,609
don't bring your hip way toward me I

1114
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:16,050
can't get you can't get your bow hot

1115
01:00:14,608 --> 01:00:17,639
enough to fill your lungs it's gonna

1116
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,960
light the hem quick with the lighter and

1117
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:23,789
then light my ball with the hip flick

1118
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:26,820
and then shake that's too many damn

1119
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:29,489
things get a lighter and smoke a ball so

1120
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:31,260
it's like a three litre bottle with this

1121
01:00:29,489 --> 01:00:33,659
perk and then there's this great big

1122
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,300
tall piece that comes up off the top

1123
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:39,509
that you fill with ice gives hella rips

1124
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:44,609
but it's not really practical

1125
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:46,920
I mean it's heavy so once you put it

1126
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:51,420
down somewhere it should States oh okay

1127
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:56,369
it looks really heavy it's not and that

1128
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:58,139
crystal is thick so I mean I think it's

1129
01:00:56,369 --> 01:01:00,450
kind of cool I got a bomb they should do

1130
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:03,179
to you from Slovakia yes that's awesome

1131
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:06,079
and then they thought I spoke Slovakian

1132
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:09,299
cuz I was trying to be nice and I

packaging so much garbage is what I call

01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:36,039
million house but when we pulled up in a

1325
01:12:33,489 --> 01:12:39,168
new hall and those people were on the

1326
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:41,149
dock and I opened it up and she went

1327
01:12:39,168 --> 01:12:43,219
and I got out of the truck and I came up

1328
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:46,489
and I said I wasn't going to tell you

1329
01:12:43,219 --> 01:12:48,788
until I got here but this all came from

1330
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:52,549
the cannabis community and she goes

1331
01:12:48,788 --> 01:12:54,708
where did you get all this food and I

1332
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:56,809
said all the food and there's toys in

1333
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:58,998
there there's money in there and it all

1334
01:12:56,809 --> 01:13:01,849
came from dispensaries I'm getting my

1335
01:12:58,998 --> 01:13:06,139
hair in your face it made me so happy

1336
01:13:01,849 --> 01:13:09,918
and she was like you guys really made a

1337
01:13:06,139 --> 01:13:14,599
difference so we had a u-haul truck from

1338
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:18,229
ceiling to floor front to back full food

1339
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:22,880
toys there was some brand new kids hats

1340
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:24,619
gloves lots of new toys yes and then

1341
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,300
when I spoke with the lady I was so

1342
01:13:24,618 --> 01:13:27,589
impressed with this program and it's all

1343
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:29,899
through the Marian house Catholic

1344
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:35,929
Charities if you're not religious I

1345
01:13:29,899 --> 01:13:37,639
don't care do you know what I mean by

1346
01:13:35,929 --> 01:13:39,918
guerrilla chefs those metal show yes

1347
01:13:37,639 --> 01:13:43,090
yeah they had several of those different

1348
01:13:39,918 --> 01:13:45,439
categories and they have a lot of

1349
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:47,899
displaced families they're trying to get

1350
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:49,969
back on track the parents have to take

1351
01:13:47,899 --> 01:13:51,979
parenting classes which I think that's

1352
01:13:49,969 --> 01:13:53,989
good that's good because if you're young

1353
01:13:51,979 --> 01:13:56,449
you know I was young and dumb once do

1354
01:13:53,988 --> 01:13:58,248
you need help and we get a lot of people

1355
01:13:56,448 --> 01:13:59,988
coming here because of the cannabis

1356
01:13:58,248 --> 01:14:02,389
community and they don't have a plan

1357
01:13:59,988 --> 01:14:05,178
they don't have a solid plan in place

1358
01:14:02,389 --> 01:14:07,069
and sometimes kids get supper anyway

1359
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:09,618
these guerrilla chefs have brand new

1360
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:10,668
toys and if it's kids birthday they get

1361
01:14:09,618 --> 01:14:12,168
to come in and they get to pick

1362
01:14:10,668 --> 01:14:15,319
brand-new toys that's pretty awesome

1363
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:16,849
they had so many brand new diapers you

1364
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:19,009
can go down there and get if you need

1365
01:14:16,849 --> 01:14:20,689
diapers people you can go down to the

1366
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:26,449
Marian house and get diapers there's no

1367
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:28,130
questions asked diapers irks so I just

1368
01:14:26,448 --> 01:14:30,078
felt yes we did make a big difference

1369
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:32,149
thank you for bringing that out okay

1370
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:33,438
that seems like an eternity ago it was a

1371
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:34,550
while ago but thank you for doing it

1372
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:35,269

yeah really happy know that we helped

1375
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:45,408
little kids faces when they little kids

1376
01:14:42,349 --> 01:14:46,519
know they can see it their parents don't

1377
01:14:45,408 --> 01:14:47,670
tell them but they know we live in a

1378
01:14:46,519 --> 01:14:49,770
thing and we are getting

1379
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:51,359
it's not gonna be cool present and

1380
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:54,139
they're like oh my god I got a

1381
01:14:51,359 --> 01:15:05,670
five-dollar dinosaur that made my day

1382
01:14:54,139 --> 01:15:07,139
and kids have to be punished for sure I

1383
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:09,239
want to give a big shout out to Bailey

a couple days a week off and I'm sure

1395
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:58,679
she has conditions that you know make it

1396
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:00,270
hard for her to stay mobile sometimes

1397
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:10,590

about the show because of metal Damian

01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:38,619
um so he he's on the show all the time

1519
01:23:34,988 --> 01:23:40,058
because it's filmed in Miami and so I

1520
01:23:38,618 --> 01:23:41,348
said yeah absolutely so then he messaged

1521
01:23:40,059 --> 01:23:42,219
me at the beginning of the month and

1522
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,770
he's like oh I'm gonna be out there on

1523
01:23:42,219 --> 01:23:47,020
the 15th and 16th and I said Coolio so

1524
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,820
we get there and I really I just watched

1525
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:50,679
the show so I know that the way the show

1526
01:23:48,819 --> 01:23:53,710
goes is you sit in front of a really

1527
01:23:50,679 --> 01:23:55,690
bright light you wear sunglasses and you

1528
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:58,750
smoke either like a joint or a blunt or

1529
01:23:55,689 --> 01:23:59,618
something and he asks you questions and

1530
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,599
you just answer I mean like the

1531
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:06,279
questions are you know in the bottom of

1532
01:24:01,599 --> 01:24:07,630
the of the like screen so I just knew

1533
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:09,309
that we were gonna get asked questions

1534
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,599
and honestly he had put up a picture

1535
01:24:09,309 --> 01:24:11,770
that morning and he had tagged a bunch

1536
01:24:10,599 --> 01:24:14,078
of people so I didn't really know how

1537
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:16,690
how it goes so he doesn't let anybody

1538
01:24:14,078 --> 01:24:19,689
like be around each other when they get

1539
01:24:16,689 --> 01:24:22,319
taped and if you're on the same episode

1540
01:24:19,689 --> 01:24:25,299
and like you can get be in the same room

1541
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:28,689
so we get there he goes oh your episodes

1542
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:30,579

1543
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:38,799

you were looking for out of this you it

1546
01:24:43,179 --> 01:24:46,179

1547
01:24:44,408 --> 01:24:47,589
newlywed game style kind of like we

1548
01:24:46,179 --> 01:24:49,389
didn't even stay in the room with each

1549
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:51,670
other and he asked us pretty much the

1550
01:24:49,389 --> 01:24:54,190
same questions and like to see how we

1551
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:55,809
answer him and it was pretty comical to

1552
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:57,729
be honest with you like I'm super stoked

1553
01:24:55,809 --> 01:25:00,670

1563
01:25:19,479 --> 01:25:23,559
I mean just I don't want to spoil our

1564
01:25:21,729 --> 01:25:25,029
episode so I'll tell you what's been on

1565
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,980
other episodes and it was really funny

1566
01:25:25,029 --> 01:25:28,869
because I I was at the can of Canyon a

1567
01:25:26,979 --> 01:25:33,099
couple days before so you're gonna spoil

1568
01:25:28,869 --> 01:25:36,039
somebody else's up to season one it's

1569
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:38,260
already up it's on YouTube okay yeah so

1570
01:25:36,039 --> 01:25:40,149
I was at the can of Canyon the other day

1571
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:41,710
and I was showing Camille like the day I

1572
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:42,909
was like yo look at what I get to go

1573
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:44,230
into the other day like I'm kinda me

1574
01:25:42,909 --> 01:25:46,659
said she was the only person I don't

1575
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:47,829
even tell granny like granny called me

1576
01:25:46,659 --> 01:25:49,389
on the way up and she said what are you

1577
01:25:47,829 --> 01:25:50,829
doing and I was like okay I'm going do

1578
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:51,940
this really cool thing but I was showing

1579
01:25:50,829 --> 01:25:54,039
Camille this never is really funny

1580
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:56,799
because the question was ice cream or

1581
01:25:54,039 --> 01:26:01,359
anal and the amount of like guys that

1582
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:05,140
chose ice cream was insane like it was

1583
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:06,849
so fun yeah and it was just mind-blowing

1584
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:08,110
to me and me and camera both like I

1585
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:09,340
can't believe how many people are saying

1586
01:26:08,109 --> 01:26:10,750
ice cream right now like this is

1587
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:12,310
actually insane to me

1588
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:20,289
maybe they thought they had to receive

1589
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:21,280
instead of give like so some of the

1590
01:26:20,289 --> 01:26:24,399
questions are like what's your favorite

1591
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:26,019
strain you know like so yeah it's just

1592
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:27,579
really funny because he just asks you

1593
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:28,989
these like question he doesn't ask them

1594
01:26:27,579 --> 01:26:30,340
in a certain order like there's no like

1595
01:26:28,988 --> 01:26:32,049
what's your name

1596
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:34,810
where you from like it's not like a

1597
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:36,579
gradual thing it's what's your name ice

1598
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:38,110
cream or anal what's your favorite

1599
01:26:36,579 --> 01:26:40,269
strain like you know what I mean like

1600
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:48,729
it's so back and forth like that so

1601
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:51,790

cake and there was a specific section of

1664
01:32:43,829 --> 01:32:47,969
cake with no bacon and so they were

1665

you're not gonna overdose on cannabis

1694
01:34:40,969 --> 01:34:44,270
the only way you can die from cannabis

1695
01:34:42,649 --> 01:34:46,309
is if a ton of it falls on your head and

1696
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:48,679
kills you and that's if you're eating a

1697
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:50,600
pound and it lodges in your throat I

1698
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:51,920
mean but who's gonna really or if the

1699
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:54,170
cops kick in your door and kill you for

1700
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,670
having it that way that's the problem

1701
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:56,329
with cannabis police are more dangerous

1702
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:58,510

back in episode called follow your nose

1929
01:51:24,829 --> 01:51:28,670
and I talked about Sour Diesel and

1930
01:51:27,170 --> 01:51:30,500
Hispanic folks I felt like I may be a

1931
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:33,140
bit racist calling about calling out the

1932
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:34,609
folks of Latin descent for liking Sour

1933
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:36,920
Diesel but I felt that was something

1934
01:51:34,609 --> 01:51:37,399
that I noticed and my friend Mountain

1935
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:39,289
smokes

1936
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:41,929
on snapchat sent me a message she said

1937
01:51:39,289 --> 01:51:43,880
oh my gosh the Sour Diesel bits so true

1938
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:46,460
being from Gunnison County another

1939
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:48,170
heavily populated area Sour Diesel has

1940
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:50,090
always been growing in the basements and

1941
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:52,489
it was by far the most popular strain I

1942
01:51:50,090 --> 01:51:54,560

01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:53,710
scale cultivation site and we have been

1973
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:56,290
fighting powdery mmm

1976
01:52:58,869 --> 01:53:03,939
and I'm starting to tap out it's indoor

1977
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:05,469

five on Instagram follow him if he wants

1985
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:22,060
you alright let's talk a little bit

1986
01:53:20,289 --> 01:53:24,130
about your powdery mildew situation

1987
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:26,410
there are a lot of things we can spray

1988
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:28,480
and things we can do to help treat and

1989
01:53:26,409 --> 01:53:30,369
correct this problem but what I'm mainly

1990
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:31,988
concerned with is why is it there how

1991
01:53:30,369 --> 01:53:34,840
did it show up in the first place and is

1992
01:53:31,988 --> 01:53:36,909
it going to come back since you say

1993
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:39,130
you've sprayed [ __ ] everything it

1994
01:53:36,909 --> 01:53:41,139
makes me think that you have issues with

1995
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:42,670
the room obviously there is not enough

1996
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:44,440
airflow you're not getting rid of the

1997
01:53:42,670 --> 01:53:46,960
old air you're not bringing in enough

1998
01:53:44,439 --> 01:53:49,089
fresh air possibly there are temperature

1999
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:51,159
fluctuations there are a lot of things

2000
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:53,079
like that that are going to be causing

2001
01:53:51,159 --> 01:53:55,510
problems are you running a hydro grow or

2002
01:53:53,079 --> 01:53:56,920
a soil grow if it's hydro you've got a

2003
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:59,530
lot of water in there you're gonna have

2004
01:53:56,920 --> 01:54:01,270
to control the temperature if it's hydro

2005
01:53:59,529 --> 01:54:02,829
you may need to get some chillers and

2006
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:05,140
cool the water because that'll prevent

2007
01:54:02,829 --> 01:54:06,969
the water from becoming a vapor which

2008
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:09,460
becomes humidity which promotes the

2009
01:54:06,969 --> 01:54:11,050
powdery mildew if you're running with

2010
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:12,699
rock wool cubes you may need to let them

2011
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:15,070
dry a little more if you're running soil

2012
01:54:12,699 --> 01:54:17,199
you may be getting the soil too wet how

2013
01:54:15,069 --> 01:54:19,539
much water is in the grow facility

2014
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:21,399
itself do you have water available to

2015
01:54:19,539 --> 01:54:23,170
evaporate to make condensation in there

2016
01:54:21,399 --> 01:54:25,659
that's gonna help you get powdery mildew

2017
01:54:23,170 --> 01:54:27,010
too much moisture too much water you

2018
01:54:25,659 --> 01:54:28,899
said you're in the desert so too much

2019
01:54:27,010 --> 01:54:30,550
moisture too much water the outside is

2020
01:54:28,899 --> 01:54:32,229
hot the insides real moisture treating a

2021
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:33,789
bubble filled with humidity in there and

2022
01:54:32,229 --> 01:54:35,829
that's going to contribute to your

2023
01:54:33,789 --> 01:54:37,750
powdery mildew so you need heavy

2024
01:54:35,829 --> 01:54:40,149
dehumidification in that room you need

2025
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:41,800
to get that old hot stale air out you

2026
01:54:40,149 --> 01:54:44,139
need to get some fresh air in you need

2027
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:45,850
some ventilation hopefully you're

2028
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:47,530
treating the air that's coming in that's

2029
01:54:45,850 --> 01:54:49,539
something we should talk about you need

2030
01:54:47,529 --> 01:54:52,059
to get that old stale air out stale air

2031
01:54:49,539 --> 01:54:54,430
out of course but there's fresh air

2032
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:56,410
coming in that fresh air coming in does

2033
01:54:54,430 --> 01:55:00,159
need to be treated you need a filter and

2034
01:54:56,409 --> 01:55:01,988
also they make a UV light that is very

2035
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:04,569
good at killing powdery mildew it will

2036
01:55:01,988 --> 01:55:07,179
kill any spores that come in they make a

2037
01:55:04,569 --> 01:55:07,799
light it goes over your ducting so the

2038
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:09,420
duct

2039
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:11,070
the intake ducting comes in and then

2040
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:12,630
this light shines through the ducting

2041
01:55:11,069 --> 01:55:15,599
and everything that passes through that

2042
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:17,850
duct is basically killed so I would use

2043
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:21,900
HEPA filters on all of the intakes and I

2044
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:23,880
would use the UV lighting on all of the

2045
01:55:21,899 --> 01:55:25,500
venting and ducting if you can if you

2046
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:27,180
can pass all the air through one thing

2047
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:29,550
and run a UV light over it that would be

2048
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:30,960
ideal they sell things called clean

2049
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:32,789
lights they're UV lights that are

2050
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,470
designed for gardens they're mostly used

2051
01:55:32,789 --> 01:55:36,659
in like the strawberry industry because

2052
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:38,970
strawberries get a lot of powdery mildew

2053
01:55:36,659 --> 01:55:40,170
on them they sell handheld versions of

2054
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:42,210
these lights that you can actually walk

2055
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:44,039
around the crop and shine this light

2056
01:55:42,210 --> 01:55:46,350
over the entire crop and you just run it

2057
01:55:44,039 --> 01:55:48,989
over I just basically want to illuminate

2058
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:50,730
every inch of the canopy for about a

2059
01:55:48,989 --> 01:55:52,109
half a second to two seconds so you just

2060
01:55:50,729 --> 01:55:53,309
wave your hand waving my hand over it

2061
01:55:52,109 --> 01:55:55,139
right now like you guys can see what I'm

2062
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:56,220
doing but it's basically the same motion

2063
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:58,020
you make when you're watering you know

2064
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:59,850
you just move your hand around back and

2065
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:01,260
forth like a windshield wiper you do

2066
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:02,940
that with this light and you walk over

2067
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:04,920
the canopy and just make sure that the

2068
01:56:02,939 --> 01:56:07,439
light shines on every leaf and that

2069
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:09,119
light kills the powdery mildew it takes

2070
01:56:07,439 --> 01:56:10,500
several applications of that light to

2071
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:12,180
get rid of powdery mildew if you already

2072
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:14,909
have it but if you're persistent with it

2073
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:17,490
that will help so the room needs to be

2074
01:56:14,909 --> 01:56:19,319
corrected there may be some water issues

2075
01:56:17,489 --> 01:56:21,210
you may need some equipment some

2076
01:56:19,319 --> 01:56:23,639
dehumidification you need some air

2077
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:25,560
exchange temperature control is huge you

2078
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:27,329
can't have huge swings huge temperature

2079
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:30,180
swings in the night and in the day are

2080
01:56:27,329 --> 01:56:32,130
going to cause powdery mildew issues so

2081
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:34,680
that's what I think about the room let's

2082
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:36,600
talk about the plants how far apart are

2083
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:38,100
your plants are they touching if the

2084
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:40,560
plant leaves are laying on top of each

2085
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:42,329
other in that little space imagine if

2086
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:45,060
before a sitting in a room and I just

2087
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:46,289
put my hand on this sounds disgusting to

2088
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:49,170
me but what if I just put my head on

2089
01:56:46,289 --> 01:56:51,090
your leg in my hot hand I'm 96 degrees

2090
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:53,069
or whatever I am my head is just sitting

2091
01:56:51,090 --> 01:56:54,270
on your leg in about twenty or thirty

2092
01:56:53,069 --> 01:56:56,340
minutes there's gonna be a hot sweaty

2093
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:57,810
spot there just from our body parts

2094
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:59,340
touching and getting warm there's gonna

2095
01:56:57,810 --> 01:57:01,350
be a little bit of sweat in there that's

2096
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:02,940
sweat that those plants create will

2097
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:04,350
cause powdery mildew right there between

2098
01:57:02,939 --> 01:57:07,169
those two leaves and it'll start

2099
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:09,180
spreading from there rapidly so

2100
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:11,579
something you can really help deep

2101
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:15,210
foliate heavily when I'm in a large

2102
01:57:11,579 --> 01:57:16,680
commercial facility we spend days just

2103
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:18,689
defoliating sometimes it'll be

2104
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:19,920
defoliation day you guys get super

2105
01:57:18,689 --> 01:57:21,268
stoned on your break because when you

2106
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,828
come back all you're doing is pull

2107
01:57:21,269 --> 01:57:24,659
and leaves for the next eight hours just

2108
01:57:22,828 --> 01:57:26,998
pluck every leaf with the PDL out of

2109
01:57:24,658 --> 01:57:28,288
that room if you're I'm not sure if

2110
01:57:26,998 --> 01:57:29,849
you're the manager if you're the boss or

2111
01:57:28,288 --> 01:57:32,668
if you're the owner but if you were able

2112
01:57:29,849 --> 01:57:34,048
to pull every leaf that you can out of

2113
01:57:32,668 --> 01:57:37,048
there those leaves are where the powdery

2114
01:57:34,048 --> 01:57:38,248
mildew happens get it out of there so

2115
01:57:37,048 --> 01:57:40,708
that's what you can do for the plant

2116
01:57:38,248 --> 01:57:42,958
spread them out kind of take off all the

2117
01:57:40,708 --> 01:57:44,398
big leaves put some air on them fan them

2118
01:57:42,958 --> 01:57:46,078
around if the powdery mildew can't

2119
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:47,669
develop because it's blown around too

2120
01:57:46,078 --> 01:57:49,889
much it can't develop if the humidity

2121
01:57:47,668 --> 01:57:52,378
doesn't stay stagnant the powdery mildew

2122
01:57:49,889 --> 01:57:53,939
will have a harder time developing so

2123
01:57:52,378 --> 01:57:57,059
let's talk about you said you sprayed

2124
01:57:53,939 --> 01:57:58,949
everything I pet your plants look pissed

2125
01:57:57,059 --> 01:58:00,208
off they got powdery mildew and you're

2126
01:57:58,948 --> 01:58:01,618
spraying them with stuff and they're

2127
01:58:00,208 --> 01:58:02,668
trying to fight the powdery mildew and

2128
01:58:01,618 --> 01:58:03,958
then they're getting [ __ ] sprayed on

2129
01:58:02,668 --> 01:58:05,849
them frequently but they're getting mad

2130
01:58:03,958 --> 01:58:08,219
I bet you're getting frustrated as hell

2131
01:58:05,849 --> 01:58:10,679
stay positive bro we're going to beat

2132
01:58:08,219 --> 01:58:12,418
this [ __ ] I'm curious what you've

2133
01:58:10,679 --> 01:58:14,668
sprayed because sometimes your sprays

2134
01:58:12,418 --> 01:58:16,559
are going to add more moisture it's

2135
01:58:14,668 --> 01:58:17,998
gonna add more humidity I've sprayed

2136
01:58:16,559 --> 01:58:19,498
commercial rooms thinking yeah I just

2137
01:58:17,998 --> 01:58:20,818
got rid of powdery mildew and I came

2138
01:58:19,498 --> 01:58:22,708
back the next day and the powdery mildew

2139
01:58:20,819 --> 01:58:23,129
is actually thicker drove me [ __ ]

2140
01:58:22,708 --> 01:58:24,568
nuts

2141
01:58:23,128 --> 01:58:26,158
so like I'm saying you got to fix the

2142
01:58:24,569 --> 01:58:27,929
room you have to spread the plants apart

2143
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:30,058
if you've got a bunch of water on the

2144
01:58:27,929 --> 01:58:31,708
floor squeegee and shop-vac that [ __ ] up

2145
01:58:30,059 --> 01:58:33,689
get rid of that extra water so let's

2146
01:58:31,708 --> 01:58:36,809
talk about sprays what have you sprayed

2147
01:58:33,689 --> 01:58:39,719
I'm really curious um there is a product

2148
01:58:36,809 --> 01:58:41,909
called big-time exterminator that I have

2149
01:58:39,719 --> 01:58:44,849
heard works wonders on powdery mildew

2150
01:58:41,908 --> 01:58:46,259
it's organic and it is okay here's

2151
01:58:44,849 --> 01:58:48,239
something I should mention in Colorado

2152
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:50,338
we are very limited on products that we

2153
01:58:48,238 --> 01:58:52,048
can use a lot of people will say go get

2154
01:58:50,338 --> 01:58:54,389
a bottle of Eagle 20 and spray that [ __ ]

2155
01:58:52,048 --> 01:58:56,488
right on your plants Eagle 20 will get

2156
01:58:54,389 --> 01:58:58,048
rid of your powdery mildew it may take

2157
01:58:56,488 --> 01:58:59,638
one application it may take two

2158
01:58:58,048 --> 01:59:02,788
applications but your powdery mildew

2159
01:58:59,639 --> 01:59:05,519
will be gone for 30 days maybe 45 to 60

2160
01:59:02,788 --> 01:59:07,648
days guaranteed I personally do not like

2161
01:59:05,519 --> 01:59:10,229
Eagle 20 there are a lot of deadly

2162
01:59:07,649 --> 01:59:12,899
dangerous shitty chemicals in there that

2163
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:14,489
we do not need to spray on our plants

2164
01:59:12,899 --> 01:59:16,588
that we are going to call medicine to

2165
01:59:14,488 --> 01:59:19,618
give to sick people I do not recommend

2166
01:59:16,588 --> 01:59:21,599
eagle 20 in Colorado Eagle 20 is

2167
01:59:19,618 --> 01:59:23,518
completely banned we are not allowed to

2168
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:24,958
use it in a recreational or a medical

2169
01:59:23,519 --> 01:59:26,579
facility that is regulated by the

2170
01:59:24,958 --> 01:59:29,698
Colorado marijuana Enforcement Division

2171
01:59:26,578 --> 01:59:31,588
is a banned product I like that some

2172
01:59:29,698 --> 01:59:32,848
products are banned it keeps us safe it

2173
01:59:31,588 --> 01:59:35,069
keeps our growers safe

2174
01:59:32,849 --> 01:59:36,750
it keeps the consumer safe

2175
01:59:35,069 --> 01:59:38,279
we haven't done enough research on a lot

2176
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:40,859
of these chemicals to know what's going

2177
01:59:38,279 --> 01:59:42,449
to happen to us if we smoke it and a lot

2178
01:59:40,859 --> 01:59:45,238
of these things affect your body in a

2179
01:59:42,449 --> 01:59:47,369
way that say I spray my plants with evil

2180
01:59:45,238 --> 01:59:48,659
20 today and we let them flower we

2181
01:59:47,369 --> 01:59:51,300
harvest them we cut them down that's

2182
01:59:48,659 --> 01:59:53,550
probably you know 50 to 60 days they let

2183
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:56,070
them dry you smoke it there's probably

2184
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:57,630
still evil 20 on those buds when I smoke

2185
01:59:56,069 --> 01:59:59,009
it I don't think I'm gonna notice

2186
01:59:57,630 --> 02:00:00,900
anything right away I may get a funky

2187
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:02,820
taste my throat may burn but that's it

2188
02:00:00,899 --> 02:00:04,409
but I'm thinking that in like 10 years

2189
02:00:02,819 --> 02:00:06,329
is what I'm gonna notice the [ __ ] up

2190
02:00:04,409 --> 02:00:08,279
from that I'm gonna get a twitch my left

2191
02:00:06,329 --> 02:00:10,319
eye is gonna pop out I'm gonna talk

2192
02:00:08,279 --> 02:00:12,119
funny I might get a limp or even a

2193
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:15,840
bigger fear maybe it does something to

2194
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:17,130
my DNA or my RNA and my I'm not I don't

2195
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:19,170
plan on having any more kids but maybe

2196
02:00:17,130 --> 02:00:20,489
you do maybe it'll [ __ ] up your RNA and

2197
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:22,800
your DNA and your kids will come out

2198
02:00:20,488 --> 02:00:25,979
with three arms or three eyes or one

2199
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:27,420
foot or 14 toes you know so we don't

2200
02:00:25,979 --> 02:00:29,069
know enough about what these these

2201
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:30,890
chemicals kill mildews and they kill

2202
02:00:29,069 --> 02:00:33,029
bugs so it's doing something

2203
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:34,050
biologically or something it depends on

2204
02:00:33,029 --> 02:00:35,099
what kind of chemical you're using but

2205
02:00:34,050 --> 02:00:36,539
it's doing something and it could be

2206
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:38,280
getting into your body and [ __ ] up

2207
02:00:36,539 --> 02:00:40,439
your body by smoking it so we need to be

2208
02:00:38,279 --> 02:00:41,939
really careful I know I got way off

2209
02:00:40,439 --> 02:00:44,399
topic just kind of want to rant there

2210
02:00:41,939 --> 02:00:45,689
but if you want a spray eagle 20 go in

2211
02:00:44,399 --> 02:00:47,219
there hit that shoot with eagle 20

2212
02:00:45,689 --> 02:00:48,689
problem solved you got a little bit of

2213
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:50,070
time to figure out how to fix the rooms

2214
02:00:48,689 --> 02:00:51,599
and then hopefully you can fix it again

2215
02:00:50,069 --> 02:00:53,549
and not ever have to use the Eagle 20

2216
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:56,250
again I don't recommend that [ __ ] you

2217
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:58,440
guys at all at all at all things that we

2218
02:00:56,250 --> 02:01:00,420
are allowed to use in Colorado a product

2219
02:00:58,439 --> 02:01:03,149
called big-time exterminator it's mostly

2220
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:04,500
citrus oil or citrus it's citrus

2221
02:01:03,149 --> 02:01:06,960
something I think a citrus oil mostly

2222
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:09,029
citrus oil extract it sounds like smells

2223
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,859
like oranges it's kind of nice like

2224
02:01:09,029 --> 02:01:13,829
lemony smell orange II smell citrusy

2225
02:01:10,859 --> 02:01:17,009
smell to it I mixed that up I think I

2226
02:01:13,829 --> 02:01:18,899
put I did whatever the bucket says

2227
02:01:17,010 --> 02:01:20,489
there's an ingredients on the bucket go

2228
02:01:18,899 --> 02:01:22,799
the heavy route mix it up with some

2229
02:01:20,488 --> 02:01:25,769
water spray that right on the plants and

2230
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:27,420
that stuff should calm down the powdery

2231
02:01:25,770 --> 02:01:29,130
mildew you may have to go for a few

2232
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:31,409
applications of that that'll take care

2233
02:01:29,130 --> 02:01:34,199
of your powdery mildew another product

2234
02:01:31,409 --> 02:01:39,119
that I have seen work on powdery mildew

2235
02:01:34,199 --> 02:01:42,300
is 30 percent hydrogen peroxide I saw a

2236
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:44,309
guy put 50 milliliters of hydrogen

2237
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:46,860
peroxide in a five-gallon bucket and

2238
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:48,900
sprayed that directly he adjusted the pH

2239
02:01:46,859 --> 02:01:51,000
and then sprayed that direct

2240
02:01:48,899 --> 02:01:52,619
on to the entire crop and you could

2241
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:55,859
kinda see the hydrogen peroxide

2242
02:01:52,619 --> 02:01:57,479
breakdown the powdery mildew she sprayed

2243
02:01:55,859 --> 02:01:59,639
the entire crop and then he went ahead

2244
02:01:57,479 --> 02:02:01,678
and sprayed the entire room sprayed

2245
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:03,510
everything down everything smelled like

2246
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:05,670
hydrogen peroxide it smelled super clean

2247
02:02:03,510 --> 02:02:07,949
in there it took several applications I

2248
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:10,050
think he was going at it daily but by

2249
02:02:07,948 --> 02:02:12,299
the end of a week the powdery mildew was

2250
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:14,789
gone so you can use PM wash you can use

2251
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:16,199
hydrogen peroxide you can use oh sorry I

2252
02:02:14,789 --> 02:02:18,539
didn't say p.m. wash there's a product

2253
02:02:16,198 --> 02:02:19,948
called PM wash which I haven't used it

2254
02:02:18,539 --> 02:02:22,619
but I've read great things about it the

2255
02:02:19,948 --> 02:02:25,948
PM wash should wash the powdery mildew

2256
02:02:22,619 --> 02:02:27,869
off of your plants so peroxide PM wash

2257
02:02:25,948 --> 02:02:29,639
and Big Time exterminator are three

2258
02:02:27,869 --> 02:02:31,260
products that you can buy you can order

2259
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:33,690
them over the Internet you can probably

2260
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:36,810
buy them at your local grocers those

2261
02:02:33,689 --> 02:02:38,759
products I'm told will get rid of your

2262
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:40,380
powdery mildew I have seen the hydrogen

2263
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:42,030
peroxide do it I've seen the big-time

2264
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:43,500
exterminator do it it'll take multiple

2265
02:02:42,029 --> 02:02:45,509
applications you have to be persistent

2266
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:46,738
you have to pay attention to the plants

2267
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:48,719
they're gonna need a little bit of love

2268
02:02:46,738 --> 02:02:50,428
after this if you're gonna spray them

2269
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:52,050
for several days with the products like

2270
02:02:50,429 --> 02:02:52,679
big-time exterminator or hydrogen

2271
02:02:52,050 --> 02:02:54,510
peroxide

2272
02:02:52,679 --> 02:02:56,310
I recommend give them a day of rest and

2273
02:02:54,510 --> 02:02:58,619
then spray them with push from our

2274
02:02:56,310 --> 02:03:00,390
friends at veg bloom they do not pay me

2275
02:02:58,619 --> 02:03:02,519
to talk about their products but push is

2276
02:03:00,390 --> 02:03:03,780
an amazing product it's a foliar product

2277
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:06,060
it's a little hard to get it's a little

2278
02:03:03,779 --> 02:03:07,619
bit expensive but oh my god it's worth

2279
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:09,390
every penny and if you're gonna do this

2280
02:03:07,619 --> 02:03:11,010
much damage and this much beating up to

2281
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:13,050
your plants I think push would be really

2282
02:03:11,010 --> 02:03:15,960
helpful another product I can recommend

2283
02:03:13,050 --> 02:03:17,730
is a product called stylet oils silent

2284
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:19,920
oil is not allowed to be used in a

2285
02:03:17,729 --> 02:03:22,049
recreational or commercial facility in

2286
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:24,090
Colorado but I have used it myself and

2287
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:27,029
it did take care of everything

2288
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:29,369
a stylet oil is an oil that coats your

2289
02:03:27,029 --> 02:03:31,559
plant and it will not allow the powdery

2290
02:03:29,369 --> 02:03:33,479
mildew to grow on the plant it will not

2291
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:34,980
allow fungus gnats to gather on the

2292
02:03:33,479 --> 02:03:36,599
plant it won't let mites get on the

2293
02:03:34,979 --> 02:03:38,579
bottom side of the plant nothing wants

2294
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:40,710
anything to do with styling oil the

2295
02:03:38,579 --> 02:03:42,600
problem with styling oil is it strips

2296
02:03:40,710 --> 02:03:43,948
the cuticles off your plant leaves and

2297
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:45,989
it leaves them really vulnerable and

2298
02:03:43,948 --> 02:03:47,939
they look a little leathery they get

2299
02:03:45,988 --> 02:03:50,908
kind of sad at you about it if you're

2300
02:03:47,939 --> 02:03:53,579
going to use styling oil I would if your

2301
02:03:50,908 --> 02:03:55,829
plants are small enough I would dunk the

2302
02:03:53,579 --> 02:03:57,300
plants into a stylet oil diluted heavily

2303
02:03:55,829 --> 02:03:59,158
don't go straight into the oil sorry let

2304
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:00,300
me say that mix up some styling oil I

2305
02:03:59,158 --> 02:04:01,789
cannot think of the dilution

2306
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:04,310
recommendations but it is

2307
02:04:01,789 --> 02:04:07,039
on the bottle go light dunk the plant

2308
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:08,720
into the stylet oil get every leaf in

2309
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:11,329
there give it a good wiggle pull it out

2310
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:13,250
set it back in the grow area turn off

2311
02:04:11,329 --> 02:04:15,019
the lights let it dry give it about an

2312
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:16,489
hour let all the plants dry after you've

2313
02:04:15,020 --> 02:04:18,590
dunked everything and then go back with

2314
02:04:16,489 --> 02:04:21,079
the sprayer and hose off every single

2315
02:04:18,590 --> 02:04:22,190
plant the stylet oil will dry and coat

2316
02:04:21,079 --> 02:04:24,829
and then you just want to kind of rinse

2317
02:04:22,189 --> 02:04:27,409
off the excess and all of your powdery

2318
02:04:24,829 --> 02:04:29,510
mildew and bugs should be removed within

2319
02:04:27,409 --> 02:04:30,769
the first application styling oil will

2320
02:04:29,510 --> 02:04:32,420
[ __ ] your plants up if they're not

2321
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:34,190
strong it's gonna beat the [ __ ] out of

2322
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:36,260
them maybe test a couple of plants

2323
02:04:34,189 --> 02:04:39,439
because it does beat your plants up

2324
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:41,060
heavily but it will work I had almost

2325
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:42,679
forgotten about the stylet oil where are

2326
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:45,110
you located man I've got a huge bottle

2327
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:47,360
of JMS silent oil that I do not think

2328
02:04:45,109 --> 02:04:49,429
I'm going to use if you're near me we

2329
02:04:47,359 --> 02:04:50,359
can work out a deal just [ __ ] I want

2330
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:52,820
to see what happens when you use it

2331
02:04:50,359 --> 02:04:55,279
let's see where am I now another thing

2332
02:04:52,819 --> 02:04:56,779
that we can talk about our friend frosty

2333
02:04:55,279 --> 02:04:58,939
organics was on the podcast quite a

2334
02:04:56,779 --> 02:05:02,029
while back and he talked about lactic

2335
02:04:58,939 --> 02:05:03,679
acid bacteria spray frosty taught us

2336
02:05:02,029 --> 02:05:05,210
that he can make his own lactic acid

2337
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:07,070
bacteria spray and apply it to the

2338
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:10,069
plants and he says that one application

2339
02:05:07,069 --> 02:05:11,420
will remove his powdery mildew issue I'm

2340
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:13,759
not sure how well that works I have not

2341
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:15,920
tried it myself but I do trust the [ __ ]

2342
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:18,560
out of frosty organics so if you want to

2343
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:20,060
learn about lactic acid bacteria and how

2344
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:23,000
to treat your cannabis plants with it

2345
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:25,370
you can google lactic acid bacteria and

2346
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,560
then powdery mildew and then there will

2347
02:05:25,369 --> 02:05:29,390
be the word Clackamas in there Clackamas

2348
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:31,820
is a city in Oregon there's a guy named

2349
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:34,220
Clackamas coot who is from that part of

2350
02:05:31,819 --> 02:05:36,019
Oregon who wrote an article about making

2351
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:37,369
lactic acid bacteria to treat for

2352
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:41,270
powdery mildew if you google it it

2353
02:05:37,369 --> 02:05:42,769
should not be too hard to find

2354
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:44,990
as something else I want to mention in

2355
02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:46,910
professional horticultural applications

2356
02:05:44,989 --> 02:05:48,889
and environments what is commonly used

2357
02:05:46,909 --> 02:05:50,989
for powdery mildew is a product called

2358
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:52,550
potassium bicarbonate it's available in

2359
02:05:50,989 --> 02:05:54,829
several different forms from what I read

2360
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:56,960
they say that it makes this up very much

2361
02:05:54,829 --> 02:05:58,519
like a baking soda in water and you

2362
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:01,579
apply that to your plants as a foliar

2363
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:03,140
spray and that disrupts the pH on the

2364
02:06:01,579 --> 02:06:04,819
surface of the leaf which will get rid

2365
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:06,650
of your powdery mildew and it is a

2366
02:06:04,819 --> 02:06:08,659
horticultural standard it's what they

2367
02:06:06,649 --> 02:06:11,359
use in large greenhouses for large

2368
02:06:08,659 --> 02:06:13,189
production so potassium bicarbonate from

2369
02:06:11,359 --> 02:06:15,319
what I read it's like it comes in a very

2370
02:06:13,189 --> 02:06:17,299
powdery form that's like baking soda

2371
02:06:15,319 --> 02:06:18,859
they say it's available in other forms I

2372
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:20,600
check that out maybe that's something

2373
02:06:18,859 --> 02:06:21,829
that'll help you out if you're in a

2374
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:23,690
commercial girl I'm not sure if that

2375
02:06:21,829 --> 02:06:25,670
will be legal so make sure you check out

2376
02:06:23,689 --> 02:06:28,129
all of the laws I don't know where you

2377
02:06:25,670 --> 02:06:29,989
are I don't know the rules so everything

2378
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:32,750
I say needs to be researched before you

2379
02:06:29,989 --> 02:06:34,489
apply it another thing that people are

2380
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:36,109
gonna recommend for you for your powdery

2381
02:06:34,489 --> 02:06:38,960
mildew issue people are going to say to

2382
02:06:36,109 --> 02:06:40,729
hang a sulfur burner in the grow and run

2383
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,649
the sulfur burner for an hour or 45

2384
02:06:40,729 --> 02:06:43,729
minutes every few hours or something

2385
02:06:42,649 --> 02:06:46,909
like that everyone's gonna have their

2386
02:06:43,729 --> 02:06:48,859
own recipe I highly advise against this

2387
02:06:46,909 --> 02:06:51,079
you guys I do not like a sulfur burner

2388
02:06:48,859 --> 02:06:53,210
there was a dispensary in Colorado I

2389
02:06:51,079 --> 02:06:55,579
will not call them out they were in

2390
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:57,199
Denver they were a very very well known

2391
02:06:55,579 --> 02:06:58,609
dispensary they had a very well-known

2392
02:06:57,199 --> 02:07:01,429
breeder working with them who actually

2393
02:06:58,609 --> 02:07:03,500
left and started his own thing that

2394
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:05,329
facility was having a powdery mildew

2395
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:09,229
issue and their solution was to run a

2396
02:07:05,329 --> 02:07:11,029
sulfur burner the results were for about

2397
02:07:09,229 --> 02:07:13,129
six months every time you would shop at

2398
02:07:11,029 --> 02:07:16,279
that dispensary everything would have at

2399
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:17,569
first it was a flavor of sulfur it would

2400
02:07:16,279 --> 02:07:19,699
smoke it need like why does this taste

2401
02:07:17,569 --> 02:07:20,750
weird and it was sulfur II once somebody

2402
02:07:19,699 --> 02:07:21,979
would say I think there's a sulphur

2403
02:07:20,750 --> 02:07:23,899
burner your brain would go oh yeah it

2404
02:07:21,979 --> 02:07:25,219
totally tastes like sulfur so it was

2405
02:07:23,899 --> 02:07:26,750
really strong at first and over a few

2406
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:28,430
months it faded out but you could taste

2407
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:29,960
it for a long time they've gotten rid of

2408
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:31,970
the sulfur burner they've corrected

2409
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:33,680
their problem now it doesn't happen but

2410
02:07:31,970 --> 02:07:35,780
that's why you don't run a sulfur burner

2411
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:38,810
in there it will make your plants taste

2412
02:07:35,779 --> 02:07:40,369
like [ __ ] so don't do this whole 4

2413
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:43,130
burner that's not something I would

2414
02:07:40,369 --> 02:07:44,529
recommend something that you can do that

2415
02:07:43,130 --> 02:07:46,480
may help you

2416
02:07:44,529 --> 02:07:48,158
I'm not sure if you're using mother

2417
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:49,808
plants or if you're taking plants taking

2418
02:07:48,158 --> 02:07:51,460
cuts from your vegging plants or how

2419
02:07:49,809 --> 02:07:52,000
that works but when you were taking

2420
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:55,658
clones

2421
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,069
I recommend dunking them I cut my clone

2422
02:07:55,658 --> 02:07:59,500
from the mother plant I put them in a

2423
02:07:57,069 --> 02:08:01,299
cup with water and a small bit of

2424
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:03,250
nutrients and then I carried that cup

2425
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:05,199
filled with cuttings to another area

2426
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:07,300
where they are trimmed up then they are

2427
02:08:05,198 --> 02:08:09,339
dunked into a solution and then they are

2428
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:11,739
dipped and then stuck into either the

2429
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:13,599
cloner if I'm working at one facility or

2430
02:08:11,738 --> 02:08:15,279
they're put into plugs if I'm at another

2431
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:16,569
facility or they're put in a rock wall

2432
02:08:15,279 --> 02:08:17,618
at another facility just depends on

2433
02:08:16,569 --> 02:08:19,689
where I'm working and who am working

2434
02:08:17,618 --> 02:08:22,089
away from what I got going on but after

2435
02:08:19,689 --> 02:08:23,618
the cut I like to dunk the freshly cut

2436
02:08:22,090 --> 02:08:25,510
clone and trimmed up you cut off the

2437
02:08:23,618 --> 02:08:27,639
leaves you trim off all the extra then I

2438
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:30,900
dunk that right into something I will

2439
02:08:27,639 --> 02:08:34,750
change my eye product up sometimes I use

2440
02:08:30,899 --> 02:08:35,859
vanish sometimes I will use the what's

2441
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:37,719
it called the big-time exterminator

2442
02:08:35,859 --> 02:08:39,609
because I wrote down BTE and I can

2443
02:08:37,719 --> 02:08:41,439
always forget that stands for a big-time

2444
02:08:39,609 --> 02:08:43,509
exterminator sometimes I'll mix up the

2445
02:08:41,439 --> 02:08:45,009
hydrogen peroxide just depends on what's

2446
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:47,679
available and what I'm treating for what

2447
02:08:45,010 --> 02:08:49,179
I think may I may be at risk for but we

2448
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:51,250
know that powdery mildew is the problem

2449
02:08:49,179 --> 02:08:53,288
here so mix up a little bit of hydrogen

2450
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:54,908
peroxide in your water I just use a

2451
02:08:53,288 --> 02:08:56,920
five-gallon bucket I mean anywhere

2452
02:08:54,908 --> 02:08:59,259
between 30 and 70 mils of hydrogen

2453
02:08:56,920 --> 02:09:01,538
peroxide usually seems to work for me

2454
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:02,829
cut the clone dunk that right into the

2455
02:09:01,538 --> 02:09:05,198
five-gallon bucket a hydrogen peroxide

2456
02:09:02,828 --> 02:09:07,840
give it a nice hefty shake and then put

2457
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:09,399
that into the dip and grow or the clone

2458
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,849
X or whatever you were using wherever

2459
02:09:09,399 --> 02:09:12,549
the hell we are

2460
02:09:09,849 --> 02:09:14,409
and then stick that right into the the

2461
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:15,909
cloner whatever I'm going into and then

2462
02:09:14,408 --> 02:09:17,920
I know that I killed all of the powdery

2463
02:09:15,908 --> 02:09:19,388
mildew so that I've got a fresh start so

2464
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:21,340
that that clone can root and have a

2465
02:09:19,389 --> 02:09:23,170
healthy start then as soon as it roots

2466
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:25,349
and it gets put into its first pot I'll

2467
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:27,969
spray it with something and then every

2468
02:09:25,349 --> 02:09:29,980
I'll spray it once a week with something

2469
02:09:27,969 --> 02:09:32,710
and then if I see powdery mildew or

2470
02:09:29,979 --> 02:09:34,868
here's here's a hint a little bit before

2471
02:09:32,710 --> 02:09:37,288
powdery mildew starts you will see

2472
02:09:34,868 --> 02:09:40,058
little tiny bumps pop up the leaf may

2473
02:09:37,288 --> 02:09:41,408
start to just get a little bit bumpy I

2474
02:09:40,059 --> 02:09:42,940
don't even know how to it just looks

2475
02:09:41,408 --> 02:09:44,439
like a little pimple or a war or

2476
02:09:42,939 --> 02:09:46,328
something funky coming up on the leaf

2477
02:09:44,439 --> 02:09:47,710
but it's real small so if you start

2478
02:09:46,328 --> 02:09:49,750
seeing that then it's time to start

2479
02:09:47,710 --> 02:09:52,179
treating for powdery mildew extra-strong

2480
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:54,010
get out your UV clean light get out your

2481
02:09:52,179 --> 02:09:55,599
hydrogen peroxide get out the PM wash

2482
02:09:54,010 --> 02:09:56,850
the big-time exterminator the lactic

2483
02:09:55,599 --> 02:09:59,579
acid bacteria the

2484
02:09:56,850 --> 02:10:01,440
seem bicarbonate something like that get

2485
02:09:59,579 --> 02:10:02,519
it out there start treating those plants

2486
02:10:01,439 --> 02:10:04,559
because you're gonna see the powdery

2487
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:06,330
mildew but if I see that that's when I

2488
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:08,220
start stepping up my game going a little

2489
02:10:06,329 --> 02:10:10,350
bit harder one more thing I should

2490
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:12,240
mention is the powdery mildew could be

2491
02:10:10,350 --> 02:10:13,710
on your clothes you're carrying it

2492
02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:15,389
around from the flower room to the

2493
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:17,609
bedroom to the mother room to the clone

2494
02:10:15,390 --> 02:10:19,230
room it's in your air-conditioning ducts

2495
02:10:17,609 --> 02:10:21,479
it's in your HVAC system it is

2496
02:10:19,229 --> 02:10:23,699
everywhere it needs to be taken care of

2497
02:10:21,479 --> 02:10:25,229
it needs to be treated if you've got

2498
02:10:23,699 --> 02:10:27,720
those silly ducts that have the

2499
02:10:25,229 --> 02:10:29,279
insulation inside of them tear that [ __ ]

2500
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:30,840
out of there I know that could be a

2501
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:32,729
multi-thousand dollar job for your

2502
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:35,100
facility but all of that insulation

2503
02:10:32,729 --> 02:10:36,509
inside of there is harboring harboring

2504
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:38,730
that was a hard word to say the

2505
02:10:36,510 --> 02:10:41,070
insulation is harboring powdery mildew

2506
02:10:38,729 --> 02:10:43,019
and it will eventually be a place for

2507
02:10:41,069 --> 02:10:45,960
bugs to hide out once one gets in there

2508
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:47,490
just takes two and those bugs will start

2509
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:48,840
a party it'll be disgusting so you could

2510
02:10:47,489 --> 02:10:49,889
have the powdery mildew under close make

2511
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:52,140
sure everybody's changing clothes

2512
02:10:49,890 --> 02:10:53,970
properly I bet you've got a grower that

2513
02:10:52,140 --> 02:10:56,280
has a private grow at home and he's got

2514
02:10:53,970 --> 02:10:57,930
powdery mildew also and as soon as he

2515
02:10:56,279 --> 02:10:59,849
starts getting rid of powdery mildew you

2516
02:10:57,930 --> 02:11:01,560
get it worse and then as soon as your

2517
02:10:59,850 --> 02:11:02,700
facility starts getting it cleaned up he

2518
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:04,200
gets it worse and you guys are just

2519
02:11:02,699 --> 02:11:05,989
passing that [ __ ] back and forth and

2520
02:11:04,199 --> 02:11:08,609
it's never gonna go away

2521
02:11:05,989 --> 02:11:10,380
so start changing your clothes get some

2522
02:11:08,609 --> 02:11:12,869
dedicated clothes dedicated shoes a

2523
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:15,060
dedicated hat if you've got long hair or

2524
02:11:12,869 --> 02:11:16,500
dreadlocks get it wrapped up get it in a

2525
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:18,420
hat get it covered up you guys I'm

2526
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:19,859
always going and REE tucking my dreads

2527
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:22,140
cuz I try to keep everything covered up

2528
02:11:19,859 --> 02:11:23,819
I don't want dragging my dreads long

2529
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:25,710
around the grow think it's gross I need

2530
02:11:23,819 --> 02:11:27,359
to be picking up bugs or leaving a hair

2531
02:11:25,710 --> 02:11:28,710
in the flowers just just keep your

2532
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:30,539
dreads in your hair cover it up if

2533
02:11:28,710 --> 02:11:31,829
you've got a big man book beard or if

2534
02:11:30,539 --> 02:11:34,199
you've got a hipster beard cover that

2535
02:11:31,829 --> 02:11:36,359
[ __ ] up too I just try to be clean you

2536
02:11:34,199 --> 02:11:38,939
guys another thing I really want to

2537
02:11:36,359 --> 02:11:40,649
recommend I did work in a facility that

2538
02:11:38,939 --> 02:11:42,210
was riddled with powdery mildew I won't

2539
02:11:40,649 --> 02:11:43,409
call them out on a podcast most of my

2540
02:11:42,210 --> 02:11:45,359
friends and listeners know who the [ __ ]

2541
02:11:43,409 --> 02:11:47,639
I'm talking about the place was riddled

2542
02:11:45,359 --> 02:11:49,829
with powdery mildew they fired a grower

2543
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:51,539
I took over I walked in and I said we've

2544
02:11:49,829 --> 02:11:52,920
got bugs and powdery mildew to start

2545
02:11:51,539 --> 02:11:54,750
with and they're like yes we do help us

2546
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:57,239
I tried to get rid of it you guys but

2547
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:59,909
being Emmy deregulated I understand the

2548
02:11:57,239 --> 02:12:02,069
struggle that my listener here has it

2549
02:11:59,909 --> 02:12:03,779
was a pain in the ass everybody in that

2550
02:12:02,069 --> 02:12:05,069
grow got sick because of the powdery

2551
02:12:03,779 --> 02:12:06,750
mildew the mildew is gone you guys it

2552
02:12:05,069 --> 02:12:08,069
took two or three crops

2553
02:12:06,750 --> 02:12:08,939
two or three crop cycles to get rid of

2554
02:12:08,069 --> 02:12:10,679
it but the

2555
02:12:08,939 --> 02:12:12,629
Romilda was actually done we got rid of

2556
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:14,310
it in a hundred light facility that PM

2557
02:12:12,630 --> 02:12:16,079
was gone you could not see it you could

2558
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:17,670
not smell it you could not taste it it

2559
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:20,519
was cleaned up so they did their job

2560
02:12:17,670 --> 02:12:22,319
they got rid of it but everybody kind of

2561
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:24,360
got like a scientist sort of thing

2562
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:25,439
everybody showed different symptoms but

2563
02:12:24,359 --> 02:12:27,149
everybody could agree that it was

2564
02:12:25,439 --> 02:12:30,210
messing up their noses their throat and

2565
02:12:27,149 --> 02:12:32,039
their eye region so wear a mask if

2566
02:12:30,210 --> 02:12:33,539
you've got a ventilator or respirator or

2567
02:12:32,039 --> 02:12:36,630
even one of those just shitty little

2568
02:12:33,539 --> 02:12:37,680
paper Asian bird flu masks just wear one

2569
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:39,119
of those when you're working with the

2570
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:41,820
powdery mildew because you don't want to

2571
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:43,710
get sick from it I tried to deny that I

2572
02:12:41,819 --> 02:12:46,019
was sick from the powdery mildew but

2573
02:12:43,710 --> 02:12:48,989
once it was gone I felt better and I

2574
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:50,790
could tell that my allergy problem and

2575
02:12:48,988 --> 02:12:52,169
my throat thing was happening because of

2576
02:12:50,789 --> 02:12:53,698
that powdery mildew that's what was

2577
02:12:52,170 --> 02:12:57,569
doing it so please take care of yourself

2578
02:12:53,698 --> 02:12:59,849
if the plants are bad powdery mildew E

2579
02:12:57,569 --> 02:13:01,619
you have to think about if you want to

2580
02:12:59,850 --> 02:13:04,739
release that product to the public

2581
02:13:01,619 --> 02:13:08,010
because you don't want to be responsible

2582
02:13:04,738 --> 02:13:09,179
for making people sick so that's a moral

2583
02:13:08,010 --> 02:13:12,090
thing you're gonna have to think about

2584
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:15,210
yourself something that they do allow

2585
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:18,210
here in Colorado they will let you blast

2586
02:13:15,210 --> 02:13:21,329
the powdery mildew buds the marijuana

2587
02:13:18,210 --> 02:13:24,899
Enforcement Division has decided that it

2588
02:13:21,329 --> 02:13:27,210
is safe to put powdery mildew buds and

2589
02:13:24,899 --> 02:13:31,799
trim into a tube and run butane over and

2590
02:13:27,210 --> 02:13:34,469
turn it in to Pho a hash dabs

2591
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:36,989
shatter wax it turns into distillate

2592
02:13:34,469 --> 02:13:39,719
eventually it gets put into edibles

2593
02:13:36,988 --> 02:13:40,979
eventually so yeah they're deeming it

2594
02:13:39,719 --> 02:13:43,230
safe so if that's what you want to do

2595
02:13:40,979 --> 02:13:44,669
with it do that that's the best I can

2596
02:13:43,229 --> 02:13:46,889
recommend with it but honestly if it's

2597
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:48,600
coated in powdery mildew think about

2598
02:13:46,890 --> 02:13:50,430
this my friend Doug is getting old and

2599
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:52,650
Doug's got a lung problem and when Doug

2600
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:54,420
smokes regular cannabis he coughs

2601
02:13:52,649 --> 02:13:56,309
but Doug smokes cannabis that's got

2602
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:59,369
something on it he coughs a lot and gets

2603
02:13:56,310 --> 02:14:01,500
really sick Doug is smoking because he's

2604
02:13:59,369 --> 02:14:04,050
sick and trying to prolong and save his

2605
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:06,569
life we do not want to give Doug powdery

2606
02:14:04,050 --> 02:14:09,390
mildews and mycotoxins and funky [ __ ]

2607
02:14:06,569 --> 02:14:11,549
for his lungs to kill him more quickly

2608
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:14,850
I love Doug I [ __ ] want him here

2609
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:16,409
treat everybody like Doug okay everybody

2610
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:18,630
that's getting cannabis is my friend

2611
02:14:16,409 --> 02:14:20,340
Doug in my mind we all have to take care

2612
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:21,050
of all of our patients like they are

2613
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:22,969
Doug

2614
02:14:21,050 --> 02:14:25,130
all right dougie was a real dude but I

2615
02:14:22,969 --> 02:14:26,750
kind of exaggerated his story Doug's not

2616
02:14:25,130 --> 02:14:27,949
that sick you guys just wanted to use

2617
02:14:26,750 --> 02:14:30,559
him as an example because he's a good

2618
02:14:27,948 --> 02:14:31,908
dude all right I hope I've given you

2619
02:14:30,559 --> 02:14:34,460
some information that kind of teaches

2620
02:14:31,908 --> 02:14:35,839
you how to at least control and harness

2621
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:37,279
and get rid of this powdery mildew I'm

2622
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:39,559
not sure what you can do where you are

2623
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:40,969
so you can spray any of these products

2624
02:14:39,559 --> 02:14:43,190
that you choose to spray you can D

2625
02:14:40,969 --> 02:14:45,889
foliate things that I fully recommend

2626
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:48,469
you do are get the old air out the fresh

2627
02:14:45,889 --> 02:14:51,078
air in dehumidifier do some filtration

2628
02:14:48,469 --> 02:14:52,219
also space out the plants a little bit

2629
02:14:51,078 --> 02:14:54,738
make sure they aren't touching each

2630
02:14:52,219 --> 02:14:56,539
other and then control temperature

2631
02:14:54,738 --> 02:14:57,948
swings you're in the desert and you're

2632
02:14:56,539 --> 02:14:59,689
putting a bunch of water inside of a

2633
02:14:57,948 --> 02:15:01,129
building you're making it excuse me

2634
02:14:59,689 --> 02:15:03,439
you're making a big Tupperware dish and

2635
02:15:01,130 --> 02:15:04,489
it's you're making a giant comb dome is

2636
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:07,789
what you're doing in there so you need

2637
02:15:04,488 --> 02:15:09,919
to evacuate the humidity and get that

2638
02:15:07,789 --> 02:15:11,118
out of the room don't be afraid to throw

2639
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:12,559
away some plants if they're starting to

2640
02:15:11,118 --> 02:15:14,058
get too bad I know that sounds terrible

2641
02:15:12,559 --> 02:15:15,710
in a commercial production facility I've

2642
02:15:14,059 --> 02:15:17,869
been there before trust me I have dealt

2643
02:15:15,710 --> 02:15:18,618
with what you're dealing with some days

2644
02:15:17,868 --> 02:15:19,880
it makes you want to punch yourself

2645
02:15:18,618 --> 02:15:22,789
straight in the face but I did an

2646
02:15:19,880 --> 02:15:24,949
episode a few episodes back called stay

2647
02:15:22,789 --> 02:15:26,210
positive and if you didn't have powdery

2648
02:15:24,948 --> 02:15:27,828
mildew it wouldn't be getting so many

2649
02:15:26,210 --> 02:15:29,118
hours should be too easy

2650
02:15:27,828 --> 02:15:31,039
wouldn't be a challenge wouldn't be fun

2651
02:15:29,118 --> 02:15:33,109
anymore so you got to go through some

2652
02:15:31,039 --> 02:15:34,880
struggles and that way when those issues

2653
02:15:33,109 --> 02:15:36,348
are gone it's gonna be like your [ __ ]

2654
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,699
prison and the coolest damn facility

2655
02:15:36,349 --> 02:15:39,050
ever and you'll appreciate it that's

2656
02:15:37,698 --> 02:15:40,399
what I think stay positive don't pull

2657
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:42,199
your hair don't put yourself in the face

2658

02:27:34,799 --> 02:27:38,639
day's feel shorter in Colorado that just

2884
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:40,590
could be baby being older or not being a

2885
02:27:38,639 --> 02:27:41,670
kid but it's [ __ ] with my head you

2886
02:27:40,590 --> 02:27:44,219
guys

2887
02:27:41,670 --> 02:27:46,069
these dark cold winter months you can't

2888
02:27:44,219 --> 02:27:48,478
go outside and do what you'd normally do

2889
02:27:46,069 --> 02:27:50,430
it's a little slower you got to get up

2890
02:27:48,478 --> 02:27:52,319
early for work you got a defrost the car

2891
02:27:50,430 --> 02:27:53,579
joe rogan put it best joe rogan said

2892
02:27:52,319 --> 02:27:56,459
there are states that are called he

2893
02:27:53,579 --> 02:27:57,629
calls them the [ __ ] states because when

2894
02:27:56,459 --> 02:27:58,859
you get in your car to go to work in the

2895
02:27:57,629 --> 02:28:00,839
morning you spend three or four minutes

2896
02:27:58,860 --> 02:28:02,939
sitting there going [ __ ] cuz you're so

2897
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:04,439
cold your body can't do anything stomach

2898
02:28:02,939 --> 02:28:06,030
muscles tighten up your brain starts

2899
02:28:04,439 --> 02:28:07,079
twitching your neck gets all stiff and

2900
02:28:06,030 --> 02:28:08,430
you just gotta wait for the car to

2901
02:28:07,079 --> 02:28:11,760
defrost and so that you could drive to

2902
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:13,110
work that [ __ ] sucks snow drives me

2903
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:15,450
crazy I don't like the cold I don't like

2904
02:28:13,110 --> 02:28:17,370
the snow it feels to make me it seems to

2905
02:28:15,450 --> 02:28:20,340
feel like it makes me weak and slow down

2906
02:28:17,370 --> 02:28:22,710
it makes my bones and muscles hurt I'm

2907
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:24,149
dealing with it I'm not enjoying the

2908
02:28:22,709 --> 02:28:25,319
winter I've got a lot of good friends I

2909
02:28:24,149 --> 02:28:26,520
do a lot of cool [ __ ] so don't let it

2910
02:28:25,319 --> 02:28:28,079
slow me down but I do feel it in the

2911
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:30,270
back of my head gone bro something sucks

2912
02:28:28,079 --> 02:28:32,340
and it's just this seasonal

2913
02:28:30,270 --> 02:28:33,930
effectiveness disorder I wanna talk

2914
02:28:32,340 --> 02:28:36,090
about a couple things that winter

2915
02:28:33,930 --> 02:28:37,470
depression comes along with and then

2916
02:28:36,090 --> 02:28:39,569
we'll move into the cannabis part of

2917
02:28:37,469 --> 02:28:41,579
this I did a little research says it

2918
02:28:39,569 --> 02:28:42,779
usually lasts from fall to spring ish so

2919
02:28:41,579 --> 02:28:44,819
if you're feeling a little funky from

2920
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:46,470
fall to spring this is probably why

2921
02:28:44,819 --> 02:28:49,020
especially if you live in these winter

2922
02:28:46,469 --> 02:28:51,029
colder climates some symptoms of this

2923
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:53,159
seasonal affective disorder include

2924
02:28:51,030 --> 02:28:55,079

depressed please get some help but if

02:29:32,189 --> 02:29:35,340
you think you've got some winter

2949
02:29:33,299 --> 02:29:37,039
seasonal depression we can help you with

2950
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:40,620
some cannabis suggestions another

2951
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:41,280
symptom here would be some laziness just

2952
02:29:40,620 --> 02:29:44,250
low-energy

2953
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:45,630
lethargy no no desire to get out of bed

2954
02:29:44,250 --> 02:29:47,309
you just want to lay around put some

2955
02:29:45,629 --> 02:29:49,289
blankets over you maybe plan your phone

2956
02:29:47,309 --> 02:29:53,100
and not do a damn thing losing interest

2957
02:29:49,290 --> 02:29:54,620
in life that's sort of the effect of the

2958
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:57,771
winter depression

2959
02:29:54,620 --> 02:30:00,170
um a lot of people have no desire to eat

2960
02:29:57,771 --> 02:30:01,880
when this winter depression comes on but

2961
02:30:00,170 --> 02:30:03,729
oddly enough the internet says that

2962
02:30:01,879 --> 02:30:06,259
people will seek foods like

2963
02:30:03,729 --> 02:30:07,939
carbohydrates and such during the winter

2964
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:10,010
which is odd for me because I always

2965
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:11,690
like carbs I like pizza and pasta and

2966
02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:14,389
[ __ ] but it says that you're gonna seek

2967
02:30:11,690 --> 02:30:16,640
out carbohydrate type salty foods if you

2968
02:30:14,389 --> 02:30:18,199
were experiencing seasonal effectiveness

2969
02:30:16,639 --> 02:30:22,369
this order it says you're gonna be

2970
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:24,829
agitated and irritable which I am there

2971
02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:27,050
that's partly how I'm noticing this I'm

2972
02:30:24,829 --> 02:30:28,789
partly I feel more tired I feel grouchy

2973
02:30:27,049 --> 02:30:30,529
I feel [ __ ] annoyed and I'm pretty

2974
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:32,620
sure that it's mostly just this seasonal

2975
02:30:30,530 --> 02:30:35,210
effectiveness effectiveness order

2976
02:30:32,620 --> 02:30:36,980
another thing that the internet said

2977
02:30:35,209 --> 02:30:38,600
that I totally relate to and this is

2978
02:30:36,979 --> 02:30:41,090
kind of what inspired me to want to talk

2979
02:30:38,601 --> 02:30:43,610
about this because it's part of where we

2980
02:30:41,090 --> 02:30:44,149
are in this new generation this new part

2981
02:30:43,610 --> 02:30:46,489
of life

2982
02:30:44,149 --> 02:30:50,270
they said the seasonal effectiveness

2983
02:30:46,489 --> 02:30:51,590
disorder comes with panic attacks and I

2984
02:30:50,271 --> 02:30:54,070
think there's a reason for these panic

2985
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:56,989
attacks that we're getting now as humans

2986
02:30:54,069 --> 02:31:00,649
we are too attached to our computers and

2987
02:30:56,989 --> 02:31:03,979
our devices and as humans we have become

2988
02:31:00,649 --> 02:31:06,590
completely lazy and complacent in the

2989
02:31:03,979 --> 02:31:10,039
winter I think that there's something

2990
02:31:06,590 --> 02:31:12,290
inside of me that gives me this trigger

2991
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:14,601
to go hunt and gather food and build a

2992
02:31:12,290 --> 02:31:17,271
fire so that I can keep the family warm

2993
02:31:14,601 --> 02:31:19,069
through the winter but now we all have

2994
02:31:17,271 --> 02:31:20,480
jobs that don't require most of us have

2995
02:31:19,069 --> 02:31:22,819
jobs that don't require that sort of

2996
02:31:20,479 --> 02:31:24,979
stuff I work in a grower I put a grow at

2997
02:31:22,819 --> 02:31:28,549
6:00 in the morning I do grow stuff I

2998
02:31:24,979 --> 02:31:30,770
leave there at 6 p.m. I come home I play

2999
02:31:28,549 --> 02:31:33,319
on my computer I live in a house I Drive

3000
02:31:30,771 --> 02:31:35,811
a car my food all comes from a store I

3001
02:31:33,319 --> 02:31:37,279
think that as humans we were supposed to

3002
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:39,229
we were designed and built to be out

3003
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:40,970
there hunting our food we should be I

3004
02:31:39,229 --> 02:31:42,529
should be out there chasing down deer or

3005
02:31:40,969 --> 02:31:45,079
Buffalo and killing that [ __ ] and

3006
02:31:42,530 --> 02:31:46,760
dragging it in and then skinning it and

3007
02:31:45,079 --> 02:31:48,079
cleaning yes I'm a vegetarian but I'm

3008
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:49,370
saying this this is part of why I think

3009
02:31:48,079 --> 02:31:51,771
humans are [ __ ] up because we're not

3010
02:31:49,370 --> 02:31:53,690
doing this there's something primal in

3011
02:31:51,771 --> 02:31:55,909
us that makes us supposed to do that and

3012
02:31:53,690 --> 02:31:57,771
in the winter that primal instinct to

3013
02:31:55,909 --> 02:31:59,780
survive becomes even stronger because

3014
02:31:57,771 --> 02:32:02,150
it's harder to survive and in the

3015
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:03,710
environment where I am it's even harder

3016
02:32:02,149 --> 02:32:05,029
because it snows I'm not saying that I'm

3017
02:32:03,709 --> 02:32:06,500
in the worst conditions but I mean we

3018
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:07,870
get snow and it's [ __ ] cold and if

3019
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:10,989
you don't have shelter and food

3020
02:32:07,870 --> 02:32:14,470
want you will die out there so our

3021
02:32:10,989 --> 02:32:16,449
inside our instinct our natural design

3022
02:32:14,469 --> 02:32:18,520
is to be hunting and gathering and

3023
02:32:16,450 --> 02:32:20,561
you're supposed to be using energy and

3024
02:32:18,521 --> 02:32:22,329
adrenaline and that anger that you feel

3025
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:24,729
you wouldn't feel that if you were

3026
02:32:22,329 --> 02:32:26,229
throwing a spear at another animal so

3027
02:32:24,729 --> 02:32:27,850
that you could survive you wouldn't have

3028
02:32:26,229 --> 02:32:29,889
time to be angry you wouldn't have time

3029
02:32:27,851 --> 02:32:31,840
to be depressed you'd be letting out all

3030
02:32:29,889 --> 02:32:33,579
that anger through adrenaline through

3031
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:35,380
hiking through stalking an animal

3032
02:32:33,579 --> 02:32:37,539
through or maybe through gardening if

3033
02:32:35,379 --> 02:32:39,489
you were a vegetarian back in the

3034
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:41,050
whatever times I'm talking about maybe

3035
02:32:39,489 --> 02:32:42,579
you had to spend all of that energy in

3036
02:32:41,049 --> 02:32:42,969
the garden and we're not doing that [ __ ]

3037
02:32:42,579 --> 02:32:44,620
anymore

3038
02:32:42,969 --> 02:32:46,899
we're sitting on computers and we're

3039
02:32:44,620 --> 02:32:49,540
playing video games and we're driving up

3040
02:32:46,899 --> 02:32:51,850
to a window to get our food I think a

3041
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:54,370
lot of that is kind of what's causing

3042
02:32:51,851 --> 02:32:56,470
the winter depression for a lot of the

3043
02:32:54,370 --> 02:32:57,790
males I'm not sure if this affects women

3044
02:32:56,469 --> 02:32:59,319
the same way I'm not trying to be sexist

3045
02:32:57,790 --> 02:33:01,360
I just know it's a testosterone thing

3046
02:32:59,319 --> 02:33:03,909
maybe women want to be hunters and

3047
02:33:01,360 --> 02:33:05,890
gatherers also maybe women suffer the

3048
02:33:03,909 --> 02:33:08,021
seasonal effectiveness disorder for the

3049
02:33:05,889 --> 02:33:09,699
same reasons but differently I'm not

3050
02:33:08,021 --> 02:33:11,620
sure this part is my opinion the panic

3051
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:15,340
attacks and the hunting rent is all my

3052
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:16,480
my own opinion here but I think we

3053
02:33:15,340 --> 02:33:17,829
should be using our energy and I'm gonna

3054
02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:20,590
start talking about now about things

3055
02:33:17,829 --> 02:33:23,379
that we can do to help ourselves with

3056
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:25,649
this seasonal effectiveness disorder I

3057
02:33:23,379 --> 02:33:28,239
already talked about being active

3058
02:33:25,649 --> 02:33:30,639
exercise get out there and do something

3059
02:33:28,239 --> 02:33:31,810
I hypothetically saying I feel like we

3060
02:33:30,639 --> 02:33:34,029
should be hunting we should be chasing

3061
02:33:31,810 --> 02:33:36,250
down an elk or a deer and then we gotta

3062
02:33:34,030 --> 02:33:38,470
kill it with either spear or a bow and

3063
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:40,030
arrow a recurve bow and you gotta go

3064
02:33:38,469 --> 02:33:41,319
drag that [ __ ] back to camp and then you

3065
02:33:40,030 --> 02:33:44,079
got to skin it you got to get everything

3066
02:33:41,319 --> 02:33:46,029
out then fire I think being around a

3067
02:33:44,079 --> 02:33:48,010
fire makes me feel really good like a

3068
02:33:46,030 --> 02:33:50,050
campfire something inside of a campfire

3069
02:33:48,010 --> 02:33:53,290
really fixes me especially in this cold

3070
02:33:50,049 --> 02:33:56,799
weather so get out there and be active

3071
02:33:53,290 --> 02:33:59,050
build a campfire go camping go hunting

3072
02:33:56,799 --> 02:34:00,369
if you're that type of person be

3073
02:33:59,049 --> 02:34:02,920
physical something I can really

3074
02:34:00,370 --> 02:34:05,190
recommend to get you out of a seasonal

3075
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:08,260
affective disorder kind of a funk is

3076
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:10,989
join some sort of organized martial art

3077
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:12,430
or fighting be physical use your body I

3078
02:34:10,989 --> 02:34:15,601
think a lot of what's causing this is

3079
02:34:12,430 --> 02:34:18,190
pent up body energy from the winter so

3080
02:34:15,601 --> 02:34:19,989
get out there and use your body go join

3081
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:21,370
a Brazilian jiu-jitsu class go join a

3082
02:34:19,989 --> 02:34:23,170
martial arts class go be a

3083
02:34:21,370 --> 02:34:25,780
Resler if you're not into that go do

3084
02:34:23,170 --> 02:34:27,840
some yoga just use your body use some

3085
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:31,090
energy I think it'll really help you out

3086
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:32,590
so now let's start talking about before

3087
02:34:31,090 --> 02:34:33,399
I get to smoking cannabis honestly go

3088
02:34:32,590 --> 02:34:34,840
for a drive

3089
02:34:33,399 --> 02:34:36,430
put on some music and go for a drive

3090
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:37,750
that always fixes my head when I'm a

3091
02:34:36,430 --> 02:34:39,880
little bit funky ah

3092
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:41,590
put on your favorite music some reggae

3093
02:34:39,879 --> 02:34:43,000
whatever you're into if you're into some

3094
02:34:41,590 --> 02:34:44,351
metal put on some metal turn it up a

3095
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,790
little bit to lime just go for a drive

3096
02:34:44,351 --> 02:34:46,989
that'll fix your head but I wanted to

3097
02:34:45,790 --> 02:34:48,311
say go for a drive before I start

3098
02:34:46,989 --> 02:34:50,139
talking about consuming cannabis because

3099
02:34:48,310 --> 02:34:51,129
Michael flip out if I say smoke a joint

3100
02:34:50,139 --> 02:34:54,310
go for a drive it'll make you feel

3101
02:34:51,129 --> 02:34:56,979
better so let's talk about other things

3102
02:34:54,310 --> 02:34:59,770
cannabis this is how cannabis can truly

3103
02:34:56,979 --> 02:35:02,680
help with the seasonal effectiveness

3104
02:34:59,771 --> 02:35:05,590
disorder I think that's smoking sativa

3105
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:08,560
dominant cannabis either flowers or dabs

3106
02:35:05,590 --> 02:35:10,271
are going to help fix your mood I've got

3107
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:12,399
a short list of strains here that I've

3108
02:35:10,271 --> 02:35:14,739
experimented with personally that I have

3109
02:35:12,399 --> 02:35:17,079
found to help uplift my mood and not

3110
02:35:14,739 --> 02:35:19,149
make me too anxious or jittery and still

3111
02:35:17,079 --> 02:35:21,819
allow me to function and get my job done

3112
02:35:19,149 --> 02:35:23,379
and still be like a normal person would

3113
02:35:21,819 --> 02:35:26,020
still have a nice buzz and nobody could

3114
02:35:23,379 --> 02:35:28,289
tell how high I am so on this list

3115
02:35:26,021 --> 02:35:30,820
number one on this list is Jilly bean

3116
02:35:28,290 --> 02:35:31,390
Jilly bean has always put me in a good

3117
02:35:30,819 --> 02:35:33,459
mood

3118
02:35:31,389 --> 02:35:34,989
it's uplifting it makes me walk with a

3119
02:35:33,459 --> 02:35:37,270
nice little pep in my step it puts a

3120
02:35:34,989 --> 02:35:39,879
grin on my face Jilly bean will wipe out

3121
02:35:37,271 --> 02:35:41,230
any anxiety depression it'll calm me

3122
02:35:39,879 --> 02:35:43,750
down and put you in a good mood

3123
02:35:41,229 --> 02:35:45,039
the next one on that list is tangi yes a

3124
02:35:43,750 --> 02:35:46,750
lot of people are gonna say jelly bean

3125
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:48,521
and tangi are the same thing they're

3126
02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:50,021
very similar strains they have very

3127
02:35:48,521 --> 02:35:52,630
similar qualities they taste very

3128
02:35:50,021 --> 02:35:55,540
similarly they grow similarly I think

3129
02:35:52,629 --> 02:35:57,549
they both put a smile on my face the

3130
02:35:55,540 --> 02:36:00,190
next brand on my list is tangerine haze

3131
02:35:57,549 --> 02:36:01,959
from soma this is actually sohmas New

3132
02:36:00,190 --> 02:36:04,989
York City Diesel but there is a

3133
02:36:01,959 --> 02:36:08,770
phenotype that tastes very tangerine and

3134
02:36:04,989 --> 02:36:10,119
orange II that tangerine haze is always

3135
02:36:08,771 --> 02:36:11,440
been I used to call it my morning

3136
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:12,910
breakfast smoke I'd be like I need my

3137
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:14,620
morning oranges and I would smoke some

3138
02:36:12,909 --> 02:36:16,690
Selma's tangerine haze or his New York

3139
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:18,940
City Diesel known as tangerine haze so

3140
02:36:16,690 --> 02:36:21,460
there's a group back in the day known as

3141
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:23,620
a devil's harvest crew and they grew a

3142
02:36:21,459 --> 02:36:26,770
bunch of stuff and they found a very

3143
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:28,150
orangey phenotype very orange phenotype

3144
02:36:26,771 --> 02:36:30,070
of the New York City sour

3145
02:36:28,149 --> 02:36:31,149
sohma's diesel and they passed that

3146
02:36:30,069 --> 02:36:32,469
around and called a tangerine haze

3147
02:36:31,149 --> 02:36:34,000
that's where it got the name and I found

3148
02:36:32,469 --> 02:36:35,949
the same phenotype out of a packet

3149
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:37,149
grew it and I loved it and it always

3150
02:36:35,950 --> 02:36:39,850
used to put a smile on my face so I

3151
02:36:37,149 --> 02:36:43,180
think those top three that I listed are

3152
02:36:39,850 --> 02:36:45,640
very orangie very citrusy very sativa

3153
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:47,170
yet very light strains when you smoke

3154
02:36:45,639 --> 02:36:49,000
them when I smoke them I don't get super

3155
02:36:47,170 --> 02:36:51,219
high I can't get high as [ __ ] off either

3156
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,739
of those three strains but I can catch a

3157
02:36:51,219 --> 02:36:56,109
really killer smiley buzz so something

3158
02:36:53,739 --> 02:36:57,969

uplifting and puts me in a good mood but

3171
02:37:23,290 --> 02:37:27,190

3172
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:28,720

3173

sativa this may be a little too much but

3175
02:37:31,090 --> 02:37:36,040
the jack herer has always been a good

3176

strain for me it changes my mood it

3177
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:38,650

it keeps me upbeat and it makes me

3179
02:37:38,649 --> 02:37:42,609
social but it can drive your head a

3180
02:37:40,989 --> 02:37:44,199
little crazy if you're somebody that

3181
02:37:42,610 --> 02:37:46,329
gets too talkative when you smoke too

3182
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:49,180
much cannabis Jack may not be the cross

3183

02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:59,920
in a good mood and you guys are gonna be

3189
02:37:58,600 --> 02:38:01,450
surprised that I say this because I've

3190
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:03,850
made plenty of jokes about it but Blue

3191
02:38:01,450 --> 02:38:05,500
Dream Blue Dream is always a good strain

3192
02:38:03,850 --> 02:38:08,350
for putting you in a good mood for

3193
02:38:05,500 --> 02:38:09,760
changing your vibe it's not one of those

3194
02:38:08,350 --> 02:38:11,200
strains that makes you like want to curl

3195
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:12,909
up into a ball when you get to high

3196
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:16,540
because I've seen people want to do that

3197
02:38:12,909 --> 02:38:18,729
blue dream is you can't get to - blue

3198
02:38:16,540 --> 02:38:20,170
dream and it's a nice mellow buzz that's

3199
02:38:18,729 --> 02:38:22,119
why I make fun of blue dream I call it

3200
02:38:20,170 --> 02:38:23,290
stripper weed because it's that's how

3201
02:38:22,120 --> 02:38:24,820
high strippers want to get strippers

3202
02:38:23,290 --> 02:38:26,140
doing if I got high as [ __ ] like I do

3203
02:38:24,819 --> 02:38:27,549
strippers just want to get a little

3204
02:38:26,139 --> 02:38:28,809
buzzed you know spend on the pole I'm

3205
02:38:27,549 --> 02:38:30,879
just joking but that's why I called

3206
02:38:28,809 --> 02:38:32,379
stripper weed so basically any kind of a

3207
02:38:30,879 --> 02:38:35,439
haze cross you guys most of what I've

3208
02:38:32,379 --> 02:38:37,899
mentioned has a haze in it also Jack the

3209
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:39,550
Ripper Jack Herer and Jack the Ripper

3210
02:38:37,899 --> 02:38:41,379
have a lot of the same parents Jack the

3211
02:38:39,549 --> 02:38:43,269
Ripper is a cross of Jack Herer I

3212
02:38:41,379 --> 02:38:46,089
strongly recommend some Jack the Ripper

3213
02:38:43,270 --> 02:38:47,800
but like I said about the hair it could

3214
02:38:46,090 --> 02:38:49,840
be a bit much for you you guys could

3215
02:38:47,799 --> 02:38:52,239
make some people's head spin if you're

3216
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:53,620
not an experienced smoker so if you're

3217
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:56,350
trying to beat seasonal effectiveness

3218
02:38:53,620 --> 02:38:58,329
disorder and you are able to take a

3219
02:38:56,350 --> 02:39:00,280
strong heavy sativa dose and you like to

3220
02:38:58,329 --> 02:39:02,260
get kind of whirlwind high grab yourself

3221
02:39:00,280 --> 02:39:04,420
some Jack the Ripper it's available at a

3222
02:39:02,260 --> 02:39:06,790
lot of dispensaries it's a great tasting

3223
02:39:04,420 --> 02:39:08,620
cannabis it has a great high to it and

3224
02:39:06,790 --> 02:39:11,140
it's usually pretty easy to find because

3225
02:39:08,620 --> 02:39:12,819
sub cool is a very popular breeder since

3226
02:39:11,139 --> 02:39:16,719
we're talking about sub cool I'm gonna

3227
02:39:12,818 --> 02:39:18,639
mention vortex I used to get some vortex

3228
02:39:16,719 --> 02:39:20,379
it was waxed but it was kind of there

3229
02:39:18,639 --> 02:39:22,689
was a different texture of wax from a

3230
02:39:20,379 --> 02:39:24,909
dispensary in Denver and I loved the

3231
02:39:22,689 --> 02:39:26,739
high from it it made me it gave me

3232
02:39:24,909 --> 02:39:28,389
tunnel vision high to where I couldn't

3233
02:39:26,739 --> 02:39:30,609
pay attention to anything except what

3234
02:39:28,389 --> 02:39:33,579
was right in front of me but it also put

3235
02:39:30,609 --> 02:39:35,229
this stupidest smile on my face I really

3236
02:39:33,579 --> 02:39:37,689
love the way that vortex made me feel

3237
02:39:35,228 --> 02:39:40,478
again vortex if you were not an

3238
02:39:37,689 --> 02:39:43,510
experienced vortex made my heart race it

3239
02:39:40,478 --> 02:39:45,219
made my heart was going but I love it

3240
02:39:43,510 --> 02:39:47,648
there's something about being too high

3241
02:39:45,219 --> 02:39:50,349
like that that I really really enjoy um

3242
02:39:47,648 --> 02:39:52,959
another strain that is good for the

3243
02:39:50,350 --> 02:39:54,909
seasonal affective disorder is the lemon

3244
02:39:52,959 --> 02:39:56,559
Jeffrey that's a golden goat cross -

3245
02:39:54,909 --> 02:39:58,689
it's actually lemon skunk crossed a

3246
02:39:56,559 --> 02:40:01,239
golden goat i bred that one it is one of

3247
02:39:58,689 --> 02:40:04,270
my favorites to smoke it has been tested

3248
02:40:01,239 --> 02:40:06,039
in the 30% range for THC it is

3249
02:40:04,270 --> 02:40:08,020
definitely a head changer something

3250
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:10,390
about the orange and lemon Terps the

3251
02:40:08,020 --> 02:40:12,970
limonene Terps really create like a good

3252
02:40:10,389 --> 02:40:15,279
mood a good vibe so I think things that

3253
02:40:12,969 --> 02:40:17,349
smell like oranges smell like fruit

3254
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:19,840
smell like lemons are usually going to

3255
02:40:17,350 --> 02:40:22,149
be uplifting positive vibe kind of

3256
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:24,309
strains I think most of the haze crosses

3257
02:40:22,148 --> 02:40:26,680
and the tangi and Jillybean crosses are

3258
02:40:24,309 --> 02:40:29,289
usually going to be good to put you into

3259
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:31,479
a good mood so those restraints that I

3260
02:40:29,290 --> 02:40:35,290
can recommend for smoking if they are

3261
02:40:31,478 --> 02:40:36,849
available where you are if smoking isn't

3262
02:40:35,290 --> 02:40:38,939
something for you and if you're not

3263
02:40:36,850 --> 02:40:42,250
getting the desired effect from smoking

3264
02:40:38,939 --> 02:40:43,960
edibles may be a better route to go body

3265
02:40:42,250 --> 02:40:45,939
chemistry is all different so if you're

3266
02:40:43,959 --> 02:40:48,669
trying to fight depression or seasonal

3267
02:40:45,939 --> 02:40:52,359
affective depression maybe you need high

3268
02:40:48,670 --> 02:40:54,520
THC maybe you need CBD I would kind of

3269
02:40:52,359 --> 02:40:57,060
stay away from the indicas what happens

3270
02:40:54,520 --> 02:40:59,489
to me and I have

3271
02:40:57,060 --> 02:41:01,140
go in history because now I smoke so

3272
02:40:59,489 --> 02:41:03,329
much and my tolerance is so high and I'm

3273
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:05,460
older and I'm more used to being high

3274
02:41:03,329 --> 02:41:07,261
out of my mind when I was younger and

3275
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:09,060
was new in cannabis when I would smoke

3276
02:41:07,261 --> 02:41:10,921
sativas I would get that real

3277
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:11,940
psychedelic high and get talkative sort

3278
02:41:10,921 --> 02:41:13,229
of like I am now I'm just [ __ ]

3279
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:15,091
rambling and talking about everything

3280
02:41:13,229 --> 02:41:17,520
but then when I would smoke indicas I

3281
02:41:15,091 --> 02:41:18,961
would go in my head and get quiet and

3282
02:41:17,521 --> 02:41:20,400
that's when you just sit in a chair and

3283
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:22,501
you start thinking too much and I would

3284
02:41:20,399 --> 02:41:24,029
kind of sometimes you could drive

3285
02:41:22,501 --> 02:41:25,409
yourself crazy thinking too much when

3286
02:41:24,030 --> 02:41:27,601
you're already in the seasonal

3287
02:41:25,409 --> 02:41:29,761
effectiveness disorder kind of head

3288
02:41:27,601 --> 02:41:31,051
state smoking an indica that's gonna put

3289
02:41:29,761 --> 02:41:32,761
you into your own head and make you

3290
02:41:31,050 --> 02:41:34,380
think may [ __ ] you up a little more than

3291
02:41:32,761 --> 02:41:36,659
you need it may cause more depression it

3292
02:41:34,380 --> 02:41:38,609
may cause self-doubt it may cause

3293
02:41:36,659 --> 02:41:41,130
confusion it may not be the thing that

3294
02:41:38,610 --> 02:41:43,921
you need so I would go for some sativa

3295
02:41:41,130 --> 02:41:46,079
edibles or CB CBD edibles but I would

3296
02:41:43,921 --> 02:41:49,319
definitely stay away from the indica

3297
02:41:46,079 --> 02:41:51,870
dominant stuff because I think the most

3298
02:41:49,319 --> 02:41:54,569
reliable cure for seasonal affective

3299
02:41:51,870 --> 02:41:57,329
disorder is to smoke a joint and go for

3300
02:41:54,569 --> 02:41:58,890
a hike find a nice safe hiking spot roll

3301
02:41:57,329 --> 02:42:01,261
yourself up a nice joint of your

3302
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:02,850
favorite strain either the Jilly bean or

3303
02:42:01,261 --> 02:42:04,591
some lemon Jeffrey or whatever you can

3304
02:42:02,851 --> 02:42:06,870
find that fits in the list that I talked

3305
02:42:04,591 --> 02:42:09,450
about it's yourself a nice sativa joint

3306
02:42:06,870 --> 02:42:11,551
roll it up take one of your best friends

3307
02:42:09,450 --> 02:42:14,070
with you take your dog with you get a

3308
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:15,630
bottle of water go for a walk smoke a

3309
02:42:14,069 --> 02:42:17,761
joint and fix your head

3310
02:42:15,630 --> 02:42:19,109
keep in mind you guys it's okay to feel

3311
02:42:17,761 --> 02:42:20,489
this way everybody's gonna deal with

3312
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:21,751
some [ __ ] in their life it's all right

3313
02:42:20,489 --> 02:42:24,239
to feel kind of funky once in a while

3314
02:42:21,751 --> 02:42:25,950
just don't be a dick try to deal with it

3315
02:42:24,239 --> 02:42:27,479
properly and pull yourself through it

3316
02:42:25,950 --> 02:42:29,400
hopefully when the spring comes you'll

3317
02:42:27,479 --> 02:42:31,050
start cheering up again hopefully by the

3318
02:42:29,399 --> 02:42:32,369
time 420 rolls around you'll be in a

3319
02:42:31,050 --> 02:42:33,720
good mood and then summer is coming back

3320
02:42:32,370 --> 02:42:35,370
and then it's time to get in a good mood

3321
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:37,439
again hopefully you can figure it out

3322
02:42:35,370 --> 02:42:38,851
not go through it again next year are

3323
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:42,001
you guys that was my quick talk on

3324
02:42:38,851 --> 02:42:43,681
seasonal effectiveness disorder I hope I

3325
02:42:42,001 --> 02:42:45,149
was helpful I hope I could guide you in

3326
02:42:43,681 --> 02:42:46,711
the right way to select cannabis to keep

3327
02:42:45,149 --> 02:42:48,390
you in a good mood hey even if you're

3328
02:42:46,710 --> 02:42:49,649
not suffering through some seasonal

3329
02:42:48,390 --> 02:42:51,149
depression all of these strains would

3330
02:42:49,649 --> 02:42:53,100
probably put a smile on your face keep

3331
02:42:51,149 --> 02:42:54,449
you social if you have to go to lunch

3332

lunch with if you've got to do a chore

3334
02:42:55,829 --> 02:42:58,860

3335
02:42:57,569 --> 02:43:00,119
smoking one of these strains and just

3336
02:42:58,860 --> 02:43:01,829
