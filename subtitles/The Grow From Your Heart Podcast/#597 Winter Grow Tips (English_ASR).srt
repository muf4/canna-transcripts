83
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,959
where do we go from there

84
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,640
let's jump right into the main topic of

85
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,280
this episode it is a nice

86
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,279
cold colorado evening i think the uh the

87
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,199
monitor said it was 17 degrees outside

88
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,318
when i looked at the security cameras

89
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,719
that is frosty cold i wanted to update

90
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,318
a thing i said on a previous episode in

91
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,000
a previous episode i mentioned

92
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,839
getting your plants up off of the grow

93
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,959
room floor that grow room floor is super

94
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,560
cold in the winter

95
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,840
i could be super cold in the winter i'm

96
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,318
not sure where you are or what you're

97
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,479
doing

98
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,479
my grow room floor is really cold in the

99
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,799
winter time so it's always a good idea

100
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,799
to get my plants up off of the floor a

101
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,480
lot of people will use a pallet a lot of

102
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
people use a cinder block some people

103
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,159
use another pot flipped upside down

104
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,000
as long as we are getting those pods up

105
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,759
off the ground so the root zone isn't

106
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,959
super cold we are giving our plants

107
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,799
a little bit of help or setting

108
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
ourselves up for success

109
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,480
think about that cold pot sitting on the

110
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
floor it's nice and cold then we pour

111
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,000
water into it that water makes it even

112
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,359
colder the plant can't go anywhere

113
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
it's going to get pissed off so let's

114
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,200
get those plants up off the floor

115
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,878
and keep them nice and warm something

116
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,000
that i was inspired by that

117
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:22,639
episode was to tell you to put your ez

118
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,439
cloner or your turbo cloner on that cold

119
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,119
floor

120
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,239
uh just to give you an idea of what i'm

121
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,719
talking about if you're not following

122
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
along

123
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,959
a lot of us use a turbo cloner or an ez

124
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,719
cloner or a power cloner to make our

125
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,719
clones it is a clone machine

126
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,239
you fill a reservoir with water you put

127
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,759
a pump inside of that reservoir that

128
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,599
reservoir has a manifold

129
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,280
with multiple sprayers that spray water

130
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,158
at an upward angle toward the bottom of

131
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,759
our plants

132
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,759
it's got a lid on it you fill the lid

133
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,759
with clones the bottoms of the clones

134
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,359
hang down into that spraying area

135
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,878
they get misted with that water and they

136
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,200
make roots

137
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,000
the pump inside of that cloner will heat

138
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,560
up the water

139
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
quite rapidly in a normal environment i

140
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
would run that

141
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,438
pump for about 50 minutes and then turn

142
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,959
it off for 10 minutes so every hour it

143
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,598
gets a 10 minute rest cycle

144
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,120
to let the heat of that water cool down

145
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,639
the water is getting heated by the pump

146
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,640
the water is naturally warm because it's

147
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,318
in that grow that warm grow area

148
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,000
so it's going to heat up quite quickly

149
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,159
inside that little reservoir

150
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,918
a way we can avoid that in the winter is

151
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
to simply take that clone machine and

152
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,198
put it on

153
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,478
our cold grow room floor that will keep

154
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,079
that water nice and cool that will

155
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,599
mitigate some of the heat created by

156
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,839
that pump and that will keep your clones

157
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
nice and happy

158
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,359
this will also prevent in a little bit

159
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,280
of the evaporation of the water you

160
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
won't have to adjust your ph and your ec

161
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,918
as frequently

162
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,079
so that will help you out make sure to

163
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,079
check the ec and the ph of your cloner

164
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,680
on a daily basis make sure you add clear

165
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,439
res every five days

166
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,879
but if the water is a little cooler it

167
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,959
won't evaporate as much

168
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,560
so we won't need to make as many

169
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,399
critical adjustments

170
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,959
something to pay attention to is don't

171
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,079
let it get too cold i think 69 degrees

172
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,000
and above is good

173
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,680
for our water and our turbo cloner and

174
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,439
for our plants in general

175
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,038
you may want to go a little higher you

176
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,680
may want to go a little cooler but

177
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,800
my rule of thumb is 69 degrees is as

178
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,478
cool as i want to go

179
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,478
i don't want to go much cooler than that

180
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,918
that will start slowing down the root

181
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:10,879
development and the health of your

182
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,799
plants so

183
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,560
the first tip for the winter is if you

184
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,120
are using an easy cloner or a clone

185
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
machine

186
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,879
and the water is heating up too rapidly

187
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,198
take that clone machine and set it

188
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,159
right on the cold grow room floor that

189
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,840
cold is free

190
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,439
it's right there waiting for you and it

191
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,959
is there to solve a problem so this

192
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,120
episode is going to be about

193
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,239
uh using the things in our grow room

194
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,079
that we've already got

195
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
to create the best environment and best

196
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,839
conditions we can with what we've got

197
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,519
we've spent a lot of money on equipment

198
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,000
we've spent a lot of time planning this

199
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,000
out

200
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,160
let's try to learn to adapt to each

201
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,800
season and use the gear wisely to get

202
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,439
the best outcomes in our grow room

203
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,038
another big tip i've got for you the

204
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,959
water coming out of the faucet in the

205
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,639
winter is going to be cold the pipes are

206
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,758
outside underground it's cold as [ __ ]

207
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,319
out there that water is going to come

208
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,000
out of the

209
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,079
the faucet really cold it's going to be

210
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,038
in the 40s and 50s maybe in the 60s

211
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,879
depending on

212
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,318
how cold it is in your environment

213
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,079
everything i'm saying is fahrenheit by

214
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,439
the way i am in america we go by

215
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,240
fahrenheit if you're in canada or

216
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,839
somewhere else

217
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
you can adjust you got to do the math i

218
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,599
do apologize i'm speaking in fahrenheit

219
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,038
terms today let me make that clear

220
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,199
so the water coming out of the faucet in

221
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,719
the winter is going to be 60 degrees

222
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
i've said before we don't want to feed

223
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
the plants anything that's 69 degrees or

224
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,880
cooler

225
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,079
so why not fill your reservoir up today

226
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,240
before you've got to water in the

227
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,639
morning drag the reservoir into the grow

228
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,918
room

229
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,879
put it underneath the grow lights it

230
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,000
doesn't have to go right under the

231
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,439
lights where the plants are if you've

232
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,279
got some extra space in your grow

233
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,800
environment for your reservoir

234
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,478
roll that reservoir right into the grow

235
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,478
room and let it get heated up by the

236
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,359
grow room overnight that way when we go

237
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,199
in there to water

238
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,560
you've got water that is the same

239
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,000
temperature as the room

240
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,360
in which the plants are in that way

241
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,879
we're not giving them any shock not

242
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,479
giving them any problems

243
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,879
not dipping their feet in that cold

244
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,318
water be nice to your plants you expect

245
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,560
a positive outcome from them

246
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,520
let's not torture them by pouring icy

247
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
cold water

248
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,439
over their feets alright so fill up that

249
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,639
reservoir the night before the day

250
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,399
before if possible

251
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,079
and let it get warmed up if you can't

252
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,399
get it warm enough by the time you need

253
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,399
to use it i recommend an aquarium heater

254
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,000
you can get those glass aquarium heaters

255
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,079
drop it right in the water plug it in

256
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,319
set yourself a timer put your most of

257
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,758
the good the blue lab ec and ph meters

258
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,120
have a thermometer on there

259
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,479
just drop that in there let it float

260
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,918
around when you're walking around the

261
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,120
ground doing your chores just check on

262
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,399
it give it a little stir

263
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,160
see what the ph of that or the

264
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,918
temperature of that water is

265
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,759
then when it's heated up appropriately

266
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,279
unplug the heater clean the heater off

267
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,680
they gather a lot of sediment clean them

268
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,239
off

269
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,319
put it away save it for next time always

270
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,918
adjust the ph after the water is at room

271
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,800
temperature right before you feed it to

272
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,038
the plants

273
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
if it's cold the water will get warm and

274
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,120
the ph will change if it's hot it will

275
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,960
cool down and the ph will change

276
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,478
adjust the ph when it is at the

277
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,758
temperature at which you are going to

278
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,918
feed it to the plants

279
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,520
it will be that ph when it goes into

280
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,120
your plants at that time don't adjust it

281
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,560
when it's cold because it will fluctuate

282
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,598
don't adjust it when it's hot because it

283
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,360
will fluctuate

284
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,839
when it adjusts to room temperature so

285
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,400
adjust your ph at room temperature

286
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,279
then feed it to your plants now here are

287
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,519
a couple of other

288
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,279
useful tips and tricks to do with

289
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,719
ducting and venting in the grow room it

290
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,719
is nice and cold

291
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
perhaps you've got two grow spaces

292
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,319
perhaps you've got a flowering space

293
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
that runs for 12 hours on and 12 hours

294
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,639
off

295
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,240
then you've probably got a veg space

296
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,120
that runs for 16 on

297
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
8 off or 18 on and 6 off maybe 24 on if

298
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,478
you're one of those people

299
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,079
i do a 19 and 5 because that makes my

300
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,598
mother plants grow and i'm sure that the

301
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,959
big mother plants won't

302
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,800
try to autoflower on me if they're

303
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,958
getting root bound or something and it

304
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,879
does give them four hours to sleep

305
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,399
i recommend at least a four hour sleep

306
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,519
period or gives them five hours my math

307
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,599
was terrible there

308
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,278
i recommend some sleep period for your

309
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,680
plants it lets your plants sleep it lets

310
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,519
the

311
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,278
the root zone and the microbes happen in

312
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,159
the dark zone all that activity happens

313
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,838
in the night time

314
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,000
so let them sleep get some night time

315
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,440
also it gives your equipment some rest

316
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,120
all those lights have been running all

317
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,399
day all of your fans your blowers

318
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,000
everything has been running

319
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,759
if you can turn a few things off for a

320
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,679
four hour for a four hour period

321
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,039
you're saving electricity you're saving

322
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,039
time on your equipment which will give

323
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,879
you longevity out of that equipment

324
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,719
and like i said everything wants a nap

325
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,639
if i ran you for 24 hours a day and

326
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,560
never gave you any dark time

327
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,879
you may show some kind of signs of

328
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,319
psycho eventually some psychosis some

329
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,080
some craziness will come out of you so

330
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,920
everything wants a nap give those plants

331
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,000
a little nap give your gear a nap

332
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,838
utilize the nap time of your gear what

333
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
i'm getting at is when the flower room

334
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,040
goes off in the winter time it may get a

335
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,480
bit cold in there

336
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,159
when those lights shut off the

337
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,399
temperatures will drop

338
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,519
something i do is i duct the heat from

339
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,839
my veg room

340
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,278
into the flower room at night time so i

341
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,959
can keep that flower room

342
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,240
a little bit warmer than it would be

343
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,599
without heat that way i don't have to

344
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,120
buy a heater to put in there

345
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,720
i'm using the heat that's already being

346
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,919
created in one room by the lights that

347
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,519
are constantly on

348
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,919
i'm just dumping that heat right into

349
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,080
another room so learn to utilize

350
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,838
the heat that you don't want in one area

351
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,040
put it in another area that way you can

352
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,080
keep one room cool

353
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,439
one room will be at the right

354
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,278
temperature and you don't have to buy a

355
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,800
heater to keep that flower ring

356
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,320
room cool something else i do sometimes

357
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,000
if it's the right temperature if it

358
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
works out just right i will duct the

359
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,799
heat

360
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
from the flowering room into a portion

361
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,439
of my home

362
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,120
and spread that out throughout the house

363
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
to keep the entire house warm if you've

364
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,600
got a smaller house this will work

365
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,360
beautifully

366
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,200
a couple or a few thousand watt lights

367
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,039
will heat up a room quite quickly if

368
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,480
you've got a 10 by 10 room with 4 000

369
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,120
watt lights you're cranking out a bunch

370
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,639
of heat

371
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,480
instead of ducting that stuff right

372
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,480
outside of the house duct that into your

373
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,079
bedroom duct that into your living room

374
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
duct it into the basement and let it

375
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,319
rise into the rest of the house heat

376
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,399
rises

377
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
think about moving that warm air around

378
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,958
you can save yourself on hvac costs

379
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,640
heating

380
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,039
ventilation air conditioning costs can

381
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,958
go down if you learn how to duct the air

382
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,799
that you're already creating duct that

383
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,559
warm air to a useful

384
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,240
spot of the house to the grow wherever

385
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,679
you need it learn to move that air

386
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,278
around and utilize it that way we don't

387
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,278
have to spend more money on heat

388
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,799
there's already heat let's use it let's

389
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,399
get warm with it

390
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,719
so you can duck that heat straight from

391
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,159
either your flower room or your bedroom

392
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,920
right into your house right into your

393
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,439
bedroom if you've got a bedroom that

394
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,958
gets kind of cold at night

395
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,240
if your basement doesn't get warm enough

396
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,639
if part of the house doesn't get warm

397
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
enough

398
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,838
run that ducting right to there and just

399
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,440
duct that heat into

400
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,200
the coldest part of the house warm

401
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,240
yourself up it's kind of like recycling

402
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,759
you're saving money

403
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,440
and it's grow room heat that needs to go

404
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,399
somewhere anyway send it some more

405
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,120
useful

406
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,839
what else can we do there is humidity to

407
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,839
be dealt with

408
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,760
a lot of times the flower room will make

409
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,640
a lot of humidity you got big flowering

410
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,240
plants in there

411
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,759
you got a bunch of humidity going on you

412
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
just fed if you've got four

413
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,679
lights in there you got four seven

414
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,279
gallon pots per light that's going to be

415
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,639
a lot of humidity when you water those

416
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:35,439
plants maybe you got more in there maybe

417
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,199
you got less

418
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
we're going to create humidity my point

419
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,680
is let's learn to duct that humidity

420
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,838
from the flowering room into the

421
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,199
vegetative room the veg room loves high

422
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,880
humidity you're not going to run into

423
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
nearly as many problems with a veg room

424
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,919
with high humidity

425
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,078
as you would a flowering room with high

426
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,958
humidity so let's put a blower at the

427
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,039
top of the room

428
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,399
or a duct at the top of the room that'll

429
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,519
suck all that humidity because the

430
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,120
humidity is at the top

431
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,959
let's suck that heat and humidity out of

432
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,000
that room and move it right into the veg

433
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,518
space

434
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,839
all you need is a four inch blower and

435
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,600
some ducting if you want to use a

436
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,959
humidistat that will tell you how much

437
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,040
humidity is in the room

438
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,559
you can set a humidistat to say when it

439
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,078
gets to 70 or 80

440
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,759
humidity i'm just guessing random

441
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,439
numbers it's got a dial on it when you

442
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,879
get it to that when it hits that setting

443
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
it'll kick on and it will move your

444
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,240
humidity when it gets past that

445
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,319
threshold it'll turn it right off it's a

446
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,879
switch that plugs into the wall you turn

447
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,399
a dial

448
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,919
you set it to the amount you want then

449
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,120
you plug your blower into there

450
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,278
there's a sensor that hangs in the

451
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,039
middle of the room and it says oh 80

452
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,320
humidity i better turn on this blower

453
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,240
and it'll blow that duct

454
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,160
it'll blow that uh air right through the

455
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
duct right into your bedroom and now

456
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,199
your bedroom gets a little extra

457
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,560
humidity and you don't cause problems in

458
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,720
the flowering area

459
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,719
it's all about utilizing what is already

460
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
there with minimal equipment this will

461
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
save you problems this will save you

462
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,399
money

463
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,000
you probably bought a bunch of excess

464
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,360
gear that you didn't need anyway because

465
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,278
people get excited when they build their

466
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,720
grows let's learn to use that

467
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:01,039
to our advantage um also

468
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,480
a lot of people this is kind of old

469
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,078
school tech but a lot of people are

470
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,639
still doing the old school tech a lot of

471
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:06,799
people have

472
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,839
ducted lights vented lights so you've

473
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,958
got a light

474
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,399
i'm going to try to explain this the

475
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,518
best i can you got a light fixture that

476
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,078
hangs from the ceiling

477
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,919
it is a square fixture the bottom part

478
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,519
has glass under it so there's a bulb

479
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,199
inside of there but instead of sealing

480
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,399
that bottom we put glass in there so the

481
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,160
light can shine through the glass and

482
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,078
illuminate the grow room

483
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,838
they put a hole on one side of the box

484
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,000
and a hole on the other side of the box

485
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,680
and we can run ducting across that that

486
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,360
way we can move the heat away from the

487
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,958
light it doesn't enter our grow space

488
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
and we can duct that light that heat

489
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,000
wherever we need it

490
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,920
a lot of times you'll put several of

491
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,720
those lights in a chain you put a blower

492
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,120
at one end

493
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,560
you blow a carbon filter a blower uh

494
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,240
ducting and then your light chain

495
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,799
however many lights you're going to put

496
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,399
and then you do ducting right outside of

497
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,599
your grow facility right out of the room

498
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,320
right out of the window however you're

499
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,480
gonna do it

500
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,800
duck that air outside so then the air

501
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,240
goes over your lights and outside

502
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,759
that way you're cooling off the lights

503
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,360
none of that light heat is heating up

504
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,078
your grow space right

505
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,879
why not turn that blower around and suck

506
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:04,638
that cool air

507
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,799
over your lights to cool the lights even

508
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,399
more at that point i would duct the

509
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,159
i would do a complete loop i would have

510
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,759
air coming in from outside

511
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,439
going over my lights then it would do a

512
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,639
u-turn one into the room and go right

513
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
back across the room

514
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,799
go through all the other ducting every

515
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,320
over every light then it would go out

516
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,479
it would go right against the wall and

517
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,480
that duct would go right out of a hole

518
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
i use the blue foam insulation to cover

519
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,278
windows and you can drill

520
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,799
six-inch holes through that foam

521
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,240
insulation very easily and run your

522
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,759
ducting right through that so i would

523
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,600
create a continuous loop

524
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,519
that way none of that heat from your

525
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,480
lights makes it to your grow

526
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,120
and you can cool those lights rapidly by

527
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,519
pulling that

528
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,519
17 degree air over those light bulbs

529
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,000
that'll cool it very very quickly don't

530
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,399
introduce

531
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,198
that 17 degree air into your grow room

532
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,559
right away

533
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,319
then you'll start getting frost and

534
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,719
icicles and that will encourage you to

535
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,560
get

536
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
powdery mildew but if you can reverse

537
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,679
the duct and keep that loop

538
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,600
and get the air over the lights and

539
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,198
right back out that will rapidly cool

540
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,720
those grow lights

541
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,639
a lot of times it's going to get too

542
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,560
cold in your grow room

543
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,240
what's to stop you from hanging more

544
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,679
lights most of the time the thing

545
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,919
stopping us from putting up more lights

546
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,838
is heat it's winter time let's put up

547
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,439
more lights don't buy a heater don't put

548
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,120
a heater in there that is a waste

549
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,480
more light is the way to go the light

550
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,919
will create the heat for you

551
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,079
put more lights in there and warm up

552
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,360
that grow room with more whites of

553
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:21,759
course if you want to do a heater do

554
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,278
that

555
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,480
you may need a heater in the night cycle

556
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:25,679
if you don't have a way to keep it warm

557
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,000
if you don't have another room to dump

558
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,319
the heat

559
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,360
into there but instead of buying a

560
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,000
heater i almost

561
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,360
always buy another grow light something

562
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,159
else to think about is our light

563
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
schedule

564
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,559
are we running the lights at the

565
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,440
appropriate time electricity is overall

566
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,599
cheaper at night time during off-peak

567
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,440
hours your electricity is cheaper

568
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
everybody's working everybody's hustling

569
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,560
and bustling everyone's at the store at

570
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,399
the office doing stuff

571
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,758
from like eight to six in the day eight

572
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,159
in the morning to six in the evening

573
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
everybody's busy doing [ __ ] electricity

574
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,278
is much more expensive than

575
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,360
i think around eight or nine o'clock

576
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,838
your electricity price will drop

577
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,759
it will reduce a little bit let's run

578
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,240
more of our electrical components

579
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,600
during that off-peak hour then it's a

580
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
little bit cheaper to run all of your

581
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,320
equipment

582
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,079
also it's colder than when the sun goes

583
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,519
down it gets cold outside

584
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,039
let's turn on the lights while it's cold

585
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,879
outside to keep that grow room cold

586
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,480
during the coldest part of the day

587
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,919
then when the lights go off during the

588
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,440
day it's not super cold

589
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,599
outside because we got the sun helping

590
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,680
us out a little bit we can use

591
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,639
that uh cheaper lighting the cheaper

592
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,719
electricity

593
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,480
and the sun competition and the lights

594
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,278
as heat use it all together

595
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,399
to create a cheaper more efficient grow

596
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,559
environment

597
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,240
you can do that a lot of times we'll do

598
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,599
that in the summer because it's too damn

599
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,799
hot during the day to run the grow

600
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
lights because you're competing with the

601
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,758
sun your air conditioner is trying to

602
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
cool that room you got lights and the

603
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,800
sun to fight with

604
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,399
it's going to get real hot in there run

605
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,799
your lights during the night time during

606
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,399
the

607
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,240
summer also run them during the night

608
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,759
time during the winter because it gets

609
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,039
so cold in the dark time

610
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,560
and the night time that you want those

611
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,000
lights to heat up your space i hope that

612
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,039
made sense because i jumbled my words

613
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,159
trying to say that

614
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,879
it made sense to me one thing that is

615
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,720
helpful

616
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,240
these colder temperatures are going to

617
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,480
provide beautiful

618
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,000
colors for our plants if you do get that

619
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,798
grow room a little bit colder in your

620
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,640
night cycle

621
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,240
especially toward the very end of flower

622
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,439
that flush phase if you can get it a

623
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,120
little bit cold in there

624
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,798
that is going to turn your plants the

625
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,558
leaves will get purple they'll turn red

626
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,558
they'll get yellow fall colors

627
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:23,838
i really find beauty in those fall

628
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:24,558
winter colors when the plants are

629
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:26,798
finishing

630
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,480
that always comes from my winter crop my

631
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,839
some of my best photos are my winter

632
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,599
crops a lot of people say

633
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,359
that their crop around halloween is

634
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,558
always the best indoor crop that they

635
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,918
pull it's so easy

636
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,839
because we're not competing with all the

637
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,759
heat from the sun we're not getting as

638
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,359
much humidity because it's not as hot

639
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,960
this is prime opportunity for a

640
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,240
beautiful winter crop

641
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,160
uh where am i gonna go from here i'm

642
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,359
gonna quickly skim skim my notes make

643
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,400
sure i didn't skip anything because i'm

644
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,399
on a roll

645
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,240
where are we all right here we are

646
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,640
um another thing i want to talk about

647
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,000
this is not a seasonal related this is a

648
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,360
trick that i learned

649
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,880
i think i learned this one i'm gonna

650
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,959
give credit where credit is due i think

651
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,720
the very first time i ever saw this was

652
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,558
my friend colin gordon from the ethos

653
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,798
collective is who showed me this

654
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,240
uh if you are getting big giant chunky

655
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,440
buds in your grow room and this works

656
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,279
for any environment

657
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,279
uh wintertime summer time this is for

658
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,678
big chunky buds in a humid room

659
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,879
if you're getting big fat colas big fat

660
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,559
buds in your grow room

661
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,480
you get the opportunity for powdery

662
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,160
mildew or bud mold

663
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,599
uh more likely bud mold is what i should

664
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,720
have said in the middle of those big

665
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,359
buds you got a big

666
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,279
[ __ ] gallon milk jug size bud you've

667
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,639
got a bunch of miniature buds growing up

668
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,879
a stick and they're all kind of

669
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,360
gathering up the middle of that stick

670
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
uh i take i could take i would recommend

671
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,639
you take

672
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,279
popsicle sticks or tongue depressors and

673
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,200
kind of

674
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,798
peel that bud off of the stick a little

675
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,558
bit don't break it just pull it back

676
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,720
from the stick you can grab

677
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,720
one little bud on a giant cola you can

678
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,400
pull those buds off and put a popsicle

679
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,880
stick in there or a tongue depressor in

680
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
there

681
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,559
let the bud rest up against the stem

682
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,080
again and now you're going to create air

683
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,000
space between the bud

684
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,119
and the stem and the other buds on that

685
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,119
stem and you will

686
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,959
drastically reduce your opportunity to

687
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,239
get bud mold in the middle of that

688
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,360
gigantic bud

689
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
i'm going to try to explain that one

690
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,319
more time just to make sure i get it

691
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
clear you got a big cola

692
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,720
it's growing it's not really one big bud

693
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
it is multiple buds growing really well

694
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,079
together on one big stock is what you've

695
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,919
got there when you got that big cola it

696
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,599
looks like a big glory bud

697
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,960
once it gets to the grow once it gets to

698
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,639
the dispensary environment it's going to

699
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,319
get cut down into little buds that's a

700
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,360
bunch of little buds on one stick so you

701
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,359
got your big stick

702
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,959
you got a bunch of little medium sized

703
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,319
buds growing off of it

704
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,679
so you got a stick with the chunky

705
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,879
nugget growing off and a chunky nugget

706
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,360
growing off and a nugget

707
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,000
you can just pull that nugget out and

708
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,839
down a little

709
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,279
bit and slide a popsicle stick in there

710
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,119
or a tongue depressor in there

711
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,879
and let it close on there and hold the

712
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,319
stick itself and you will create

713
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,919
air space now we're just creating we're

714
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,119
putting a little gap between the other

715
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,880
buds and the stick

716
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,159
we can create some airflow in there

717
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,760
think about all the moisture that is

718
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,679
trapped in there think about all the

719
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,960
microbial activity that could develop

720
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,640
inside of that tight

721
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,240
uh space your buds are kind of spongy

722
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,400
they hold a lot of moisture there's not

723
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
a lot of airflow so let's open them up

724
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,240
make sure we got a fan in there and that

725
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,798
popsicle stick tongue depressor trick

726
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,038
may

727
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,319
prevent some of the moldy buds that i've

728
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,679
seen happening in commercial

729
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,359
environments you guys are striving for

730
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,600
those giant buds and you're getting them

731
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,439
and then at harvest time we realize [ __ ]

732
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,678
this is all moldy in the middle

733
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,600
i can tell you that i chopped down a

734
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,320
white rhino plant this was probably 10

735
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,158
years ago

736
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,519
and mike will testify to this i chopped

737
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,559
down a white rhino plant

738
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:31,599
that had a top cola the size of two

739
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,678
2-liter soda bottles the bud was

740
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,439
probably 30 inches tall i can't even

741
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,720
reach as tall as it was the entire plant

742
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,120
was just this one cola

743
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,159
and it was as big around as a two liter

744
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,239
soda bottle

745
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,080
all the way up it was huge and girthy we

746
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,279
were completely excited about that we

747
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,639
took so many pictures

748
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,558
we've never grown anything like that

749
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,320
i've never done anything like that again

750
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,158
because once we harvested it we started

751
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,319
cutting it apart and the entire middle

752
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,400
of that whole plant was moldy right up

753
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,720
the middle so all of that product went

754
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,080
into a big-ass trash can and it went out

755
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,798
to the trash it was gone it was

756
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,879
destroyed

757
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,879
that was considered waste at that point

758
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,559
the way i could have prevented that

759
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,840
was obviously a little bit more airflow

760
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,839
but how am i going to get air moving

761
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,480
inside of that big giant donkey dick of

762
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,558
a bud

763
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,319
i had to open up those buds a little bit

764
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,200
put some tongue depressors or popsicle

765
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:16,960
sticks in there

766
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,400
or something non-porous that isn't going

767
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,679
to hold moisture you can use something

768
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,280
plastic if you've got it

769
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,559
tongue depressors and popsicle sticks

770
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,359
are readily available they're very

771
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:24,720
affordable

772
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,719
you can break them in half you can get

773
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,480
two uses out of one popsicle stick

774
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,159
just spread them around your buds that

775
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,759
will really help you out i know that

776
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,280
sounds random and chaotic to a lot of

777
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,000
people but if you've got a big grow

778
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,558
that's at risk of losing product to uh

779
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,720
bud rot

780
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,558
especially outdoors and in a big grow in

781
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,120
a humid humid area

782
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,158
this will be very useful to you all

783
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,359
right i'm going to skim one more time

784
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,480
make sure i got all my notes i feel like

785
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,879
i covered everything

786
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,759
i don't want to go too quickly the water

787
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,360
is cold

788
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:55,599
exhaust your heat move the humidity um

789
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,798
don't feed the plants too cold of water

790
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,158
run the lights during the

791
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,839
night or day depending on your

792
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,320
environment add more lights to keep it

793
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,599
warm

794
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,240
lower temperatures are going to get your

795
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,798
plants colors popsicle sticks for giant

796
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,880
buds

797
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,079

798
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,520
