25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,920
you know i like to start the podcast off

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,759
by talking about what i'm smoking

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
today i've been taking dabs of melon

28
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,679
smash live batter

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,960

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
wrecker bx

31
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,079
on the package the flavor is described

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,760
as melons and fuel

33
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,200
i think i completely agree with that

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,799
when i crack open the jar

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
it is watermelony there's a hint of

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,159
strawberries coming out of there

37
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,158
then when i take a dab i am greeted with

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
that fuel flavor on my tongue

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
i really do enjoy it it's got a very

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,799
pleasant buzz on the back of the package

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
it says it contains

42
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,680

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,279
point

real name i like that a lot when people

214
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,038
tell me not to use their real name makes

215
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
it easy

216
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,159
i know who gets a shout out from this

217
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,679
one i know not to use your name

218
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,439
let's keep going it says i've been

219
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
meaning to write to you since episode

220
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,800
560 to tell you how much i enjoyed

221
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,280
hearing you and mike drop

222
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,720
stories and knowledge you two just

223
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,399
bullshitting provided so much

224
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,199
information that people like me would

225
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,239
never hear and that made 560 a great

226
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,680
episode

227
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
it thanks a lot that was a fun episode

228
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
to record we really went off the rails

229
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,280
uh we really had a good time it was just

230
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,680
two dudes hanging out i'm glad you guys

231
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,119
appreciate it it also says my incentive

232
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,038
to write was increased because i have a

233
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,800
question about something that just

234
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,399
happened to me so we've got some

235
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,199
first-hand experience inspiring

236
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,879
questions

237
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
let's not waste too much time it goes

238
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,719
like this i don't want to mention the

239
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,240
breeder or the seed bank involved very

240
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,919
classy thank you i would have edited

241
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
that out anyway but i like your approach

242
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,959
it says

243
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,560
i ordered a particular strain from a

244
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,519
seed bank which i am sure you are

245
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,560
familiar with

246
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,799
but does not carry iri genetics uh

247
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,399
it says my habit is to grow one seed out

248
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,120
to learn the plant before i grow

249
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,519
more i'd put this and an orange gasm in

250
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,439
a flower tent at the same time

251
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,198
they were two of the they were the two

252
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,439
prettiest girls in the tent

253
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,240
these plants were two and one half weeks

254
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,918
into flower

255
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,160
so i pulled them out of the tent to give

256
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,038
them a close visual inspection

257
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,759
you know just in case all right so where

258
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,159
we are is

259
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
uh this listener bought some seeds uh

260
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,960
they bought a pack of seeds from a

261
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,799
vendor that does not carry ivory

262
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,079
genetics which is just fine i encourage

263
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,439
you to grow more stuff

264
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,878
of course i want you to buy my seeds and

265
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,360
grow them but there are so many things

266
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,439
out there

267
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
don't stick with just me try more [ __ ]

268
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,560
and then also you'll see

269
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,400
where things stand uh so our friend

270
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,680
bought some seeds they also bought some

271
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,719
orange seeds

272
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,319
they grow one seed from a pack at a time

273
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
so now they've got an orgasm seed

274
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,280
growing and they've got this other seed

275
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,079
growing which we're not going to

276
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,679
name so they are how are we one two and

277
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,439
one half weeks and a flower

278
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,959
he's taken his plants out of the tent to

279
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,439
take a look just like we're supposed to

280
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,918
do and i already know how this is gonna

281
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,360
go

282
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,439
uh it says you've probably guessed by

283
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,879
now that i found male pollen sacks

284
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,839
growing alongside

285
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,000
female flowers on the plant in question

286
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,318
so the plant that is not the orange gasm

287
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,199
is showing female flowers on one plant

288
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,840
on one bud

289
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,400
and male flowers on another we've got an

290
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,598
intersex

291
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,439
plant here it is showing us two

292
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,360
different traits let's keep talking

293
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,320
about this it says the orange gasm

294
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,038
was fine so the orange gasm hasn't shown

295
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,200
you any

296
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,120
intersex or hermaphroditic traits it is

297
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
still flowering as a female

298
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,639
it says thankfully no pollen has been

299
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
released

300
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,559
um no problem that you know of don't get

301
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,199
too excited yeah those [ __ ] go

302
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,079
more quickly than we think sometimes i

303
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,839
don't want to

304
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,278
[ __ ] burst your bubble but hopefully

305
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,480
i'm really hoping you got in there early

306
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,759
enough that they go sooner than we

307
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,680
expect sometimes

308
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,159
uh it says it's tough to commit can

309
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,519
aside but that guy gal had to go yes get

310
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,399
those the [ __ ] out of there don't feel

311
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,120
bad at all

312
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,440
about committing plant caniside uh we

313
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,919
are

314
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,279
looking for uh professional athletes

315
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,199
we're looking for high level

316
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,799
uh [ __ ] olympic athletes and that one

317
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,560
was not performing it couldn't even run

318
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,799
around the track so it had to go

319
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,479
uh this is an elite club and we are very

320
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,000
selective i'm not afraid to admit that i

321
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,039
[ __ ] choose favorites in my garden

322
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,639
that's how it goes

323
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,079
uh it's okay to do that with plants we

324
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,519
can't do it with people all right let's

325
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
keep moving forward i'm [ __ ] rambly

326
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,799
today

327
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,560
uh where are we so that had to go the

328
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,639
breeder in question had online reviews

329
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,559
indicating problems with hermaphrodites

330
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,958
so i contacted the seed bank and after

331
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,958
much wrangling i got some relief

332
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,199
you're very lucky there because a lot of

333
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,399
the seed banks if you say you germinated

334
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,240
the seeds they're going to tell you that

335
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,919
those were meant as souvenirs and you

336
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,519
can't germinate them anyway so you

337
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,799
[ __ ] up by germinating them

338
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,560
and now you're [ __ ] out of luck so

339
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,000
you're lucky you got anywhere with that

340
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,838
seed bank honestly

341
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,278
uh it says however the seed bank blamed

342
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,200
me of course they did

343
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,720
of course they did i'll wait to see

344
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,160
exactly what the seller does before i

345
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,959
decide if i'm satisfied with its

346
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
response

347
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,879
needless to say i won't grow any more

348
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,320
seeds from that pack

349
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,838
most likely that company is going to

350
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,200
blow you off you did send me details

351
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,640
about where this came from that i left

352
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,920
out of the show

353
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,199
they are not going to reply to you

354
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,639
they're not going to do [ __ ] for you and

355
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,519
my assumption in my experience they're

356
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,879
going to tell you that it was all your

357
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
fault to have a good day

358
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,759
they may give you a coupon or something

359
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,919
for more seeds but i don't think you're

360
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,838
going to be satisfied with the fix here

361
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,240
that's why i recommend seeds herenow.com

362
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,240
100 satisfaction guarantee

363
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,759
if seeds go wrong that you buy at seeds

364
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,200
here now you send them a message you say

365
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,720
hey these seeds didn't work

366
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
they will replace them then they will

367
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,759
let me know that they had to replace

368
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,239
them and then i replaced them so

369
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,679
the only person i i cover my mistakes if

370
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,440
your seeds don't work i cover them to

371
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,719
the seed bank the seed bank covers you

372
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,160
we want to make sure everybody's happy

373
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
that's how customer service should work

374
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,600
so

375
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,278
let me know if you ever got a problem

376
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,278
with ire genetics seeds send me an email

377
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,240

about it we'll take care of you

381
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,879
um so i really think your [ __ ] out of

382
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,600
luck with those seeds that you got but

383
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,919
luckily

384
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
you were a guy that once runs one seed

385
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,919
at a time a lot of people run the whole

386
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,440
pack

387
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,838
that could have been a 10 pack or a 12

388
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,600
pack of seeds imagine if you run 12 of

389
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,760
them and found 12 herms

390
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,519
you would have had 12 times the soil

391
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,120
water nutrient space

392
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,799
it would have been compounded by 12 so

393
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,078
i'm kind of glad you're a guy that runs

394
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,399
one at a time

395
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,519
and if you got one intersex plant out of

396
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,360
that batch

397
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,799
so far they are a hundred percent

398
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,079
problematic seeds i can only imagine

399
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,759
what's going to come from the other 10

400
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,278
or 12 or maybe six

401
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,439
uh if there were femmes that company

402
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,720
sells packs of six femmes i think so

403
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
uh you would have had five more

404
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
problematic plants on your hands i need

405
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,240
to get myself back on track or this

406
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
podcast is going to end up being like 44

407
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,879
days long

408
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
let's get focused here it says so here

409
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,838
is my question these pollen sacks

410
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,360
uh were what i would call genetic herms

411
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,480
as opposed to stress

412
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,839
herms so uh he's calling them genetic

413
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,519
hermaphrodites and not

414
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,079
stress hermaphrodites in my mind those

415
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,839
labels indicate that uh

416
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,599
this is kind of a weird boundary to

417
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,920
cross here kind of a fine line to dance

418
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,879
on

419
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,360
but he's saying that he assumes some

420
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,240
plants

421
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,079
are more genetically prone and poorly

422
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,799
selected to be herms and some are just

423
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,799
triggered

424
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,000
that trait was lying in that plant and

425
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,519
it would have been brought out

426
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,039
but i'm going to get to that part let me

427
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,200
just keep talking it says am i correct

428
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,879
that if pollen sacs develop on a plant

429
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,040
side by side with female flowers that

430
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,759
the trait is within the genetics of the

431
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,078
strain and not a result of stress

432
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,919
while i did have less than a week of

433
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,958
slightly higher temp temperatures during

434
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,479
a short heat wave

435
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,719
conditions in the tent were pretty

436
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,959
normal can you explain the process

437
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,320
of hermaphroditism and cannabis

438
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,479
including the difference

439
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,440
between what causes male female parts on

440
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
the same node

441
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
and what causes another to or anthers to

442
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,519
sprout from

443
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,278
flowers thanks for the benefit of your

444
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,600
expertise

445
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,559
i don't know that i am an expert in the

446
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,560
category of

447
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,239
hermaphroditism or intersex plants um

448
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,679
kinda if i see that i get rid of the

449
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,560
plants but i do

450
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,000
understand what you are asking sometimes

451
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,719
you will see a plant

452
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,919
later in flower start throwing uh we

453
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,600
call them nanners they're just

454
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,759
single male flowers that pop up in the

455
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,639
middle of a bud

456
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,639
i think those are more from stressing a

457
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,039
plant those are more from problems i

458
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,879
think

459
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,120
when your plant produced these male

460
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,519
flowers early into flower like that

461
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,440
that that is a hermaphroditic plant

462
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,039
those are probably problematic seeds

463
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,120
that were poorly selected

464
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,480
i did reply to our friend here he signed

465
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,320
it with uh

466
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,759
uh this is from used to be cool there we

467
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,120
go he did sign it from used to be cool

468
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,319
he signed it with us to be cool if i

469
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,360
just showed your name on the screen i

470
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
will block that out because i held up

471
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,480
your email

472
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,278
but um so i did reply to used to be cool

473
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,759
and i said

474
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,919
hey i think both of those examples are

475
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,600
predetermined traits in the plant a lot

476
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,078
like color and structure

477
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,000
so that hermaphroditism is a trait

478
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,679
within that plant it is a trait

479
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,679
just like the smell of the plant just

480
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,759
like the growth uh maybe it's really

481
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,919
good with pm maybe it's not also

482
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,000
maybe it's got intersex that's just an

483
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,559
alien which this plant carries

484
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,519
so i said we provide the environmental

485
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,119
situation

486
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,679
to trigger that expression so that plant

487
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,360
held that intersex trait we had to give

488
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,879
it the environment to bring that

489
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,320
intersex trait out

490
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,240
just like a lot of times you can make

491
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
some plants turn cold or turn purple if

492
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,320
you get them cold that's a trait we can

493
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,639
bring out through environmental factors

494
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,320
density is a lot determined by

495
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,919
environmental factors we can get airy

496
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
buds or we can get dense buds from the

497
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,719
same plant

498
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,959
based on the environment so we are

499
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,519
giving it the situation to express

500
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,879
different things if i put you i'm trying

501
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,320
to think of different situations i can

502
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,078
put you in if i put you

503
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,839
uh near a bunch of junk food all the

504
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,198
time and make you watch crap tv

505
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,360
you're gonna turn into a junk food

506
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,039
eating crap-minded person if i give you

507
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
health food and healthy things to do all

508
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,958
day

509
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,480
you'll become a healthy person who's

510
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,958
physically fit with a strong healthy

511
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
mind

512
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,879
that is a product of your environment

513
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,759
that is how you express your environment

514
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,879
plants do the same thing i'm trying to

515
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,799
stay on track and also give good

516
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,120
examples uh so these plants

517
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,719
were given the environment to show

518
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,639
hermaphroditism

519
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,759
um and i'm getting off track of what i

520
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,198
wrote here let me keep going with what i

521
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,879
wrote i said a breeder should be testing

522
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,679
his seeds before releasing them

523
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,919
i think what you got was poor breeding

524
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,679
and

525
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,120
untested seeds that were prone to

526
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,239
intersex traits

527
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,039
poorly selected parent stock for femmes

528
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
will make hermaphroditic offspring

529
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,639
that's not the word i wrote here but

530
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,399
it says plants that flip from major

531
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,240
stress are more common

532
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,759
because cannabis wants to survive and

533
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
will reproduce

534
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,600
so if you leave most cannabis plants

535
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,359
growing for too long they will find a

536
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
way to produ reproduce

537
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,759
they will start throwing off very few

538
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,440
hermaphroditic male flowers or male

539
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,879
flowers not even hermaphroditic flowers

540
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
they will be male flowers they'll start

541
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,159
throwing those off

542
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,679
the idea of this plant is nobody's gonna

543
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,600
pick me no one's gonna pollinate me i'll

544
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,000
[ __ ] self-pollinate myself so i can

545
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,120
survive that's cannabis whole goal it

546
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,879
wants to make seeds

547
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,159
so it can grow again next year so it can

548
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,399
make seeds and grow again

549
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,919
next year so i'm going to try to get

550
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,399
myself back where i was here

551
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,198
uh the plants want to survive so that

552
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,720
hint of

553
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:10,879
hermaphroditism is in a lot of plants

554
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,959
breeders should be selecting plants more

555
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,679
carefully to where we don't have

556
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,799
such likelihood for hermaphroditism in

557
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,638
the offspring

558
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,000
i think what this guy got what used to

559
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,120
be cool got was just

560
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,639
poorly bred untested uh untried and true

561
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,759
genetics these genetics should have been

562
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,519
test grown

563
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,039
if they showed hermaphroditism if they

564
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,560
showed intersex traits two and a half

565
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,879
weeks into flower like that

566
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,958
the breeder should have seen that one of

567
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,439
yours did it a hundred percent of yours

568
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,359
did it

569
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,560
that means a few of his had to have done

570
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,278
it and he should have seen that and he

571
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,958
should have said

572
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,799
these are [ __ ] i should not sell these

573
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,319
to anybody i need to grow these myself

574
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,519
and find some gems or give them to my

575
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
friends and warn them that these are

576
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,000
[ __ ]

577
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,000
but they should not have gone to market

578
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,679
no vendor no retailer should have ever

579
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,919
gotten their hands on these that was

580
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,799
poor practices bad customer service bad

581
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,599
selection

582
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,719
bad ethics bad breeding uh that's [ __ ]

583
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,519
up is what that is

584
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,320
um so that should have been removed from

585
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,160
the gene pool

586
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,439
now this guy's passing on hermaphroditic

587
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,038
seeds a bunch of people are going to buy

588
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,000
these seeds they're going to spend money

589
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,919
they're going to be pissed off i'm

590
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,519
getting way off track it says um

591
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,520
balls and pistols on the same branch

592
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,160
show obvious intersex traits a few

593
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,918
nanners

594
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,519
and a mostly looking female is more

595
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,720
likely a grower issue

596
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,318
so if you're causing the plants or

597
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,000
hermaphrodite and it's just spitting out

598
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,159
a couple of male flowers

599
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,759
that is probably a light leak some sort

600
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,160
of stress but if it's showing

601
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,119
straight up balls and female flowers on

602
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
the same plant

603
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,798
that was a poorly selected breeding

604
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,160
project it should have been eliminated

605
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,319
it should have been scrapped

606
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
uh then i wrapped my message up with i'm

607
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,918
high as [ __ ] so i hope this

608
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,120
makes sense yeah sometimes you guys i'm

609
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,679
answering messages at three in the

610
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,119
morning

611
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,798
and i'm high as [ __ ] um so mainly that

612
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,239
should have been found in test batches

613
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:50,798
and you should not have been sold those

614
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,839
seeds

615
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:53,839
i don't think any of that

616
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,759
hermaphroditism was your fault

617
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,519
uh since you've got another plant in

618
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,558
there the orange gasm didn't show you

619
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,480
any problems

620
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,918
that's an indicator that that was a

621
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,720
problem with the genetics

622
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,000
and not your fault all right i hope i

623
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,679
rambled right through your question i

624
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,519
hope i gave you some useful advice

625
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,038
i do appreciate all of the interaction

626
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,679
with you brother and i look forward to

627
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,879
hearing

628
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,640
your reply to my reply all right i want

629
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,160
to keep moving i do have a screenshot in

630
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,320
my phone from another message

631
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,759
somebody sent me a message on i don't

632
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,759
remember if this came from youtube or

633
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,440
cano buzz but my phone will tell me

634
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,279
if i quit stumbling and get right to it

635
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
all right this one is from cana buzz

636
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,160
and it says hey ross to jeff i just

637
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,840
discovered your show via the dgc

638
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,679
shout out to my friends at the dude grow

639
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,359
show our new friend found us through the

640
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,880
dude grow show so thank you for finding

641
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,639
me from the dgc

642
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,720
it says you mentioned you are limited to

643
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,679
a low plant count at home yes i'm in

644
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,480
colorado

645
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,880
our plant count here uh it is a six

646
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,839
plant per person cap for recreational

647
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,760
cannabis

648
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,839
however i do have a medical cannabis

649
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,200
card which allows me six more plants so

650
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,119
i'm now allowed 12

651
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,720
plants in my personal grow that's what

652
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,759
i'm allowed to have because of the state

653
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,240
of colorado

654
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,919
so that does limit me very low to

655
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,038
breeding i've got 12 plants i'm allowed

656
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,799
to work with

657
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,480
this goes on and says could you talk

658
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,440
about the logistics of breeding at home

659
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,279
with a low

660
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,679
plant count yes that is something i

661
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,160
could definitely elaborate on

662
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,840
um the difference between breeding in a

663
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,120
bigger facility and breeding in a

664
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,759
smaller facility

665
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,239
is definitely smaller batches smaller

666
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:27,119
scales which means more focus

667
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,240
um i'm only allowed 12 plants so if you

668
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,558
really want to think about it

669
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,400
how many mom plants do i keep and then

670
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,240
how many plants do i put in the veg room

671
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,600
and then i need a male plant also or how

672
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,079
many plants do i put into the flower

673
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,240
room

674
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,279
so i've got mother plants veg plants

675
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,519
flower plants

676
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,440
and a male plant and hopefully backups

677
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,679
or clones of whatever i'm working with

678
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,360
so i've got to be really really

679
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,720
selective of what i'm using

680
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,399
and what i'm going to breed with and

681
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,679
what makes and doesn't make the cut to

682
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
stay in my stable

683
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,600
so if you want to breed on a very small

684
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,519
scale because of plant counts you need

685
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,879
to focus on your goals you can't have

686
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,240
any plants that aren't

687
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,320
winners aren't champions aren't

688
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,558
potential breeders you've got to have

689
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,519
nothing but winners in there all right

690
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,158
so let's use my

691
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,519
12 plant state legal count to do a

692
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,880
little breeding project

693
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,798
we've got a couple of options when it

694
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,559
comes to breeding do you want to breed

695
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,240
one plant to one plant do you want to

696
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:17,279
breed one male plant to a bunch of

697
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,279
female plants

698
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,480
do you want to breed a reversed female

699
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,240
to other females

700
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,159
what is your ultimate goal that's going

701
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,000
to be a lot of the decision making

702
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,200
when it comes to logistics of breeding

703
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,679
at home

704
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,319
since i run a commercial seed breeding

705
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,320
company

706
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,678
i like to make multiple strains at one

707
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,240
time so i usually put

708
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,159
king solomon my popular male in the room

709
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,079
with several females so that he can hit

710
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,280
the strawberry fields the platinum tangy

711
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,119
the blueberry cookies

712
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,720
and then we can make uh what do we make

713
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,079
there we make sun kiss we make

714
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,600
strawberry fields and we make blue

715
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,279
raspberry truffle out of those

716
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,199
i'll put the morning dew or the grateful

717
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,038
dog in there so we can make morning dew

718
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,120
i'll put an arise female in there so we

719
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,558
can make a rise f2 seeds

720
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,399
then maybe when you're not looking i'll

721
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,918
sneak something brand new in there so i

722
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,679
can make a brand new cross

723
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,919
so i've got a bunch of the old trusty

724
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,519
reliable stuff to restock the stores

725
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,520
then also i've got a brand new thing to

726
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,879
send out to my testers i can build more

727
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,079
hype keep stuff going

728
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,440
while i'm doing productivity so since i

729
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,519
make commercial production

730
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,360
i'm putting a male in there with five or

731
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,679
six tried and trued females

732
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,879
that boy hits those girls then i make a

733
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,200
batch of five or six

734
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,400
different crosses then i harvest those

735
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,558
they're ready to go

736
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,480
the thing i have to think about is i've

737
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,399
got a certain amount of mother plants

738
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,558
i know which genetics i want to keep so

739
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,159
i select a few of those

740
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,319
those plants are now eating up part of

741
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,080
my plant count so king solomon is always

742
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,798
around he's always eating a part of my

743
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,359
plant count

744
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,440
strawberry fields uh what is the other

745
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,959
one platinum tangy blueberry cookies

746
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,480
those are eating up part of my plant

747
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,319
count so those are there

748
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,679
those are going to get cloned off of or

749
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,399
they're going to get dragged into the

750
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,798
flower room

751
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,720
with the male plant now my issue is i

752
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,158
need to keep those plants around because

753
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
i want to breed with them again in the

754
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
future

755
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,799
so now i've got to take a clone of them

756
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,679
those clones are starting to eat up my

757
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,679
plant count

758
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,280
so what i've got to do is carefully

759
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,000
think about how many mother plants i'm

760
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,359
going to keep

761
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,119
how many plants i'm going to throw into

762
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,038
the breeding room then how i'm going to

763
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,239
keep clones of those to keep them for

764
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,240
preservation

765
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,519
it is a really nice balance and a really

766
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,519
nice juggle

767
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,038
luckily i do have other places where i

768
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,079
can store mother plants i've got friends

769
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,919
that i can rely on

770
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,279
they will keep genetics for me they've

771
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,559
just got a mother plant of certain

772
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,038
things where if i want to breed with

773
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:26,480
that

774
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,319
i just call them up and i say hey i'm

775
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,000
going to need six clones of this plant

776
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,639
in this many days can you get them going

777
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
for me

778
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,919
and they take 12 clones and i go pick my

779
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,279
favorite six and they get to run the

780
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,159
other six and that's how we

781
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,119
make sure that genetics stay alive i've

782
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,799
got some

783
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,239
really trustworthy friends who have got

784
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:43,918
some really good genetics

785
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,359
[ __ ] stashed away for me or i

786
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,640
wouldn't be able to do a lot of the

787
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,359
projects that i do

788
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,880
so you've got to be able to keep your

789
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,240
mother plants you've got to have veg

790
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
plants that will eventually become

791
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,319
flower plants and you need clones

792
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,759
to keep preservation of your stuff

793
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,319
another thing you can do

794
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,879
is you can re-veg if you don't have the

795
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,879
numbers

796
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,480
you can re-veg this is going to sound

797
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,320
crazy to a new breeder but this is

798
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,159
something that is completely possible

799
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,759
i've done it i can show you the seeds i

800
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,080
can show you the mother plant

801
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,119
i've got proof so here's what i've done

802
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,079
i took a plant

803
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,959
i put it into flour for 18 days and i

804
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,639
pollinated it

805
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,319
i let that [ __ ] sit for about five

806
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,559
days with pollen in it

807
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,439
then i put it back into the veg room

808
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,079
under 18

809
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,640
6. what i know right my plant is

810
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,639
pregnant

811
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,840
and now i'm putting it back in veg

812
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
slowly over time

813
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,359
that plant went back into a vegetative

814
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,359
stage also

815
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,719
the seeds inside of that plant kept

816
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,158
maturing because

817
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,079
that plant didn't care if it was in

818
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,240
flour or if it was in veg it was already

819
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,119
pregnant and it was going to make seeds

820
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,839
so my plant is in the veg room making

821
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,439
seeds

822
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,439
about six or seven weeks into that

823
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,558
process i harvested all of the seeds

824
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,038
from that plant

825
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,720
as i did so i left a bunch of those new

826
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,079
shoots that grew out because the plant

827
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,679
was fully re-veging

828
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,519
so i just left those shoots that were

829
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,840
growing out and that plant is now

830
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,960
completely in reveg and has given me

831
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,119
fresh clones so i put a plant into flour

832
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
i pollinated it i moved that plant back

833
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,319
into a veg room

834
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,480
i harvested that plant for all of its

835
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,079
seeds that plant is now a mother plant

836
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,159
that has been giving me clones

837
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,199
which are now back into the flower room

838
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,600
being pollinated

839
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,319
all over again i was able to pollinate

840
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,399
my plant

841
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:25,038
harvest seeds from it preserve the

842
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,679
genetics and create more clones from the

843
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:27,519
same

844
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,880
plant and once this plant grows out big

845
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,200
enough i will put it back

846
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,039
in the flower room and pollinate it one

847
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,798
more time because i've got a clone from

848
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,319
it and i've got a keeper and i just want

849
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:37,918
to say that i've seeded that plant

850
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,119
multiple times and pulled harvest from

851
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,919
it because it's fun

852
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,119
so that is a way to preserve your

853
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,600
genetics the main

854
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,599
struggle i have is preserving my

855
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,959
genetics i want to keep all of my plants

856
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,480
here they're like my babies they're my

857
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,200
kids they're honestly my business and my

858
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,558
livelihood

859
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,080
i want to keep my eyes on them but i

860
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,639
can't do it because i have to let my

861
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,639
other

862
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,559
trustworthy friends keep my veg plants

863
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,640
around for me my mother plants around

864
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,918
because i don't have the legal space

865
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,038
they don't want to grow they don't have

866
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,640
a use for it so i

867
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,640
help them out in certain ways and they

868
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,278
help me out by keeping my plants around

869
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,120
so

870
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,400
um that is one way for preservation

871
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,918
that's another way to do it let me get

872
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,440
myself on track here

873
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,559
one thing that low numbers really helps

874
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,640
is with focus

875
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,158
without low if i were unlimited my

876
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,000
breeding would be crazy i wouldn't be

877
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,799
focused i like the tight focus that it

878
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,798
gives me

879
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,879
i'm only allowed so many plants i can't

880
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:27,679
go too far so it keeps me really focused

881
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,720
on having

882
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,400
nothing but elite winners in my lineup

883
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,319
the problem is i have a hard time

884
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,320
testing because now i'm limited to so

885
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,439
many plants so if i keep six moms i can

886
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,720
run six seeds

887
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,720
so i've got to find the boys and the

888
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,038
girls out of those and call those

889
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,759
oh that's a struggle now let's talk a

890
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,519
little bit about

891
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,200
pheno hunting because if you're breeding

892
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,519
you're going to be pheno hunting to find

893
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,798
the keepers from your crosses

894
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,960
a lot of people like to do large

895
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,038
phenohunts but when you're minimized by

896
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,000
legal plant counts you can only run 12

897
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:57,919
at a time

898
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,599
what's to stop you from running 10 right

899
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,679
now picking the best

900
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,759
and then running 9 right next to it next

901
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,320
time and pick the best out of that batch

902
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,400
if it's

903
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,558
the one from before or a new one just

904
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,038
keep picking the best one every time

905
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,759
run 10 seeds find the alpha [ __ ]

906
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,158
female

907
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,119
run 10 more run nine more seeds and that

908
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,039
one next to it

909
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,798
and compare that one to all of them find

910
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:19,839
the best one out of it do it until you

911
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:21,599
are satisfied

912
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,000
and you know that you have got the gem

913
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,000
the female plant that you want

914
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,839
do that for your male plant also you

915
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,278
don't have to run large batches

916
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,798
i said batches i don't know why i said

917
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,480
it that way but you don't have to run

918
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,319
large batches in populations

919
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,519
to final hunt if you're limited by

920
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,918
numbers you can do

921
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,119
if you do 10 10 seed phenohunts you've

922
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,480
ran 100 seeds

923
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,798
it's going to take you a little bit more

924
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,440
time it's going to take but in that more

925
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:44,879
time

926
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,558
you're only paying attention to 10

927
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,000
plants at a time you can really focus

928
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:48,960
and pay attention to each one like i

929
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,880
said a moment ago

930
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,079
unlimited numbers makes it hard to pay

931
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,760
attention to everything

932
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:54,960
like if you've got a hundred kids

933
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,400
running around how do you remember all

934
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,840
hundred of their names if you got ten

935
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,960
kids you can remember all ten of their

936
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,558
names hopefully because i feel like i

937
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,759
need a [ __ ] dab mid show but i'm not

938
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,038
gonna press pause and take a dab we're

939
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,158
just gonna keep going

940
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:08,240
um so you have got to manage how you

941
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,080
keep your genetics you've got to focus

942
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,519
in something that will be really nice if

943
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,038
you're trapped in a small grow is you

944
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,319
won't get super huge with all of your

945
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,558
ideas and creations

946
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,720
you may be able to focus in and make

947
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,398
further filial generations instead of

948
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,240
just making new crosses

949
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,558
make a batch of seeds keep the male and

950
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,480
female around use the rest of your count

951
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,398
to plant however many seeds you've got

952
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,000
left if you take a male plant and a

953
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,759
female plant cross those make

954
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,359
seeds whatever your plant count is

955
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,720
you've got two off your count now

956
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,798
fill the rest of that count up with

957
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,519
seeds that you just made grow those

958
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,359
seeds out

959
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,599
if you want to breed again find the best

960
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,199
male and the best female and keep those

961
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,798
now maybe a time to decide if you want

962
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,240
the original male and female around or

963
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,240
if it's time to get rid of them

964
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,519
keep that new male and that new female

965
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,599
breed those together

966
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,759
now you've got the f2s now you've got

967
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,278
f2s to play with you can [ __ ] find

968
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,720
the male and female out of there

969
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,319
and keep going and keep getting rid of

970
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,480
the old parents as you go

971
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,519
or you can add new [ __ ] to the mix as

972
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,919
long as you keep

973
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,918
preservation of your old genetics in a

974
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,120
clone form or give them to your buddy or

975
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,360
learn how to reveg

976
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,639
you can continue your breeding projects

977
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,759
all right so i did say that i was going

978
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,038
to talk about my 12

979
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,798
plant breeding program and i keep

980
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,319
getting sidetracked let's focus in a

981
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,398
little bit on my 12

982
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,558
plant breeding project i'm allowed to

983
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:21,439
have six plants in flower and six plants

984
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,759
in veg

985
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,278
so i try to get six plants that i know

986
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,558
i'm going to breed with from my friends

987
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,798
that house my genetics

988
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,879
i put those into the flower room and i

989
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,200
get them going i put the mail in there

990
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,120
about 10 to 14 days before the girls i

991
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,759
get him started i move him way over to

992
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,918
the corner

993
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,960
then i put the five females in there and

994
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,799
i get them going

995
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,720
and then when it's pollen time i shake

996
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,079
that dude and i cut him down so now i've

997
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,919
got five in one room

998
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,599
that leaves me seven other plants to

999
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,600
play with i've got six

1000
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,038
in the veg room already vegging so

1001
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,759
they're about 30 days behind

1002
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,240
my flower room so that every [ __ ] 60

1003
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,000
days

1004
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
i get to clean up the flower room spray

1005
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,679
it down rebuild a little bit of stuff

1006
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,038
put in new filters put in new [ __ ] and

1007
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,440
drag new plants in there

1008
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,398
i never miss a day if i'm on track if

1009
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,159
i'm on cycle

1010
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,599
if things win according to plan

1011
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,278
sometimes plants take a little bit

1012
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,480
longer for the plants to harden up so if

1013
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:11,839
i've got a new cross that i've been

1014
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,000
playing with i may have to wait a couple

1015
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,000
of weeks for that one plant to finish up

1016
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,839
before i could put new plants back into

1017
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,599
the flower room but generally

1018
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,199
i've got half of the room filled with

1019
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,839
plants that are pollinated and getting

1020
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,519
finished

1021
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,199
and then i've got a veg room that is

1022
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,480
filled with the other half of my plant

1023
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,000
count that are vegging out getting

1024
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,440
popped and twisted and

1025
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,278
cleaned up so that when it is flower

1026
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
time they are nice and ready as soon as

1027
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:34,159
i harvest i clean up make sure all the

1028
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,399
pollen is out of the room

1029
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,000
put more plants in there and then we get

1030
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:38,959
more veg plants and we start growing

1031
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,038
them up about

1032
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,159
14 30 days into that depending on what

1033
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,319
i'm gonna grow

1034
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,919
uh the main thing is just always have a

1035
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:46,639
plan always know where the next plants

1036
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,559
are coming from

1037
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,840
always have some clones prepared if i

1038
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,519
wasn't blessed enough to have some

1039
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,480
friends helping me out i would probably

1040
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,440
have to reduce

1041
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,839
my plants to four plants in the bedroom

1042
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,840
four

1043
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,038
in the mother room and four in flower

1044
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,359
which would be my 12

1045
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,038
plant count so i would have dedicated

1046
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,599
mother plants i'd have three females and

1047
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:05,599
a male

1048
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,199
and i would take a clone off of those

1049
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,719
those would go into the veg room

1050
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,480
then they would go into the flower room

1051
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,880
and i would always have four moms

1052
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,679
four veggies and four flowers and how i

1053
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,360
would work that

1054
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,200
so i'd have to be really strategic with

1055
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,158
that that means that i would have one

1056
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,880
boy plant

1057
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,039
and three female plants to work with or

1058
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,640
four females and i could just

1059
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,240
take turns just reversing them and

1060
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,679
pollinating them however many

1061
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,679
combinations that would give me is that

1062
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,278
16 or is that 32 or is it 64

1063
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,038
i don't know dude but there's some math

1064
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:36,960
to be involved in there it's 4 times 4

1065
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:39,440
times four it's four times the amount of

1066
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,960
opportunities you've got so that's a lot

1067
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,919
of four times fours

1068
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,759
we are way off track today all right so

1069
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,278
since i am a commercial breeder and i'm

1070
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,319
breeding for multiple strains that is

1071
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,839
how i would do it

1072
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,278
if you were a personal breeder and

1073
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:52,079
you're just trying to breed for one

1074
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:53,759
project

1075
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,158
i would recommend having a male and

1076
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,079
maybe one or two females to work with

1077
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,320
instead of making a bunch of new crosses

1078
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,480
work on furthering that line make that

1079
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:05,038
filial generation all the way to like f5

1080
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,120
or f6 where you can dial in the exact

1081
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,960
traits that you want another fun thing

1082
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,278
to do is work two lines work one line

1083
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,679
for

1084
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,839
smell work one line for potency work

1085
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,360
them both to about four or five and then

1086
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,959
breed those together and then you get

1087
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,519
the potency and flavor you were looking

1088
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,840
for

1089
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,839
that's a really fun way to do it take

1090
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,879
the a line and the b line of two of the

1091
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,558
same crosses

1092
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,000
work them for different traits and then

1093
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,359
breed those together in the end

1094
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,880
that's something a lot of people are

1095
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,240
overlooking and forgetting about that's

1096
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,720
when breeding gets really fun

1097
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,319
so i've been rambling for a long time i

1098
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,640
hope i answered your question about

1099
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,519
small-scale breeding at home mainly

1100
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,120
focus on

1101
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,798
keeping the genetics you you want to

1102
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,639
breed that [ __ ] again so have the

1103
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,960
genetics then leave yourself some room

1104
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,038
for veg plants and flowering plants

1105
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,399
and then also you may need to eliminate

1106
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,000
plants in the future so that you can

1107
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,599
sprout some of the seeds

1108
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,599
that you have produced it's always a

1109
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,319
challenge testing your new stuff because

1110
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,000
we just want to

1111
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,678
sprout a hundred of them and that's when

1112
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,880
we start getting in trouble so

1113
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,559
i hope i answered your question if

1114
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,760
