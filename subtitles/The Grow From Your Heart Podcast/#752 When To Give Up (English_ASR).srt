58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,120
where do we go from there the greenhouse

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,200
if you've been following along you know

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,959
that i'm doing a breeding project in a

61
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,280
greenhouse i was at the greenhouse today

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,719
and guess what everything looks good not

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,239
a lot to report things are growing

64
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,759
things are in veg they're getting big

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,000
they're growing quickly

66
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,159
i'm always amazed at the outdoor growth

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,080
i'm not there every single day so when i

68
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,759
do go there it looks like they've grown

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
astronomically since the last time i was

70
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,679
there they grow so fast outdoors

71
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,840
compared to the indoors double or triple

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,959
as fast outdoors is what i think but

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
they're looking good they're going

74
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,759
strong not a lot to report but

75
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,000
everything looks good in the greenhouse

76
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,518

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,919
jump into the email portion of this

119
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,758
podcast i've got a bunch of emails

120
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,000
stacked up here on the table this one

121
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,960
comes from our friend mark this question

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,120
is a recap uh in a previous episode

123
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,359
somebody did ask me if i think that the

124
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
male plants or the female plants know

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,560
about each other in the other rooms they

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
asked if i notice a difference in the

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,000
female plants if i have a male in the

128
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
other room or if i notice a difference

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,079
in the male plants if i have a female in

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
the other room i said i've noticed

131
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,680
visible differences but i didn't have

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,160
any real scientific background our

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,918
friend mark updated me he said i have an

134
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,240
update thank you for the update bro it

135
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,959
says i watched a documentary called the

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,280
magic plant and it said the terpenes

137
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,198
come from the sun and they are the sex

138
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,679
hormones for the plant so it sounds

139
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,800
plausible i guess anyway take care and

140
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,720
thank you for everything you do

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,879
those terpenes do have a lot of purposes

142
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,960
the chirps put off a lot of aromas think

143
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,759
about when you smell food or when you

144
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,079
smell uh candy or when you smell flowers

145
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,240
or when you smell a pretty lady or maybe

146
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,240
you smell a pretty dude you go that

147
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,759
smells nice i want some of that maybe

148
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,280
the cannabis plants are doing the same

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,680
thing to each other maybe that lady

150
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,359
plant is over there going laminene

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
limonene and that male plant's going i

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,319
need some limonene

153
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,519
we don't know exactly what they're

154
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,360
saying because we can't speak their

155
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,599
plant language but it sounds like you're

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,120
onto something uh maybe those terps act

157
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
like pheromones maybe the plants have

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
pheromones that we haven't that i

159
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,039
haven't learned about yet but it does

160
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,560
make good sense to me those terps are

161
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,560
doing a lot to me they make me want to

162
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,800
smoke it so maybe they're making the

163
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
plants want to meet with each other and

164
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,400
i can smell the terps in the other room

165
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,079

i love creating listener generated

173
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,319
content that's what i'm trying to say i

174
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,439
am pre-reading this next message while

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,120
i'm talking

176
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,680
all right this next message comes from a

177
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,000
good friend and a patreon supporter big

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,240
shout out to my friend girls grow too

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,360
this message goes a little bit like this

180
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,918
it says when is it too late to save a

181
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
plant that is a very very good question

182
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,680
when is it too late to save a plan when

183
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,280
do you give up when do you try to fix it

184
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,879
what is that boundary where is that

185
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,638
borderline where you say [ __ ] it and

186
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,120
throw in the towel how hard do you

187
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,120
actually try on a plant and also is it

188
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,478
one plant is it several plants that kind

189
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,399
of makes a big difference here but

190
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,639
there's more to the message it says if

191
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,279
the plant is very sick is there a way a

192
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,879
product etc that would save it let's

193
00:06:53,279 --> 00:07:00,638
just say newt lockout or over hot or

194
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,800
stunted growth okay um

195
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,478
it kind of depends on how bad the plant

196
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,280
is first of all

197
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,879
it kind of depends on how bad i need the

198
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,318
plant honestly

199
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,319
um it depends on how far along the plant

200
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
is honestly depends on is it the

201
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,120
personal growth or the commercial grow

202
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,519
is it life or death or is it a breeding

203
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,840
project that's kind of just for fun

204
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,240
i've got the honor the privilege the

205
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,839
blessing to be able to if i'm growing a

206
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
crop and i'm not happy with the way it

207
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,159
looks i can scrap it and it's not going

208
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,319
to ruin me financially i talked in a

209
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,319
previous episode about a commercial grow

210
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,720
if they were to scrap one grow

211
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,720
too far in then that could ruin them

212
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
that could ruin the commercial grow

213
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
which would fire everybody in that

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,759
facility i'm just recapping that fire a

215
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,079
lot of people so

216
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,240
in a personal grow i've got maybe maybe

217
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,240
hypothetically somebody's got one light

218
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,000
and that's just gonna be maybe a pound

219
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,000
of herb maybe two pounds maybe it's just

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,680
a few ounces that's when i start making

221
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,918
decisions like do i really need this

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,759
crop or do i really need this crop or

223
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,598
would it be less of a headache just to

224
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,400
cut this [ __ ] down and start over again

225
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,639
so there are a lot of determining

226
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,439
factors in my

227
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,759
strategies here in a commercial grow

228
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,680
we don't i don't cut enough clones and

229
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,080
have enough plants to have enough of a

230
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,240
backup strategy i'm on a tight schedule

231
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,719
i'm on a tight plant count so i'm going

232
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,319
to do a lot to try to save every single

233
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,680
plant that i can in a commercial

234
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,800
environment also in a commercial grow

235
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,120
my panic button is much shorter my panic

236
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,719
fuse is much shorter than it would be in

237
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,879
a private grow in my home grow like i

238
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,399
said i can lose a personal crop you guys

239
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,240
might not get some seeds mike might not

240
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,839
get some weed for a couple of weeks but

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,440
we could lose a personal crop nobody's

242
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,959
gonna go bankrupt nobody's gonna have to

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,240
file any paperwork no one needs to look

244
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,559
for a new job

245
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,320
if i do kill a crop at this rate i may

246
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,679
need to look for a new job by then but

247
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,760
nobody's gonna get fired nothing too

248
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,639
crazy is gonna go wrong in a commercial

249
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,799
grow

250
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,958
i can't let it get that bad before i

251
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,120
start taking drastic measures to correct

252
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,799
things luckily in a commercial grow i've

253
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,879
got all the technology i've got all the

254
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,359
meters i got anything i can imagine to

255
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,879
help me figure out what is going on also

256
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,399
i've got a really good network of

257
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,799
friends people think i'm like the wizard

258
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,480
of oz of growing i often times when you

259
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,240
guys ask me grow questions i've just got

260
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,039
a team of friends that i know that i can

261
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,879
say hey bro why this or why this i'm

262
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,559
willing to admit that i am not the light

263
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,240
guy i don't know anything about grow

264
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,639
lights when it comes to

265
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,200
lumens and frequencies and all that

266
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,879
stuff i my brain simply does not care i

267
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,200
would love to learn about lights my

268
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,480
brain and my add does not want to learn

269
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,800
about lights when it comes to outdoor

270
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,039
growing i simply don't do a lot of

271
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,479
outdoor growing i rock a greenhouse this

272
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,559
will be my second year growing in a

273
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,480
greenhouse that's not outdoor growing

274
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,239
it's close it's greenhouse growing but

275
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
when you ask me greenhouse growing

276
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,759
questions i call jessie or when you ask

277
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,360
me outdoor growing questions i call

278
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,519
jesse i go hey bro somebody asked me

279
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959

280
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,039
[ __ ] back to you on the show i'm not the

281
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,399
wizard of oz but luckily i've got a big

282
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,159
team i've got people that i can call

283
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,839
there are other consultants that i work

284
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,439
with that they call me too they're like

285
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,800
hey bro i've got this weird [ __ ]

286
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,079
thing going on in my grow can you help

287
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,159
me and i'll take a look and i'll go oh

288
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,599
it's because of that and so we just do

289
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,519
each other favors just call each other

290
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,120
back and forth so my panic button what

291
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,360
i'm getting at is i've got a lot more

292
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,959
resources in the commercial growth so i

293
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,639
will do a lot more in the commercial

294
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,399
growth to keep those plants alive to

295
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,879
rescue them to save them and i don't let

296
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,879
them get too far [ __ ] up before i

297
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,679
really start taking drastic measures and

298
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,278
the personal grow i might go ah there's

299
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,519
some yellowing i might want to up the

300
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,278
nitrogen the next time i feed it if i

301
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,879
see yellowing in the commercial grow i'm

302
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,720
going and telling everybody bro the next

303
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,320
time we feed up the nitrogen pay a lot

304
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
of attention like there's a meeting

305
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,120
about it there's a lot of [ __ ] to be

306
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,799
done we're making sure that that

307
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,639
nitrogen gets added the next time we

308
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,879
might foliar feed like i don't let it

309
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,159
get too far it it's time to take action

310
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,399
uh and the commercial grows we're

311
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,719
running uh coco with perlite which is

312
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,480
basically hydro so the minute you feed

313
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,680
you're gonna start seeing reactions not

314
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
necessarily the minute but i mean you're

315
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,759
gonna see some [ __ ] change so in hydro

316
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,360
it can go really quickly so in a

317
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,600
commercial grow

318
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,278
i really uh it's

319
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,200
i try really hard not to let them get to

320
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,799
that panic mode but i will try to pull

321
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,640
them out we've had a pretty bad mite

322
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,958
infestation one of the things that i

323
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,278
talk about one of my goals uh one of the

324
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,439
things i pitch myself as is i'm able to

325
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,679
help get rid of bugs and problems and

326
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,079
turn a problematic grow around so i've

327
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,838
been hired to take over grows that were

328
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,479
infested with spider mites grows that

329
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,880
were infested with powdery mildew and i

330
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,720
almost have more fun turning a grow

331
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,958
around than walking into a girl that's

332
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,959
doing well and just keeping it going or

333
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,239
making it better i like a good [ __ ]

334
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,838
it sounds maybe it's because i've been

335
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,278
grown for so long and it's more of a

336
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,640
it's more fun to me i like a nice

337
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,879
challenging grow a grow that's got

338
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,720
spider mites and powdery mildew and got

339
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,799
nine bad employees that's a great grow

340
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,639
for me to walk into because i can cure

341
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,479
spider mites i can cure powdery mildew

342
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,399
and i can get rid of nine bad employees

343
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,039
and get five bad ass people to rock that

344
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,240
facility so it's kind of a fun thing i

345
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,000
like fixing things so i don't i like

346
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
being in the weeds so i don't throw [ __ ]

347
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,039
away i don't give up my

348
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,958
there's

349
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,958
uh it sounds crazy maybe i've grown so

350
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,039
much weed that it's like i can do that

351
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,958
sure we can do that we can turn rooms

352
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,199
and cut down a crop and have that room

353
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,278
running tomorrow in flower again we

354
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
never missed 12 hours of a day in that

355
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,519
room with plants it was [ __ ] i can do

356
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,120
that so now it's more fun for me to try

357
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,560
to go into those rooms that are

358
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,159
problematic and kind of start in the

359
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,319
weeds like i said it's more fun to dig

360
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,240
myself out of a hole and then try to fix

361
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,920
that and then give myself so many crops

362
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,000
to have this goal

363
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,519
buy five crops out of this facility

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,278
we'll be kicking up this much product

365
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,278
and we'll get this much thc percentage

366
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,559
and we'll get this much concentrate

367
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,720
percentage and we'll get this much

368
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,638
customer retention and i try to work on

369
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,959
those sorts of things so i almost have

370
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,799
fun pulling myself out of the weeds

371
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,638
a lot of it is just having

372
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,078
knowing if you've got the resources can

373
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680
you repair the problem knowing that

374
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,559
you've got the time can you invest the

375
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,799
time

376
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,078
or is it going to be how far back is

377
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,519
that problem going to set you is it

378
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,599
going to set you two weeks back would it

379
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,919
be easier just to cut new clones get

380
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,399
them going maybe that is easier let me

381
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,559
focus you said newt lock

382
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
nutrient lockout depending on when if

383
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,518
it's like it's usually going to happen

384
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,440
right as you switch that usually happens

385
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,639
when you go from veg into the flowering

386
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,639
stage

387
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,799
your transition phase is going to suck

388
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,000
but your stretch phase is going to suck

389
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,679
your plants are going to look like [ __ ]

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
but you haven't started getting bud set

391
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,838
yet

392
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,759
so you've got a new lockout and you've

393
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,600
still got like six weeks to go you've

394
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,360
you figured it out like day 10 of flour

395
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
it started showing signs by 14 you're

396
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,680
ready to make corrections i would mix up

397
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,239
a solid batch of nutrients that you know

398
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,399
is correct a good base nutrient some

399
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,278
good microbes in there but your calcium

400
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,198
your magnesium your phosphorus potassium

401
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,639
molybdenum get all the good [ __ ] that

402
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,519
you need and they're all the basics of

403
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,759
perfectly balanced meal perfectly ph to

404
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,240
the perfect dc and then feed that to

405
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,838
those plants on that day and that's i

406
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,919
would start correcting it from that day

407
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,079
now you've got six or seven more weeks

408
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,159
to go before that plant's even done

409
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,439
you're gonna transition out of that [ __ ]

410
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,120
phase where it's looking like it's been

411
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,240
beat up it's gonna take about a week

412
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,240
then you're going to get a bunch of new

413
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,680
growth then you're going to get bud set

414
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
and you're going to get buds you haven't

415
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,519
even started developing buds yet to do

416
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,839
any damage to them so why not just keep

417
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,000
pushing on through if that loot newt

418
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,639
lock happens later on when you start

419
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,720
adding the bloom boosters at that point

420
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,600
you're [ __ ] six weeks in just push on

421
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,240
through and finish the buds

422
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,600
once you're like four or five weeks past

423
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,879
a lot of people might just cut it down

424
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,320
once you're four or five weeks into

425
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,679
flower a lot of people may consider

426
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,680
cutting it down if they've got spider

427
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,919
mites or a nutrient lockout but you're

428
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,278
so close to the finish line why not just

429
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,799
push through it you may not get the

430
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,639
outcome that you wanted you may not get

431
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,799
the product that you wanted the weight

432
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,560
the yield the potency the flavor the

433
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,240
dank photos but you're gonna get a

434
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,159
learning experience push on through and

435
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,560
have something to show for your work i

436
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,719
wouldn't give up um if you're in flower

437
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,958
keep going that's i never i would never

438
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,240
want to just give up and cut my losses

439
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,958
if i've made it all the way to the

440
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,639
flowering phase you've done veg work

441
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,119
it takes a lot of work to get up to that

442
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,039
phase so i always try to fix them i i

443
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,560
keep saying i really enjoy trying to fix

444
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,278
the plants it's really easy to grow herb

445
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,439
for me i why not try to fix these

446
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,198
problems and pull my way out of it so if

447
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,560
you got newt lock i would try to fix

448
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:13,759
that that's only going to set you back

449
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,278
two weeks

450
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,360
if you were going to pull a pound maybe

451
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,958
you're only going to pull 14 13 12

452
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
ounces now you're still going to have

453
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,000
product don't give up some is better

454
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,919
than none

455
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,519
the next example was over hot and

456
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,838
stunted growth

457
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,039
over hot let's talk about too much heat

458
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,320
as soon as you change the temperature

459
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,919
they'll start growing back they're going

460
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,079
to be tall and skinny and lanky and kind

461
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,679
of pissed off but as soon as you correct

462
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,519
the temperature they'll start growing

463
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,799
back unless you meant overhot by too

464
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,720
much food which um depending on how bad

465
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,120
you roasted them you may be able to

466
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,199
recover them feed them a normal diet

467
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
dial back the nutrients they may recover

468
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,599
from that as well

469
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,360
the other one is stunted growth

470
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
if they look super pissed off if you're

471
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,919
embarrassed about it and you just want

472
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,360
to start over sometimes you just have

473
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,599
that feeling inside you're like [ __ ]

474
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,440
these plants if you feel

475
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
[ __ ] these plants then just cut them

476
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,079
down and start over because you're never

477
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,519
going to

478
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,439
give them the love and care that they

479
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,120
deserve because you've already got that

480
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,639
that [ __ ] these plants feeling in your

481
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,240
heart and you're not going to change

482
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,278
that you might try to convince yourself

483
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,879
that you're going to take care of them

484
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,039
and pull them through but once your

485
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,198
heart and your brain decide man [ __ ]

486
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,958
these plants it that they know it too

487
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,879
the plants heard you say that the plants

488
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,559
felt you say that and so that is the

489
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,559
point when i would just kind of cut them

490
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,479
down give up at that point i have never

491
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,638
lost a commercial crop i've never cut

492
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,680
down an entire commercial crop and given

493
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,440
up i've had commercial crops that were

494
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,439
not up to the standards that i would

495
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,199
like them to be they definitely did not

496
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,199
get posted to instagram there were no

497
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,879
pictures but i've never cut down an

498
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,599
entire crop in a commercial grow and

499
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,958
given up i have cut down crops in my

500
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,639
private grow

501
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,278
because we discovered that the whole

502
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,198
back corner excuse me

503
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,198
i did cut down an entire crop in my

504
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,278
private grill one time because mike and

505
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,120
i discovered that the back corner uh it

506
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,039
was wintertime and this one back corner

507
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,039
at the exterior part of the house uh

508
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,199
that whole corner i said whole corner

509
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,798
excuse me for that that entire corner

510
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,720
got powdery mildew there were some big

511
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,798
beefy plants back there but we noticed

512
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,959
the powdery mildew along the back wall

513
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,119
the buds were late into flower i wasn't

514
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,120
experienced and knowledgeable as

515
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,479
knowledgeable as i am now to know what

516
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,078
to have done about it so we just went

517
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,919
and cut down all those plants i knew

518
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,918
that um they weren't healthy they

519
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,360
weren't safe they weren't any good so i

520
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,079
just cut all those down because there

521
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,759
was so much powdery mildew that treating

522
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,200
them spraying them cleaning them up

523
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,279
still would not have made me happy i

524
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,960
would have felt gross about that

525
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,279
i was

526
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,440
working as a caregiver i was growing for

527
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,720
uh medical cannabis patients and i was i

528
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,240
really thought about a couple of those

529
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,679
people i thought about my friend doug i

530
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,839
thought about what if i give doug or

531
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,600
mike some herb that's covered in powdery

532
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,599
mildew and we smoke it one of us or all

533
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,879
three of us get sick i'm gonna feel like

534
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,879
a [ __ ] my

535
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
job my goal as a cannabis grower as a

536
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
caregiver is to make people feel better

537
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,120
and heal them not to give them a lung

538
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,640
infection or a sinus problem or whatever

539
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,038
the [ __ ] else that powdery mildew could

540
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,799
have caused so i did cut down um i think

541
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,240
i cut down ninety percent of that crop

542
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,519
maybe we saved a few of the plants that

543
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,200
were up in the front but i do remember

544
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,279
cutting down all the [ __ ] in the back

545
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,279
there were uh white rhino plants with

546
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,599
buds the size of footballs and we were

547
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,480
really sad to cut that [ __ ] down but

548
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,319
sometimes you gotta cut your losses so

549
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,480
ninety percent of the time i would push

550
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,960
on through i would just because it's

551
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,120
rewarding um i do know that our friend

552
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,759
girls grow too has military experience

553
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,678
and you know that feeling of like uh i

554
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,359
said the example being in the weeds and

555
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,440
[ __ ] pulling through i know you've

556
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,719
got that that rewarding feeling inside

557
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,000
you of that accomplishment because

558
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,839
you're a soldier we've talked about

559
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,038
things like that i know that you've got

560
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,639
that feeling

561
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,160
that [ __ ] feels good when you're like

562
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,440
i'm going to fail i'm going to fail i'm

563
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
going to fail and then at week 10 you

564
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,360
cut some [ __ ] down and you've got usable

565
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,519
smokable tangible

566
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,279
enjoyable product it may not be cannabis

567
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,319
cup winning herb it may not be trophy

568
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,279
weed but you got something and without a

569
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,119
struggle

570
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,798
maybe it wasn't as enjoyable and you had

571
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,439
to learn something maybe it's better to

572
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,918
learn how to fight spider mites now than

573
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,600
it is way later on when you think you've

574
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,679
got when your grow is flowing when it's

575
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,199
humming you got more expensive genetics

576
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,120
you got more expensive lights and then

577
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
you get mites maybe it's good now to

578
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,479
find that sort of [ __ ] out when you're

579
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,400
beginning or maybe when you're newer and

580
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
then you can learn how to fight that

581
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,360
[ __ ] so when is it too late to save a

582
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,519
plant

583
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,678
that's really up to you that is really

584
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,160
up to you um

585
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,519
if it's cover if it's got webs on it it

586
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,038
might be time just to go if you've got

587
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,160
spider mite webs it might be time just

588
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:36,160
to cut that [ __ ] down um if it's got

589
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,720
powdery mildew it might be time to cut

590
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,798
that [ __ ] down um most of the other

591
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,640
things we can usually usually get rid of

592
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,918
now now i know how to get rid of powdery

593
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,679
mildew now i know how to get rid of

594
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,520
spider mites uh prevention is key uh use

595
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,519
use that feeling inside of oh [ __ ] i

596
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,119
want to give up to remind you of like

597
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,279
how did i get here maybe that's a good

598
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,000
thing to touch on how did i get to this

599
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,240
point if your plant is sick enough or

600
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,038
new locked out or over hot or stunted or

601
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,839
has bugs or mildew badly enough to where

602
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,759
you're thinking i might want to cut this

603
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:09,918
down think of that as like how did i get

604
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,079
here what kind of was it neglect was it

605
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,038
laziness was it uh ignorance was it

606
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,480
miseducation was it lack of uh

607
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,759
communication with the team maybe you

608
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
got somebody else helping you was it

609
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,720
lack of communication communication with

610
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,719
a partner

611
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,159
what happened why did we get powdery

612
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,839
mildew and spider mites to the level

613
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,600
where i've got to cut down all of these

614
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,439
plants think about that

615
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,279
then uh see how you can prevent that

616
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,640
from happening in future grows because

617
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,879
we definitely don't want to deal with

618
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,640
the problem twice but if you get that

619
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,159
[ __ ] these plants feeling that is

620
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,400
basically the only time that i would

621
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,400
really cut them down and sometimes i've

622
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,720
had that like

623
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,559
not [ __ ] these plants but yeah with

624
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,159
these plants you know it's borderline

625
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,279
and i've pulled those crops through

626
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,799
those did survive um not every crop has

627
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,960
been beautiful but i've had some that

628
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,038
have made me want to grab my dreads and

629
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,798
just start yanking so when is it too

630
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,359
late to save a plant that is really up

631
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,038
to your level of patience how badly do

632
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,558
you want to learn how bad do you need

633
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,400
the medicine if you're in veg and you

634
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,158
can tell like two or three weeks in that

635
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,320
that [ __ ] just isn't gonna work go ahead

636
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,480
and cut it down i always talk about last

637
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,158
winter or two winters ago the pandemic

638
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,000
really [ __ ] up my scheduling i have no

639
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,919
idea what year it is and how long it's

640
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,359
been anymore i felt like it was tuesday

641
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,000
for two years so i'm kind of [ __ ] up

642
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,879
on timing but at some point in life i

643
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,519
decided to switch from uh hps high

644
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,960
pressure sodium lights to led lighting

645
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,480
and when i did

646
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,240
the plants looked like total [ __ ] and

647
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,599
honestly a few weeks into flower i just

648
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,359
went in and cut them all the [ __ ] down

649
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,199
and started over because

650
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,038
they were not gonna do anything good

651
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,240
from what i was seeing from those plants

652
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:41,839
nothing good was gonna come out of that

653
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,519
room i was gonna have a headache i was

654
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,119
gonna have a struggle i was gonna have

655
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,480
tall shitty plants that were getting

656
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,798
burnt by the light that were never gonna

657
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,400
meet my goals so like week three i just

658
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,879
said bucket and i cut every single one

659
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,000
of those plants down about 25 days into

660
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
flour

661
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,599
chopped them all up yeah mike was really

662
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,919
heartbroken over that but it for me it

663
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,359
was like i can do better than this and

664
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,360
what i did was i learned how to grow

665
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,639
under leds i made some adjustments and i

666
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,119
pulled through and i did it better the

667
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,240
next time so that's that is two crops i

668
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,119
guess that i've

669
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,519
cut down uh the powdery mildew crop and

670
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,279
the failed led crop are crops that i cut

671
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,599
down just because i wasn't happy i was

672
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,359
frustrated but that is up to you how bad

673
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,439
do you need the herb how frustrated are

674
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,199
you how much do you want to learn

675
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,200
do you have an opportunity to get more

676
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,519
plants do you have a backup plan that is

677
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,519
something i may keep in mind all right

678
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,839
girls grow too i feel like i rambled on

679
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,200
and on about that question i hope i

680
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,079
helped you out i hope i gave you some

681
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,480
useful advice it's all about your level

682
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,720
of frustration what will you accept how

683
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,079
far will you take it all right girls

love for you this one goes like this it

703
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,279
says hey ross to jeff long time listener

704
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,679
first time caller here it says when

705
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,399
you're growing a small crop in a four by

706
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,880
four tent or maybe a five by five tent

707
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,120
what size pots do you go with that is a

708
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,600
really good really universal really

709
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,000
common question it does go on it says

710
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,879
would reducing my pot size from a three

711
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,278
gallon to a two gallon pot help reduce

712
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,520
stretch to use fabric or plastic pots is

713
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,079
one superior to the other this is a

714
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,400
great line of questioning i do like this

715
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,720
shout out to you jh um when i'm growing

716
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,880
a small crop in a four by four or a five

717
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,640
by five what size pots do i go with that

718
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,520
depends on my goal

719
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,000
um

720
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,679
if i am running new plants and just

721
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
running new [ __ ] and trying to take some

722
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,559
pictures and see what we just made i may

723
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,599
do one or two gallon pots sometimes i

724
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,918
may do uh beer cups i may do a now

725
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,759
honestly we are limited to uh plant

726
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,559
counts here in colorado so in a personal

727
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,839
grow

728
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,678
that's going to be way different we'll

729
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,599
touch on that as the as the uh the

730
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,600
theories and the ideas of this progress

731
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,519
keep in mind in a commercial grow i can

732
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,519
run as many plants as i want in a

733
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,278
commercial grow if you're in a home grow

734
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,200
follow the legal limits follow the rules

735
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,119
there that is quite often what

736
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,600
determines how many plants i put where

737
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,839
is legal limits and things so if i were

738
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,439
to do a 4x4 and i was to put a bunch of

739
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,519
beer cups in there i may consider

740
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,679
putting like 100 beer cups in there

741
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,000
maybe put like 10 rows of 10 and just

742
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,600
space them out just a little bit but i'm

743
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,759
limited to plant count so i wouldn't do

744
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,119
that here in colorado we'll segue into

745
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,359
what i would do here

746
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,199
maybe you would do a bunch of one gallon

747
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,558
pots and you could probably fit

748
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,200
i'm gonna guess you could probably fit

749
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,278
10 or 12 of those in a five by five so i

750
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,960
would just say 10 by 10 there you go 100

751
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,119
again you're just taking up some of that

752
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,759
cup space maybe it's only eight of those

753
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,319
but i would do uh maybe that's 64 one

754
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,919
gallon pots in there and that crams them

755
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,079
in real tight then we're only vegging to

756
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,840
about 10 or 12 inches tall and then

757
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,839
flowering and getting just getting in

758
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,158
and getting out really quick so maybe

759
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,678
you would do like 16 one gallon pots and

760
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,679
just have them in there real tight maybe

761
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,600
you could do 25 one gallon pots i'm not

762
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,360
sure how tight that would fit in there i

763
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,599
can't visualize it i think i could see

764
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,319
five one gallon pots across that five by

765
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,000
five or four by four uh so you got 25 of

766
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,000
them in there but a more practical

767
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,278
application that we would run in a tent

768
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,839
and a five by five maybe you could do ah

769
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:43,359
9 12 maybe 15 maybe 16 3 gallon pots

770
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,278
depends on how tightly you want to pack

771
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,199
them in there if you're gonna veg for a

772
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,119
short time put more pots in there if

773
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,038
you're gonna veg for a long time put

774
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,158
less pots in there something that i

775
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,759
frequently do is nine three gallon pots

776
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,200
and a five by five that works

777
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,679
beautifully for me that gives the plants

778
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,840
enough space i let me grow them up to

779
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,919
about my knee-high then i flower them

780
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,720
they finish at just the right height so

781
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,440
nine three gallon pots is quite often a

782
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,000
very good very successful grow or if

783
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,400
you're more limited on plant count four

784
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,038
seven gallon pots is beautiful in a five

785
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,960
by five i like to do four seven gallon

786
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,919
pots and a trellis net and pull them all

787
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,480
down or if you want to run a perpetual

788
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,440
grow in a five by five environment i

789
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,759
recommend four seven gallon pots and you

790
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,840
put one in every two weeks and take one

791
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,278
out every two weeks so you've got one

792
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,959
that's in there at two weeks one that's

793
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,480
in there at four weeks one that's in

794
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,759
there at six one that's in there at

795
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,440
eight and then hopefully you got a

796
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,599
cultivar that finishes right at eight

797
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,759
weeks and you can just rotate every two

798
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,038
weeks you take a plan out harvest it put

799
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,679
a new plant in there and put it into

800
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,240
flour four seven gallon pots work

801
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,559
beautifully in that five by five that is

802
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,640
probably what i would do uh running a

803
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,558
small crop in a four by four you're

804
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,480
probably looking at like a whole bunch

805
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:59,599
of one gallon pots i'm guessing you

806
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
could probably do

807
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,839
like ten of them across this one gallon

808
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,440
pots are little uh the ones i'm thinking

809
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,879
about you probably fit ten across that's

810
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,720
like 100 of those if you really wanted

811
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,600
to cram them in there if you want some

812
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,278
space maybe do 64. uh and then start

813
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:17,759
working up to 3 gallon pots where you're

814
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:19,599
doing like maybe maybe 12 maybe 16 maybe

815
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,599
9 it just depends on how big the plants

816
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,879
and how much space you want to have if

817
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,319
the plants are bigger you need more

818
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
space of course if the plants are

819
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,200
smaller you don't need as much space for

820
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,440
them to grow that does segue me into the

821
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,600
next part would reducing my pot size

822
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,360
from three gallon to two gallon help

823
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,678
reduce stretch no i believe it would do

824
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:40,558
uh kind of the opposite i believe that

825
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,720
the plants um they know how wide their

826
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,918
pot is and you'll notice that the plants

827
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,399
generally unless you do some

828
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,399
manipulating they don't branch out much

829
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,398
wider than the

830
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,479
size of your pot if you get keep your

831
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,000
plant in a two gallon pot that's only

832
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,038
what's this eight ten inches around i'm

833
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,119
a drummer that's i'm gonna say that's

834
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,440
ten inches around if you keep your plant

835
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,678
in a ten inch around pot the root base

836
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,759
only gets ten inches if you look up that

837
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,278
plant it only spread out about 10 inches

838
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,759
maybe those bottom branches where it got

839
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,679
real far maybe they went 14 18 inches

840
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,599
but not much further than that 10 inch

841
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,919
base then if you put that plant in a

842
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:16,158
wider pot you'll notice it will widen

843
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,000
out that is because it knows it's like

844
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,080
um i don't know it's sort of a gravity

845
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,440
thing maybe just knows that if i get i

846
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,359
can't get too wide because my feet

847
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,919
aren't big enough to hold me up i'm 6'5

848
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,599
maybe that's why i wear size 13 shoes

849
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,000
need that bigger pot for that bigger

850
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,000
plant that is my theory that is just my

851
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,558
theory and my experience they get whiter

852
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
when you put them in a wider pot so um

853
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:37,759
they'll stretch up more if you put them

854
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,359
in a skinnier pot also you're probably

855
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,720
going to put them closer together when

856
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,798
they get all close together like that

857
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,440
they don't like to grow uh out they like

858
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,119
to grow up somebody recently asked me uh

859
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,720
why plants would get angry if i put them

860
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,639
too close together why they would get

861
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,919
stretchy they're just angry uh they're

862
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,278
they can't grow out the way that they

863
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,799
want to they gotta grow up they get

864
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,079
stretchy trying to get to the light

865
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,599
because the light's not penetrating

866
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:58,960
because they're so close together

867
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,639
they're just mad they want to grow out

868
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,120
but they can't so they just grow up to

869
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,520
fight for the light there is more uh do

870
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,278
you use fabric pots or plastic pots in a

871
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,960
commercial environment i use three

872
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:14,558
gallon fabric pots with uh 70 cocoa and

873
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,640
30 perlite with two drip emitters per

874
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,639
pot each drip emitter comes from a

875
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,799
different reservoir so i can feed two

876
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,240
different feeds during the day if i want

877
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:23,759
to um

878
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,640
lots of different controls so i can mix

879
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,480
up a reservoir reservoir a will have one

880
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,720
feed and res a will have a resby will

881
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,480
have another feed so that i can feed one

882
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,759
part throughout the day and then right

883
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,839
before they go to bed i can feed them

884
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,440
with another thing if i so choose to or

885
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,278
i can just run clean water through one

886
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,399
if we decide to clean them out so in the

887
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,278
commercial environment

888
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,759
uh fabric three gallon fabric pots 70

889
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,440
cocoa 30 perlite two drip emitters

890
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,879
running from two different reservoirs so

891
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,679
we could feed two different nutrient

892
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,200
solutions uh and the home grow

893
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,960
i switch it up all the [ __ ] time

894
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,759
honestly i'm currently using the tall

895
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,600
five gallon plastic pots um

896
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,359
during the the pandy [ __ ] was hard to

897
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,558
get and those were what was available so

898
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,599
that's what i grabbed from my local

899
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,839
groce store i am very versatile very

900
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,398
flexible i can work with what i've got

901
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,918
um i'd like to have some [ __ ] but those

902
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,319
were the parts that were there so that's

903
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,480
what i grabbed is one superior to the

904
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,158
other uh no it's all about your goal all

905
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,120
about your intent all about your purpose

906
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,640
they both have pros and cons um

907
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,158
the one thing i don't like about the

908
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,600
fabric pots is if you don't get them

909
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,600
full and don't pack them up right the

910
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,278
water will kind of run out of the sides

911
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,278
but also i like that you can't over

912
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,240
water them because the water will run

913
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:38,240
out of the side so pros and cons there

914
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,319
my friend j.h i think i answered your

915
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,919
question at least this one i've got a

916
