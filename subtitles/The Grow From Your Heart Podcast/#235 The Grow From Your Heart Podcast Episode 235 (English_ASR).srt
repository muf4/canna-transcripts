00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:24,939
episode I talked about going to see

36
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,560
Steve Simone at comedy works and let me

37
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:29,469
tell you it was better than I had

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,879
anticipated I drove up to Denver and I

39
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:32,200
met up with the always lovely always

40
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,879
beautiful miss Jenny Beth she was in

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,700
Denver doing some Denver stuff her and I

42
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,289
met up we hung out we get a little

43
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,179
stoned in a parking garage we may have

44
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:41,679
taken some ridiculous sized ads in a

45
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:43,990
parking garage before we went to see the

46
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:46,090
show so we got super dabbed out and we

47
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:48,579
headed into comedy works but on the way

48
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,640
to comedy works I tweeted I said I am

49
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:53,890
driving 125 miles to see Steve Simone

50
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,030
talk about Chinese food because Steve

51
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,290
Simone does a bit about Chinese food

52
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,420
we'll get to that in a second

53
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,460
but Steve Simone retweeted it and liked

54
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,320
it and replied with I can't wait to see

55
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,548
you which had me excited because I met

56
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,809
Steve Simone a couple times and we've

57
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:07,299
hung out but we've never really

58
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,679
interacted a lot he did however send me

59
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:10,060
a letter and some stickers in the mail a

60
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,400
little while back so he knows I exist

61
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,150
and we have interacted I sent the tweet

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,319
he liked it he replied when I got there

63
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,789
they walked me and they're always lovely

64
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,469

have taken great care of them we go up

69
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,989
front and Steve Simone is in front of

70
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,280
the stage like setting up his microphone

71
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:31,989
and making sure everything's cool and he

72
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,310
sees me and he goes hey buddy and he

73
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,629
gave me a hug and told me that he loved

74
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,599

75
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,500

76
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,459
like all right man I'll be right back

77
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,819
and he had to disappear he went

78
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,289
backstage the show started and there's

79
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,120
another opener whose name I cannot

80
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,919
recall right now the opener was funny

81
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,989
the main opener kind of the host of the

82
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,399
show he was funny but he told a joke

83
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,500
that was a ripoff

84
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,299
from Joey Diaz if anybody listens to the

85
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,769
podcast frequently you know I'm a comedy

86
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:58,090
nerd you know I let's do a lot of comedy

87
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:59,920
and you were never gonna tell a Joey

88
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,810
[ __ ] Diaz joke and it's gonna slide by

89
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,579
me this guy made a joke about being

90
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,349
allergic to peanuts and he said how are

91
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,820
we gonna be Isis if we can't beat up

92
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:08,469
Pina and that's a [ __ ] Joey Diaz

93
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,620
ripoff he's centered on the podcast I

94
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:12,550
also heard him sit in a live comedy show

95
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,810
my advice to you is if you're an

96
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,010
up-and-coming comedian don't ruin your

97
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,199
[ __ ] career by stealing somebody

98
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:18,579
else's joke this dude had me I was

99
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,619
laughing and then he said a Joey Diaz

100
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,120
joke and lost me anyway after that guy

101
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,159
was a comedian by the name of Brant

102
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,750
Tobler Brant Tobler did not steal any

103
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,120
material Brant Tobler was [ __ ]

104
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,560
hilarious the whole show that had me

105
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,370
laughing my ass off being down there in

106
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,659
the front row you get a lot of

107
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,770
interaction so they look you straight in

108
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,879
the face they make sure that you're

109
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,620
laughing because that's the only way

110
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,819
they know if the jokes are going well so

111
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,439
they pay a lot attention to my laughter

112
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,189
I try to laugh and let him know hey bro

113
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,620
you're doing a good job

114
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:43,030
Brant Tobler was hilarious he told a

115
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,159
couple of really good he tells long

116
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,140
stories his jokes are long his bits are

117
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,549
long and I enjoy that it gets you sucked

118
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,409
in you feel involved and then all of a

119
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,030
sudden there's just this funny this wave

120
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:53,979
of funny and once you're so invested in

121
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,449
a story these guys can tell you seven or

122
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:57,759
eight punchlines just after telling you

123
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:59,079
his story and I was laughing so hard my

124
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,149
face hurt a little bit from Brant

125
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,560
Tobler's jokes but anyway Brant Tobler

126
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,480
finished up he probably did a good 25

127
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,569
the first guy did 15 Brent Tobler

128
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,429
probably did 25 and then my buddy mr.

129
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,530
Steve Simone the host of the good times

130
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,319
with steep Simone podcast came out and

131
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,298
did it was a long show I don't know how

132
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,769
long he did but he just sits on this

133
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,539
little there's a barstool he sits on the

134
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,858
barstool and he just got comfortable it

135
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,750
felt like I was just hanging out with

136
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:24,159
Steve Simone he was right in my face he

137
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,480
was right in front of me just telling

138
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,420
jokes to me in the front row right there

139
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,540
it was pretty hilarious so I mentioned

140
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,870
earlier that I tweeted about Chinese

141
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,090
food so if you know Steve Simone Steve

142
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,129
Simone can do a lot of material on

143
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,929
Chinese food he can make you laugh for

144
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:43,689
three hours about Chinese food and I've

145
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,459
heard a lot of it the material I've

146
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:47,469
heard about Chinese food was always

147
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:49,539
about him being an adult and getting

148
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,010
Chinese food his the most popular bit is

149
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,569
and I'm not gonna ruin his bit but I'll

150
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,099
give you the premise that when Chinese

151
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,449
food you order Chinese food and it's

152
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,100
mysterious because you don't know what

153
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,750
the [ __ ] on the menu is you're like what

154
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,790
what what does this mean what are these

155
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,019
words and it's all like mystical in the

156
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,340
order and I'm not doing his jokes

157
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:04,810
justice I'm not trying I don't want it

158
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:06,879
to be dumb so that if you do hear his ah

159
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,050
you can still laugh at his jokes and

160
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,180
then he talks about when the food

161
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,710
arrives all these containers show up and

162
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,180
all these adults are arguing over who's

163
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:14,349
is what because nobody even knows what

164
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,430
they ordered and then you look at your

165
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,689
friends and you're like damn that looks

166
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,399
good

167
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,409
it'd serve one ends up trading a scoop

168
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,178
and it's all about being an adult and

169
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:22,618
how amazing Chinese food is and I know

170
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:24,778
it sounds crazy that the guy can tell

171
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:26,369
three hours of jokes I saw him do 45

172
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:28,738
minutes on Chinese food the last time I

173
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,819
saw him so he talked about Chinese food

174
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:31,798
for a long time right

175
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,829
Steve Simone did his act this time at

176
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:36,568
comedy works he probably went for 30 45

177
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:38,309
minutes and then he sat on a stool and

178
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,449
he pushed his sleeves on his sweater up

179
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,979
and he looked me in the face and he goes

180
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,899
you guys want to hear about the first

181
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:43,918
time I ate Chinese food and that's not

182
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,718
exactly what he said but that's

183
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,859
basically how how he did it and he

184
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:48,238
looked me straight in the face and he's

185
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,519
like well here's the first time I had

186
00:05:48,238 --> 00:05:52,709
Chinese food and he proceeded to tell

187
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,809
the story of the how he discovered

188
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:57,179
Chinese food and going to the restaurant

189
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:58,289
to get Chinese food and one of the parts

190
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:59,638
that caught me was he walked in the

191
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:01,678
restaurant he goes I walked in and

192
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,079
there's a giant mother-effing dragon and

193
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:05,698
I'm like I'm home yeah it's not exactly

194
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,129
how he tells the bits I'm not steep

195
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,899
Simone but it's [ __ ] hilarious so I

196
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,699
got to he did I feel like he kind of did

197
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,678
that for me he looked me directly in the

198
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,869
face and was like you want to hear about

199
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:17,278
my first time eat Chinese food as I

200
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:18,539
tweeted him that and he totally knew

201
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:20,579
that I was coming to see the Chinese

202
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,348
food joke and they always lovely always

203
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,519
beautiful miss Jenny Beth grabbed my leg

204
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,438
and gave me a little squeeze like hey

205
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,759
maybe this parts for you it was so cool

206
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,409
that we had that little connection with

207
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,908
Steve so Steve did the show and it was

208
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:31,860
hilarious the show ended and everybody

209
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:34,228
applauded and I'm up in the front row so

210
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,729
honestly that's the last seat to get out

211
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,808
of the venue like when the show ends

212
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,248
you're stuck because there's all these

213
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:39,389
people that were behind you now they're

214
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,249
actually the front of the line so

215
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,959
they're escaping the show first but I

216
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,849
was in no hurry because I knew I know

217
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,069
Steve Simone I know him very well he

218
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:48,538
went to the backstage to go like catch

219
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,069
his breath probably when got a bottle of

220
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,058
water took a break calm down for just a

221
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,278
couple of minutes and then he walked

222
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:54,689
right out from backstage up to me and he

223
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:56,308
had a tray of food in his hand he goes

224
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,619
hey buddy I've got a bunch of food if

225
00:06:56,309 --> 00:07:00,360

226
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,189
[ __ ] I go I'm a vegetarian and he said

227
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,749
there's cheese pizza like he already

228
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,819
knew he's like there's cheese pizza

229
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:07,649
buddy don't worry he solved all the

230
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,218
problems he's like pizza pizza is a

231
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:10,199
back-up plan

232
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:11,968
I've got pizza for you and so I was like

233
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,709
well [ __ ] yeah and he goes stay right

234
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:14,968
here and Steve Simone went and wandered

235
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,259
around Comedy Works had to go talk to a

236
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:19,168
few people you know he was schmoozing it

237
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,369
up and then I I didn't see him for a few

238
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:22,198
minutes and so I walked down this one

239
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:24,240
little corridor Jenni and I walked down

240
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,829
the corridor and he goes hey come on and

241
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,899
he was just in this little back area by

242
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:28,769
himself setting up plates of food and he

243
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:29,639
was like come on buddy

244
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,840
and I went back

245
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,400
he's like man all this foods available

246
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,288

247
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,318
people had brought Steve

248
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:39,120
there was pasta there was male there was

249
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,919

there was pizza there were little

251
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,589
Tupperware dishes full of stuff that I

252
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,090
didn't even bother to open because there

253
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,788
was so much stuff there I didn't need to

254
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:50,008
find more food Steve was just grubbin

255
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:51,568
and munching down and Brandt Tobler came

256
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,788
back and Brandt Tobler Steve Simone

257
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,800
Jenny Beth and myself basically ate

258
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:57,568
dinner together I know it sounds like I

259
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,189
might be telling a story but we all sat

260
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,319
around and we ate dinner and [ __ ]

261
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:03,090
about life and it's really funny Steve

262
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,098
Simone does not use any profanity on

263
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,478
stage Steve doesn't cuss at all he's a

264
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:08,639
pretty good dude he wants to be able to

265
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,348
have he says grown-ups he's 40 years old

266
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,639
and he still calls adult grown-ups cuz

267
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:13,709
he's a little kid at heart which is what

268
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,990
I love about him and he's so honest and

269
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,908
so genuine and just so grateful for life

270
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,918
but I kind of forgot what the [ __ ] I was

271
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:21,089
gonna say now grown-ups he doesn't cuss

272
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,740
he wants to have a show for grown-ups

273
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:24,448
and that you could bring little kids to

274
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,740
he says he wants you want your grandma

275
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:27,718
to bring your grandson to the show and

276
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,150
have a good time his kind of his theory

277
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:32,009
and he was doing something and he said

278
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,838

gratitude list I'm grateful to spend a

328
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,159
few moments with one of my favorite

329
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,450
comedians who changed my attitude who

330
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,219
gave me a little different outlook on

331
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,110
life at least maybe for a few days but

332
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,360
it did stick in the back of my head so

333
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,560

334

guys I'm sure you don't wanna hear too

341
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,169
much about the dab session with my

342
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,500
girlfriend in the car let's talk more

343
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:30,329
about cannabis I want to do something

344
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,340
that may make me sound like a little bit

345
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:35,100
of an [ __ ] but it will make you a

346
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,710
better cannabis advocate or a cannabis

347
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,259
spokesperson in the future I hear a lot

348
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,870
of people say the wrong terminology when

349
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:44,490
it comes to cannabis and I I feel like

350
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,070
I'm responsible for teaching you the

351
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,470
correct terms I'm sort of a historian of

352
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,060
sorts I guess when I'm I'm podcasting

353
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm an archivist you know I mean we're

354
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,059
marking history and the people that are

355
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,310
involved in cannabis right now our

356
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:57,839
pioneers we're starting an industry that

357
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:59,129
is very new and there are a lot of

358
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,660
people that are coming in that are new

359
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:02,970
that are saying that are just simply

360
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,649
making word mistakes one letter mistakes

361
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,300
and I want to correct you I'm not coming

362
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:07,949
to be an [ __ ] I want you to sound

363
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,529
like a better smarter grower

364
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,180
smarter advocate because people already

365
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,379
think we're lazy pockets people think

366
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:15,000
we're stoners people think we're not

367
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,980
paying attention so I think it's a

368
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,350
little important that we take the extra

369
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,149
effort to speak correctly to spell

370
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,230
correctly to have good grammar if you're

371
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:24,360
gonna put your [ __ ] out there in public

372
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,759
make it presentable so that people don't

373
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,980
think you're a lazy stoner so with all

374
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,840
that being said I've kind of created a

375
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,759
glossary and some things that I want to

376
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,080
go over it's just a short list and and I

377
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,759
I'm not trying to be an [ __ ] about it

378
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,650
it sounds like I'm being a stuck-up jerk

379
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,569
but I really want you to sound smarter

380
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:40,949
and I feel embarrassed for good growers

381
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,810
when they say the wrong [ __ ] I'm like ah

382
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:47,370
because ah one one thing can ruin all of

383
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:48,809
your credibility especially being a

384
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,639
pothead people already don't take you

385
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,769
seriously so if you go bruh too many

386
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,389
times they've already been respect you

387
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,740
you've lost credibility so if you say

388
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:58,120
try chromes instead of trichomes

389
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,560
you're gonna [ __ ] up your credibility so

390
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,539
that's the first thing we're gonna start

391
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,309
with the word is trichomes those

392
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:05,079
crystals that grow in your plants those

393
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:08,379
little mushroom looking things they are

394
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,420
trichomes don't call mrs. their resin

395
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:15,309
glands you can say resin glands but they

396
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:18,519
are trichome T RI CH om e trichome not

397
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:21,429
trichrome not trichome not tri chromes

398
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,929
but just a trichome okay all right

399
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:24,549
that's our first glossary word of the

400
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:25,629
day you see how easy it's gonna be there

401
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:27,219
are a few people right now they just

402
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,559
went oh [ __ ] I've been saying that wrong

403
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,500
for so long Thank You Rasta Jeff so the

404
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:34,539
word is trichome try to comb your hair

405
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,129
try comb but don't put the bee in there

406
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,769
there's no bee it's not a try comb but

407
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:41,289
it's a try comb all right try comb all

408
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:43,000
right that was easy enough I don't feel

409
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:44,730
so bad now the next one you guys this

410
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,789
bugs the [ __ ] out of me for some reason

411
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,750
quit saying CBDs it's not plural CBD is

412
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:51,849
not pluralized

413
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,339
they say I want a weed with a lot of CB

414
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,879
beads bro come on you want cannabis with

415
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:59,260
CBD high in CBD do you have you and this

416
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:01,059
is my at my comparison do you ever ask

417
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:02,799
for a glass of water 'z no matter how

418
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,019
much water is in your glass it's still

419
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,338
just water it's not plural waters maybe

420
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:08,500
if you gathered water from two sources

421
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:10,000
and mixed them you might have waters but

422
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,250
as far as I'm concerned this bottle of

423
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,470
water right here is water not waters I

424
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,700
don't want waters I would like a water

425
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,430
or some water

426
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,259
so let's not pluralizing CBD it just

427
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:22,449
sounds wonky to me I don't think it's

428
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,549
correct its CBD you know there's only

429
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,620
one CBB there are different cannabinoids

430
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:29,379
there are different terpenoids but there

431
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,360
is only one CBD all right that's my

432
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,980
story I'm sticking with it next

433
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,740
this one's directed at somebody

434
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,000
specifically and I'm sorry I must

435
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,519
correct you because every time I hear

436
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,169
you say I go goddamnit I love you every

437
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,629
day every time I hear your voice I'm

438
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:45,159
proud that you're doing what you do but

439
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:48,370
but it bugs the [ __ ] out of me when

440
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,620
people call a slab of shatter or some

441
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,709
hash they call it dab I want to buy some

442
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,450
dab no please don't say that a dab is

443
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,949
the thing that is on the tip of your

444
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,410
dabber the dab is the part you're

445
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,730
consuming you don't buy dab you may buy

446
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,778
a bath if somebody's got a dabber

447
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,820
they're gonna put a dab on it you may

448
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:05,860
buy a DAB but you don't buy dab you

449
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,510
don't you don't I'm sorry you know who

450
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,680

451
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:10,578

452
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,798
love you I still love your podcast

453
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:15,169
just-just I'm not gonna call you I just

454
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:17,899
quit quit saying dad it's DAB's

455
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:20,088
you've got some concentrate ah you are

456
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,068
taking a DAB you're going to buy some

457
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,049
dabs maybe but it just bugs me when you

458
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:25,128
say I'm going to buy dab all right I

459
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:27,198
kind of feel like an [ __ ] for my

460
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:28,759
Corrections but some people are gonna

461
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,019
sound like better people just for me

462
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,829
helping you out a little bit I kind of

463
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:34,249
feel like it's my duty

464
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:36,888
so to recap that without feeling like a

465
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:39,259
jerk I am going to buy some concentrate

466
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:42,409
or I am going to buy some hash I'm going

467
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:45,589
to buy a slab and then I will take a dab

468
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:48,139
of my shatter I have got some dabs on my

469
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:51,049
shirt because I dropped some I've got a

470
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:53,659
dab stuck to the table that stuff works

471
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:55,669
but I don't have dabs stuck to my shirt

472
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,169
that just sounds weird I'm not mad at

473
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:59,539

474
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:01,759

476
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,369

482

529
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:15,129
raasta Jeff hey you have talked about

530
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,750
breeding on the podcast but what about

531
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,970
just making seeds of your favorite

532
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,828
strain I have slowly collected a lot of

533
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,019
genetics and I'm having to keep cutting

534
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:24,548
clones just to keep them around I love

535
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,019
to be able to make seeds and then put

536
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:27,879
them away while I experiment while I

537
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:30,369
experiment with new strains

538
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,380
for example I just bought a five pack of

539
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:34,959
jelly bean and have two females and one

540
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,760
male right now can i pollinate just one

541
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,919
section of one of the females to make

542
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:41,619
some seeds for later

543
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,509

560
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,610
hope you have got a candy store fee no

561
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,230
and an orange fee no there are good

562
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,549
chances of that if you pop five seeds

563
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,900
and you've you've got that mini if

564

you've got three around once a boy and

565
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,840
you've got two girls oh you'd be so

566
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,179
lucky to have the candy store in the

567
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,799
orange Fino the candy store one kind of

568
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,110
it smells like the candy store in the

569
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,339
mall is the best way to describe it you

570
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,959
know how some of the candy when you bite

571
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:34,939
into it it's got that real sweet but you

572
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,529
could taste it's still powdery and it's

573
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,150
like and it smells like jelly beans or

574
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:40,069
jelly I said jelly beans that's funny it

575
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,810
smells like jelly beans ah that's the

576
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:44,179
candy store fee no the orange feet Oh

577
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:44,599
smells like a glass of orange juice just

578
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,370
straight-up

579
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,199
orange juice with maybe like another

580
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:50,299
hint of like lemon or pineapple or

581
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,769
something but those are the two fee nose

582
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,359
that are well-known and if you've got

583
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,710
one of those you're a lucky dude if

584
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,889
you've got each of those you're super

585
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,450
lucky ah now you're male I'm not gonna

586
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,220
get too picky on male selection cuz

587
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,230
you've only got one but we do know that

588
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,269
it's a jelly bean so yes there is

589
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,789
nothing stopping you from putting that

590
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:10,670
male plant in with those two females and

591
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:12,950
letting him put pollen so you said ah

592
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,509
you said for example I just bought a

593
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,850
five pack can i pollinate just one

594
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,829
section of the females yes but that's a

595
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:20,389
pain in the ass I'm not getting pollen

596
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:23,269
on the other parts of the plant will be

597
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:25,040
a challenge what I would do is just put

598
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:26,690
I would put the male in the room about

599
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,159
14 days ahead and then I would put the

600
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,269
girl in there I would honestly if you

601
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,430
can keep them separate that's best

602
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:34,460
flower the male about 14 days ahead put

603
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,930
the girls in there if the girls about 21

604
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,480
days into flower that means if the boys

605
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,340
are gonna be about 35 days into flower

606
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,960
at that point Harry the boy into there

607
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,909
and shake it all over the girls now

608
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,620
those girls are totally pollinated one

609
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,410
thing you can do you can keep that boy

610
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:50,209
separate flower him out around day 14

611
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,910
you'll see him start dropping pollen

612
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,069
around day 20 to 25 to 30 he'll really

613
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,930
be dump it go in there with a jar or

614
00:19:55,069 --> 00:20:00,750
some sort of receptacle and gather that

615
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,910
pollen then put it into a container

616
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,259
you want to get before you put into a

617
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,600
container you need to get all of the

618
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,150
male flowers out the male flowers hold

619
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,919
moisture moisture destroys pollen you

620
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,420
have to get all of the moisture out of

621
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,940
this pollen if you want it to be viable

622
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,490
if you want to store it and keep it you

623
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,650
need to get all of the moisture out our

624
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,690
friend Tony mr. toad taught us a long

625
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,250
time ago about using silica packets to

626
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,230
take the moisture out so some silica

627
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,670
packets in your container are always a

628
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,549
good idea to get the moisture out of

629
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,710
your pollen you can use a screen on top

630
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:33,359
of a jar you put the screen over the jar

631
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,309
I've seen people use a pantyhose you

632
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,959
stretch it real tight you just rub with

633
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:38,519
a credit card rub the pollen through the

634
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,779
screen and the male flowers gather up on

635
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,490
the top and you just scrape those right

636
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,680
off and discard them get all the male

637
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,390
flowers out of there or you can just

638
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,210
shake that pollen into something like a

639
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,770
magazine or a bowl and you can use a

640
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,870
paintbrush and go in the other room and

641
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:53,940
just paint a couple of branches with

642
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:56,339
that pollen it's really hard to control

643
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,539
pollen because it if you sneeze you just

644
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,279
[ __ ] everything up and everything's

645
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,990
flying around the whole room so be

646
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,549
really careful with the pollen you just

647
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,200
need to get it from the plant to the

648
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:05,220
female and apply it carefully you can do

649
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,740
with a q-tip you can do with a

650
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,839
paintbrush I just do it open pollination

651
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,059
style I let the male do his magic to the

652
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,319
girls just exactly how it's supposed to

653
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,240
they drop pollen I give them a good

654
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,279
shake the girls receive the pollen the

655
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,599
whole plant is seated I know maybe you

656
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,849
don't want to pollinate your whole crop

657
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,129
the whole room but that's an easy way to

658
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:25,199
make plenty of seeds honestly here's

659
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,450
something that I just recently did this

660
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,880
works this is true I ran my normal

661
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,650
breeding program I put some Capleton I

662
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,360
talked about it on the podcast I made

663
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,310
more seeds of the Firefly I made more

664
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,899
morning dew seeds but I also wanted to

665
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:38,490
make some new crosses and I wanted to

666
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,950
make some stuff that was just for me I

667
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,870
wanted to make platinum tangi to arise I

668
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,269
wanted to make an indention to arise

669
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,889
I took a candid enchilada platinum tan

670
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,839
gene there were a couple others they

671
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,759
were in a beer cup those Red Solo cups

672
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,589
that you get at a party for the keg I

673
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,269
put enough soil in there to fill that up

674
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:56,009
I put a little plant a little clone in

675
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:57,389
there and I let it grow is probably six

676
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:58,950
or eight inches tall and then I put it

677
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,440
into the breeding chamber to flower with

678
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,970
all the other big girls and I got pollen

679
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,950
on it just like I did all the big girls

680
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,809
and those plants were maybe a foot tall

681
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,039
maybe 10 to 12 inches tall out of the

682
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:09,659
pot by the time they were finished I

683
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,549
just took one bamboo stick and put it in

684
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,990
there and they stayed up real light I

685
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:14,579
had to lean him up against [ __ ] to keep

686
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,380
him upright because they got

687
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:17,759
top-heavy but they stayed up they

688
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,620
survived they made it all the way

689
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,349
through the cycle I harvested him I got

690
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:25,528
between 30 and 50 seeds from each plant

691
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:27,839
it was in a beer cup so you need enough

692
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:29,220
light to breed a 400 watt light doesn't

693
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,629
do it for me when I'm breathing I don't

694
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,819
feel like the seeds are robust enough

695
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,710
and he don't get enough a 600 did it a

696
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:36,418
thousand watt light is really what I

697
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,340
like for breeding I feel like you need

698
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,640
that power of that much light to get

699
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:44,908
yourself enough seeds and viable seeds

700
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,440
so put just one light worth of small

701
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:48,059
plants just bedroom for a little while

702
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,830
to where they're tiny put one light in

703
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:51,599
there of girls and one male in there and

704
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:53,579
just let him go and you will make plenty

705
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,928
of seeds for yourself but like I said if

706
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,240
you just want to pollinate one section

707
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:59,038
gather that pollen into a container get

708
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,990
a paintbrush dip it into the pollen just

709
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,750
like you're gonna do if you're gonna

710
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,069
paint and then paint that right onto the

711
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,638
pollen all right onto the plant right

712
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:11,129
onto the little the thickest most robust

713
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:12,629
pistol wet hairs you can find those are

714
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,250
that's where you want to put it just you

715
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,139
want those thick robust hairs that are

716
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,278
just they're just ready those are the

717
00:23:16,138 --> 00:23:18,509
pistols you guys that is something we

718
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:20,819
should probably have gone over in the

719
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:22,079
glossary quits and hairs those are pears

720
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:24,450
those are pistol at hairs those are

721
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,250
those are known as pistols what their

722
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,450
job is is to collect the pollen they

723
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,859
collect the pollen and they slide the

724
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,179
pollen right down that and then they

725
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:32,339
continue on we don't need to talk about

726
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,298
what happens after that but anyway you

727
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:34,980
can tell that the plan has been

728
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:36,929
pollinated because those pistol it hairs

729
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,250
will turn brown and start crinkling up

730
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:39,899
over the next few days they'll start

731
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,909
crinkling up and turn it in and they'll

732
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:43,678
all be brown and crunchy that's a good

733
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:46,260
indicator that that section of the plant

734
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,940
has been pollinated um if you want to

735
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,648
pollinate one small section of the plant

736
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,240
if if you're gonna take pollen into a

737
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:52,979
room and you only want one plant

738
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,778
receiving pollen you can spray water on

739
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,099
the rest of the garden and hopefully

740
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:58,200
those plants will not be able to receive

741
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:00,750
pollen water deactivates pollen that's

742
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,880
why I'm so stressful about getting all

743
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:06,509
the male flowers and using a silica pack

744
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,950
in your pollen storage so spray the rest

745
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:10,408
of the plants take your male pollen in

746
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,139
there and paintbrush what you need to

747
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:14,639
and then spray the rest of the plant

748
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:16,229
down also if you feel like that's

749
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:18,089
necessary then spray yourself down to

750
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,679
deactivate off the pollen because you

751
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,119
don't want to take the pollen back into

752
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,110
the grow later or to somebody else's

753
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,879
grow or anything like that

754
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:26,558
so the simple answer is yes you can make

755
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,149
a bunch of seeds for yourself so that

756
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,859
you don't have to keep clones around if

757
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:32,739
you're using the male and the female of

758
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:35,408
the same strain you may be making f2 or

759
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,149
f3 or maybe even f4 or five of the

760
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:39,820
strain that you have purchased it just

761
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:42,250
depends on what a finial generation the

762
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:44,589
breeder you purchased it from has taken

763
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,240
it to I know DJ short likes to breed

764
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:47,980
things all the way up to like f4 or five

765
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,288
before he releases them so it doesn't

766
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,569
leave a lot of variation for you

767
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,919
breeding it to the F six or seven or

768
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:55,869
whatever it's going to which is gonna be

769
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,490
actually be a good thing for you there

770
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,808
are some breeders like gage green and

771
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,278
I'm not calling anybody out this is just

772
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:01,778
how they work I'm not saying gage sucks

773
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:04,960
or anything but gage green is known for

774
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:07,119
releasing f1 hybrids or poly hybrids so

775
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,370
when you breed those your f your he's

776
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,808
given you F ones you're going to make f2

777
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,449
if you take a male and a female of the

778
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:15,609
same seed stock and you cross them those

779
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,649
you are now making an f2 finial

780
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:19,148
generation kind of it depends on how the

781
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:20,558
first ones were bred but what for our

782
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:24,579
example here you're making it your F

783
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:27,009
doing your varietal ah so when you make

784
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:28,569
that f2 a lot of times the f2 s are

785
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:30,970
better than the F ones but you're gonna

786
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:33,220
see variants you're gonna see something

787
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,990
that looks like Grandma something look

788
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,839
looks like grandpa and they'll be on

789
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,130
both sides of the trait chart so how can

790
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,470
I explain this a little better let's say

791
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,510
you've got a strain like I'm just gonna

792
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,210
invent something so you've got white

793
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:47,619
widow crossed to grateful dog which is

794
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,288
actually capable too and then on the

795
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:51,849
other side you've got a rise or a little

796
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:54,069
say golden go across the Daybreaker

797
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:56,740
which is a ride if you cross the arise

798
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:58,298
and the Capleton you will see traits of

799
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,399
all four of the grandparents you'll see

800
00:25:58,298 --> 00:26:03,220
white widow grateful dog golden go and

801
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:04,509
daybreak or representations in there but

802
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,679
sometimes that's a good thing

803
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:07,509
because some of those plants will

804
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,059
outperform the original parents you will

805
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:13,028
have created more robust faster growing

806
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:15,609
more resinous more desirable plants

807
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:16,960
you'll find better progeny and I think

808
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,028
the term for that is transgressive

809
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,288
segregation if anybody wants to google

810
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:22,509
and tell me if I'm right or wrong I

811
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,638
think the term transgressive segregation

812
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:27,970
is gonna have something about better

813
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:28,959
performing or extreme or turbo or

814
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,610
something like that something I'll say

815
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,278
turbo but it's gonna be something like

816
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:34,538
that that indicates transgressive

817
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:35,750
segregation and that I'm just indicating

818
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:37,789
that it outperform

819
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,880
it's parents is what I mean by the

820
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:42,889
transgressive segregation term here but

821
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,420
anyway you'll be making the next finial

822
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,820
generation which is which is always fun

823
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,620
too because you'll either be ah you'll

824
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:49,909
be stabilizing it or you'll be kind of

825
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:51,469
you'll find one that's way different

826
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,029
that you like better you'll have a lot

827
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,400
of fun with that and then you'll have

828
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,500
different phenotypes of seeds that you

829
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,120
created and this whole problem of having

830
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,890
to keep a whole bunch of strains around

831
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,739
is only going to compound itself once

832
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:06,080
you start making seeds trust me on that

833
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,160
that's how you get into plant hoarding

834
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,720
that's how you end up buying a warehouse

835
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,240
that's how you end up just going big and

836
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,130
ended up as a breeder and having tons of

837
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,420
[ __ ] good luck

838
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,830
also here's something that we should

839
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,240
talk about timing you're talking about

840
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:18,649
breeding timing is crucial when you're

841
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,940
breeding if you want to make seeds if

842
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,350
you want to make a lot of seeds if you

843
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,730
want to make it worth your time timing

844
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,259
is very important it's a good idea to

845
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,370
have the mail a little bit ahead of the

846
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:27,170
females if you've got the male and the

847
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:28,339
female if you start them flowering at

848
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,779
the same exact time next to each other

849
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:32,629
you'll get plenty of seeds if you want a

850
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:34,789
lot of seeds I suggest you let the male

851
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:38,210
flower get a fly flying in my face sorry

852
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:40,700
look I suggest you let the male flower

853
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,559
start him off 10 to 14 days early get

854
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,059
him flowering keep him away from the

855
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,399
girls then put the girls in the flower

856
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:48,289
ten to fourteen days after that uh you

857
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,600
will see the male starting to dump

858
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:52,579
pollen around day a fourteen Paula start

859
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:55,000
coming out pollen will really start

860
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:57,230
coming out of around day 25 around 8:30

861
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,619
your girl plants are going to want

862
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:04,730
pollen around day kind of depending on

863
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:07,369
the strain but around day 23 through 32

864
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,410
ish maybe 25 through 32 ish depending on

865
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:11,419
the strain and one thing I've noticed if

866
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,640
I'm breeding for Firefly I need to put

867
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,650
the lemon skunk plant into the flowering

868
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,210
room much earlier because it needs to

869
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,620
develop those tall buds and started

870
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,930
getting a lot of pistols on those tall

871
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:23,000
buds if I pollinate it too soon it quits

872
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,890
growing and I don't give it enough bud

873
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,900
sites to actually receive enough pollen

874
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,700
to make it worth of [ __ ] to breed too so

875
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,070
I put the lemon skunk plant in there a

876
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,930
little bit earlier then about four or

877
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:34,879
five days later I'll put Capleton in

878
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:39,170
there and then a few days later I will

879
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,760
put whatever Kalonji cush in there and

880
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,860
then I will pollinate them all at the

881
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:45,740
same time because they will all have

882
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:47,750
gotten to the right point is basically

883
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,609
what that is so timing is very crucial

884
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,778
when you're trying to breed

885
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:52,579
like I said if you just want to make a

886
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:54,739
few seeds for yourself put them in there

887
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:56,720
on the same day let it all happen

888
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:58,220
naturally or set that male plant in

889
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,110
another room collect the pollen you can

890
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,850
just set it on a ceramic plate or on a

891
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:03,199
mirror or you could just tap it every

892
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:04,788
couple of days and get some pollen out

893
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,019
of it until you've got enough to do what

894
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:08,179
you think you need to do it does not

895
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:10,368
take a lot of pollen to make plenty of

896
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:12,950
seeds you can make a lot of seeds with

897
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:14,628
one male plant just for a reference

898
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,999
point I'm not sure how much I should

899
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:18,918
talk about this but a plant in a beer

900
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:20,058
cup I can pull thirty to fifty seeds

901
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,590
from if done properly

902
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:23,239
oh also I should mention I forgot to

903
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:25,878
mention this I will pollinate twice

904
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:27,108
sometimes I'll hit the plants one time

905
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:28,548
and then I'll give them three to five

906
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:29,989
days and I will go back and read

907
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:31,339
pollinate just to make sure that I got

908
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:33,139
them sufficiently that's something I

909
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:34,819
forgot to mention I will go back now

910
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:37,219
what was I saying okay I can get about

911
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:39,950
thirty to fifty seeds from a plant in a

912
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,259
beer cup in a three gallon pot a plant

913
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,269
that I grow about a foot maybe two feet

914
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:46,190
tall before I flower it it ends up about

915
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:49,128
three three and a half feet tall usually

916
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:52,308
depending on the strain you guys I will

917
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:54,829
get five hundred to a thousand seeds out

918
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:56,058
of a plant like that so you only have if

919
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:57,528
you're making seeds for yourself you

920
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:59,118
only have to do that once and then

921
00:29:57,528 --> 00:30:01,099
you've got a thousand seeds to work with

922
00:29:59,118 --> 00:30:02,689
and that should last you a long time

923
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:05,658
unless you're running huge numbers which

924
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,538
is ridiculous but imagine how many

925
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:09,919
plants under that you can fit nine of

926
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:12,138
those three gallon pots under a light

927
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,850
comfortably maybe 12 if you cram them in

928
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:15,108
there maybe 16 if you really [ __ ]

929
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:17,868
force them in but I don't like to do

930
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:20,148
that I usually do about nine three

931
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:22,398
gallon pots and then or maybe nine five

932
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:23,928
gallon pots and then just around the

933
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:25,788
outer edge there I do a couple of cups

934
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:27,619
just for experiments so no making

935
00:30:25,788 --> 00:30:28,940
commercial seed that's how that's how

936
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:31,278
that works per a thousand watt light I

937
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,808
got about nine plants probably get 500

938
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:33,888
seeds on average a thousand the

939
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:35,509
redheaded stranger will give me a

940
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:38,148
thousand seeds that plant just makes a

941
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:40,579
bunch of heads Kalonji push on the other

942
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:42,979
hand I'll get closer to 500 just kind of

943
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:43,759
depends on on the strain anyway I don't

944
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,190
know how much of that I should be

945
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,999
talking about so don't tell anybody I

946
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,798
hope I answered your question about

947
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:50,798
making seeds for yourself it is not as

948
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,999
hard or as scary as it sounds you guys

949
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,499
people get really intimidated when it

950
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:56,089
comes to male plants and breeding and

951
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:58,159
stuff like that but it's nature it's

952
00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:00,798
really easy to do the hardest part is

953
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,210
not pollinating stuff on accident and

954
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:03,279
something super important to think about

955
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,230
is don't go to the gross

956
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,519
or don't go to the dispensary don't go

957
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,680
around any of your friends that grow

958
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:09,789
don't go to anybody's grow if you work

959
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,920
at a grouse stay the [ __ ] away from

960
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:14,799
there until you have completely showered

961
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,150
changed your clothes gotten totally wet

962
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,519
because you need to deactivate all of

963
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,019
that pollen be careful there'll be that

964
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,539
guy that goes and pollinates everybody's

965
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:24,789
garden on accident all right you guys

966
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:26,289
haven't known for 30 just over 31

967
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:27,970
minutes here and I haven't taken much of

968
