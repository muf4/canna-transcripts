00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,060
these episodes off by letting you know

31
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,368
what I've been smoking on all day

32
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,250
instead I'm gonna tell you what I wish I

33
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:13,319
was smoking on on Sunday I stopped at a

34
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,968
dispensary in Colorado Springs called a

35
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,048
cut above it was a medical dispensary

36
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:20,669
they had about 75 ish concentrates on

37
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,049
the shelf to offer they also had some of

38
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,379
the best flowers I've seen in a long

39
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,820
time

40
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,608
but what I was there for was

41
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,428
concentrates I'm not joking there were

42
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:32,158
probably 75 quality concentrates to look

43
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:33,960
through before I made my decision I was

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,939
about halfway through and I stumbled

45
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,858
across something called Starchild og

46
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,809
I've done an episode called follow your

47
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:41,339
nose talking about whatever jumps out at

48
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,590
your nose is probably gonna probably

49
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,270
gonna be good medicine for you I smelled

50
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,579
this starchild OG and something in my

51
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,170
brain my nose and my body said Rasta

52
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,298
Jeff just buy this there's no need to

53
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,710
look any further I said a gram of that

54
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,240
aside of course I'm stubborn I looked

55
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,428
further and I found some of this super

56
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,718
sour lemon live resin from olio it

57
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:01,350
smells and tastes amazing but this

58
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:03,629
Starchild it had this Durbin poison Jack

59
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,379
Herer super Lemon Haze kind of a flavor

60
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,728
going on to it and an aroma and it was

61
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:10,439
saucy it was high cannabinoid full

62
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,140
spectrum extract crystals floating

63
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,120
around in high cannabinoid full or high

64
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,419
terpene full-spectrum extract Terps

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
so it was crystals and

66
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:20,019
just floating around and a tiny jar

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,599
together and the aroma just kept

68
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,069
punching me in the face

69
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,500
unfortunately it disappeared very

70
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:29,109
quickly I smoked that gram Sunday with

71
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,879
keV Kevin and I destroyed that gram we

72
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,590
enjoyed it but it disappeared very

73
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,900
quickly so I've been thinking about it

74
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,430
wishing I had more I came home today I

75
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,629
was gonna take some dabs after work and

76
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,400
I picked up my dad rig and it was a

77
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:40,750
little mucky I was like maybe I should

78
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,950
rinse that thing out so I wouldn't took

79
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,129
it to the sink and ran some hot water

80
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:48,189
through it as soon as that hot water hit

81
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:51,189
my rig I could smell that dryer sheett

82
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:53,318
Turpin alene Jack Herer Durbin poison

83
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:55,780
smell throughout the entire kitchen area

84
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:58,030
it was overwhelmingly perfectly amazing

85
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,469
it was like some sort of aromatherapy

86
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,299
candle had been lit like somebody had

87
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:03,609
some potpourri or somebody sprayed one

88
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:06,280
of those little things in the room it

89
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,590
smelled so good it made my mouth drool

90
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,689
it made me wish I had more of those dabs

91
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,159
so the Starchild oh gee that's what I

92
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:14,109
wish I was dabbing on right now that

93
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,818
stuff was amazing somebody told me it

94
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,620
was actually snow Lotus from Bodhi I'm

95
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:19,659
not sure if that's accurate whatever it

96
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,759
was shot it to a cut above that was some

97
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,829
delicious extract the high was amazing

98
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,449
the color the consistency the flavor the

99
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,489
aroma beautiful concentrates

100
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:29,560
unfortunately I bought the very last

101
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,959
gram that they had when I was there so

102
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,449
unless they've got more next time that

103
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,609
was my last shot at bat so the Starchild

104
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:37,988
og was delicious wish I had more the

105
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:39,820
kitchen smells like it right now even

106
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,890
though I don't have any I do have a nice

107
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,930
clean rig and I've been dabbing since I

108
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:47,199
cleaned the rig I've been taking dabs of

109
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,260
the pre 98 bubba kush ambrosia batter

110
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,209
from apothecary it has got sort of a and

111
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:54,489
I know I say this a lot earthy coffee

112
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:58,840
cushy sort of a smell to it plus a hint

113
00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:01,120
of chocolate so it's earthy cushy coffee

114
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,750
chocolate maybe with a little like a

115
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,920
sweet thing in there also the pre 98

116
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,919
bubba kush I'm smelling it again

117
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:15,009
I think I described it accurately earth

118
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,259
coffee chocolate and cush so I'm dabbing

119
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:19,000
the pre 98 Bubba cush batter I'm getting

120
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:20,978
decent-sized dabs of the batter and

121
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,959
putting it on the dabber then I'm

122
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,668
getting some bobblehead high cannabinoid

123
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,399
full-spectrum extract crystals and

124
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:28,750
dunking that batter into the crystals to

125
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,489
pick it up like salt and pepper on my

126
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,889
dab so I got a little bobble head

127
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,519
crystals on the dab and the bobble head

128
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:38,829
is 398 bubba kush and headband ran

129
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,439
together so those are pretty nice dabs

130
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:45,399
lots of flavor from the batter the

131
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:47,199
bobblehead concentrate is 98% total

132
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,879
cannabinoids so I'm getting a lot of THC

133
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,319
in my brain when I take a dab of that

134
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,079
I'm getting a lot of cannabinoids a lot

135
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,779
of flavor and the batter gives me this

136
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,668
nice long punch that I really enjoy so

137
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:59,559
super great dabs today I'm glad I clean

138
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:01,538
the rig that's what I'm smoking on

139
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,850
thanks for joining me let's move forward

140
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:08,889
with a podcast ladies and gentlemen

141
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,500
Saturday night I got to go see Chris

142
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:14,560
Hardwick at Comedy Works in downtown

143
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Denver and holy [ __ ] what a fun show I

144
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,288
had a great time let's start from the

145
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,939
beginning April Richardson the host and

146
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:25,379
producer well not the host the producer

147
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:27,098
of The Nerdist now known as the identity

148
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,500
podcast I remember how to say it

149
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:31,360
identity i Nerdist changed the name of

150
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,029
all their stuff but anyway Chris

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,889
Hardwick changed the name of his podcast

152
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:38,168
listen to it he'll tell you why anyway

153
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,689
April Richardson opened she was pretty

154
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:42,759
funny ah she makes fun of herself a lot

155
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:44,168
she's a very unique looking woman so she

156
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,829
uses that to her advantage

157
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:50,109
miss Jenny Beth was my date for the show

158
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:51,879
the the comedian April Richardson was

159
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,650
from Georgia Jenny Beth is from Georgia

160
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,879
they had a connection that was fun of

161
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:56,679
course we were sitting up front so when

162
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,180
the comedian comedian I think that's

163
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,470
what you call a lady comedian when she

164
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,300
said she was from Georgia

165
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,500
Jenny screamed like woohoo cuz they're

166
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,240
both from Georgia and now they made

167
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,918
friends it was pretty cool to have her

168
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,269
kind of come perform right in front of

169
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,089
Jenny for a few minutes so that was a

170
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:12,909
good time then Miss April Richardson

171
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:14,709
brought out a guy by the name of Mike

172
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,419
Fuhrman and I knew Mike Furman would be

173
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:18,759
there because I saw a guitar on stage

174
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:20,620
when we walked in that was a huge hint

175
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,418
that mike phirman would be there mike

176
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,718
phirman is one of Chris Hardwick's best

177
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,609
for

178
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:26,468
from a long time ago they go way back

179
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,179
they used to be in a group called hard

180
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:29,709
and firm together that's right chris

181

hardwick mike phirman they made a group

182
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:36,819
called hard and firm where they would

183
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:39,338
sing really good shitty songs yes I said

184
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:41,079
really good shitty songs musical comedy

185
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:44,999
is always terrible unless you're in the

186
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:47,679
mood for it unless it's hard and firm or

187
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:49,088
maybe wheeler Walker but usually it's

188
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:50,378
not good right but these guys pull it

189
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:54,368
off they're cheesy white guys and they

190
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:56,979
nail it so ah Fuhrman comes out and does

191
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:58,149
quite a bit of good material quite a bit

192
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:59,889
I don't wanna ruin any of it because it

193
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:02,019
was all great go see it if they're

194

196
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:06,519

198
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:11,800
so mike phirman does a a nice set then

199
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:13,718
he of course brings out the legend Chris

200
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,149
Hardwick Chris Hardwick comes out and

201
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:18,308
did I don't know he must have done a

202
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:20,649
solid hour hour in ten minutes and he

203
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:23,409
killed the entire hour in ten minutes he

204
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:25,178
uh so he asked the people on stage on

205
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,709
that side he was just having he does a

206
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,818
lot of crowd work he interacts with the

207
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,959
audience quite a bit so he asked the

208
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,098
people over there he's like hey what do

209

210
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:32,978
I'm a geologist and he's like cool and

211
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,968
he made rock jokes and he asked the next

212
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:35,889
person what do you do for work and the

213
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:37,748
person sitting next to that person said

214
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,550
we're all three geologists so all three

215
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,929
people in that row are geologist Chris

216
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,129
Hardwick is like dammit Denver you're

217
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,628
allowed to hang out with other people

218
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,610
then he walks to the other side of the

219
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,019
stage and he's gonna interview people

220
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,129
over there and he's like sir what do you

221
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:50,079
do for work and the guys like I'm a

222
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:51,369
project manager and he's like sounds

223
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,610
good are you sure you're not a geologist

224
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:56,349
hahaha and then he asks that man's date

225
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,300
what do you do for work and she laughs

226
00:07:56,348 --> 00:08:00,699
really hard and turns red and says I'm a

227
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,408
project manager so on one side of the

228
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,088
stage we've got geologists on the other

229
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:05,829
side of the stage project managers and

230
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:07,149
Hardwick is saying to himself damn it

231
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:09,009
down or not to himself out loud

232
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,319
damnit Denver date other people you

233
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,149
don't have to stay in your box then he

234
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,889
looks at me and he smiles and he says

235
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:17,499
you and he sticks the mic in my face and

236
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:20,079
he says what do you do for work sir and

237
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:21,939
I proudly said I am in the cannabis

238
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,679
industry and I said it just like that

239
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,088
you guys I didn't embarrass the cannabis

240
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:26,588
industry I didn't embarrass myself I

241
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,968
didn't say a girl weed bro

242
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:29,168
cuz everybody knows that when they look

243
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:30,788
at me I got dreadlocks red eyes a

244
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:33,668
crooked grass roots hats and a veg blue

245
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:35,828
t-shirt I grow weed I tried to say it

246
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:36,579
professionally and I said I am in the

247
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,408
cannabis industry

248
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,269
and he goes yeah no [ __ ] I could

249
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:41,528
probably tell right he made a couple of

250
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,120
jokes and he walked around the stage and

251
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:45,370
goes on about it for a few minutes then

252
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,610
he makes a joke about how the geologists

253
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,810
the project managers and myself should

254
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,889
get together and start a business right

255
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,119
because we got the guy that breaks up

256
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,559
the rocks and the guy that grows the

257
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,179
dope and the guy that does the project

258
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,500
managing and the hard work made some

259
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,609
jokes on that then he came back to miss

260
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,339
Jenny Beth because she was sitting next

261
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,079
to me and said ma'am what do you do for

262
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,300
work and of course Jenny Beth told the

263
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:06,549
truth she said I am in the cannabis

264
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:08,349
industry and the crowd and Hardwick went

265
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:11,169
[ __ ] wild I thought it was pretty

266
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,220

267
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:14,349

268
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,209
walked away then we were on a date I

269
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,290

270
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,179

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,190
like improv comedy and then at the end

328
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:04,659
I'm not gonna ruin it I'm not gonna tell

329
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,540
you what it was about or what they said

330
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,289
or anything but they sing a song

331
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:11,259
together

332
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:12,899
it was very very unique there was a

333
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:17,740
video in the background that matched

334
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:19,240
their theatrics were beautiful I thought

335
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,570
I was gonna break something laughing so

336
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,330
hard

337
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,650
and it was [ __ ] hilarious so you guys

338
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,210
go see Chris Hardwick

339
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,429

the show all right I saw Chris Hardwick

344
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,660
it was fun you guys I had to brag on the

345
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:42,730
podcast come see a comedy show with me

346
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:44,740
all right um really quickly let's talk

347
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,279
about something that somebody asked me

348
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,009
on Instagram live I do Instagram live

349
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,509
videos where I will answer cannabis grow

350
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:54,100
questions I'll answer all kinds of weird

351
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,720
questions we talked about all kinds of

352
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,909
random [ __ ] on my Instagram live videos

353
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,480
so join me on there I'm Irie underscore

354
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:03,189
genetics on Instagram I read genetics so

355
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,050
somebody asked me was actually Banksy

356
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,660
Jesse asked me to explain the difference

357
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:10,209
between f2 and BX

358
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:14,620
no I thought of a really easy way to

359
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:16,870
explain this f2 so let's say you take

360
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,240
let's just pick a strain we're gonna say

361
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,879
a rise so you've got a rise you've got a

362
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,389
handful of a rise seeds you making a

363
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:26,799
rise male and you making a rise female

364
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:28,960
now let's back up a step I'm gonna

365
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,909
correct myself and back up a step let's

366
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,040
say you're certain that these seeds are

367
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:34,799
F once that you're arise seeds are f1

368
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,230
this is the only way that this works

369
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,329
well for my example these are rice seeds

370
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,860
or F once I made the seeds I gave them

371
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,900
to you you've got seeds that you know

372
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,300
are f1 okay so you've got a no rise f1

373
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:48,850
you find a male and a female that is f1

374
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,979
when I cross Daybreaker to golden goat

375
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,320
Daybreaker and golden go I cross them

376
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,269
they made new seeds that's an f1 okay

377
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,160
that's a rise that's the f1 you got some

378
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,980
of those from me then he found a male

379
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,240
and a female that's a male f1 and a

380
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,870
female f1 okay

381
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,740
if you cross those

382
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,870
you make f2 okay if you cross from the

383
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,250
same handful of seeds if you cross the

384
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:16,259
male and female from the same batch

385
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,309
batch ah filial generation you are now

386
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,439
making F twos

387
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:22,019
filial generation F 2 and if you take a

388
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,279
handful of F twos and you cross those

389
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,169
together a male and a female you're

390
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,649
making F 3 and so forth but they have to

391
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:30,299
come from so the male-female F 1

392
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,949
pollinate each other they make this

393
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,750
handful of seats you take these handful

394
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,640
of seeds you find males and females you

395
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,990
breed them together you make F threes

396
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,490
those seeds that come up you breed them

397
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:45,629
together you make F fours now so a B X

398
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:48,509
would be if I took the arise F 1 seeds

399
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,820
that I have and bred them back to either

400
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:54,120
the golden goat or the Daybreaker that

401
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:57,120
would be a B X so in the most disgusting

402
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,460
terms to say it F 2 s our brother and

403
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,409
sister [ __ ] F threes or brother and

404
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,450
sister [ __ ] continuing continuing

405
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:06,689
filial generations our brother and

406
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,730
sister [ __ ] B Xing is parent [ __ ]

407
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,020
okay that's [ __ ] disgusting to think

408
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,250
about it that way but now the idea is

409
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,990
clear in your head and there's no

410
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:17,899
confusion on what the difference between

411
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:21,210
an F or a B exit so if you want to make

412
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:23,338
filial generations forward you just keep

413
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,019
using batches of the same seed that come

414
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,339
out of use so you got your male and

415
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,259
female you breed them I like this little

416
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,450
thing where you make more seeds you put

417
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,620
the male and female together again you

418
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,750
make more seeds you just keep going

419
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,049
forward and the reason to do that is to

420
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,429
stabilize across with a rise I would

421
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:40,199
like to get them all into that one

422
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:42,659
phenotype that is real squat it grows

423
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,060
that one squatty bushy phenotype with

424
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,500
the giant Cola it's got a lot of resin

425
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,549
on it and it kind of smells like gassy

426
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,320
ice cream and I know that's a really

427
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:51,149
weird description but it's like it's got

428
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,570
a smoothness to it and a gas to it at

429
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:56,250
the same time so I'm gonna find and I've

430
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,660
done a couple generations I just don't

431
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,120
release a lot of things yet I keep some

432
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:02,100
things to myself you got to find the f1

433
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,839
it looks like what you want it to be and

434
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,220
find another male it looks like what you

435
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,570
want it to be and breed those and then

436
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,509
you'll make the f2 s and then find the

437
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,040
f2 that grows like you want it to be and

438
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,720
then find the male that looks like you

439
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,610
wanted to be and breed those and then

440
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,230
every time you go you should get it

441
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,769
closer and closer to making clones

442
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,019
basically when you grow from

443
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:22,028
by the time you get to f4 or f5 you're

444
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,860
gonna be growing basically clones from

445
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:25,958
CDO throw out ten seeds and they're all

446
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,149
gonna look very similar very similar

447
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:30,219
almost clone like so that's why you

448
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:31,869
would want to move forward with a filial

449
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,839
generation with brother and sister

450
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:37,959
[ __ ] now why would you want to do ABX

451
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,499
that's a really good question here's a

452
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:43,568
really good example golden goat is a

453
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:45,610
clone only stream there is no male of

454
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,588
golden goat in existence the person that

455
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,419
made that put out the best golden goat

456
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,799
got rid of the rest of it honestly I

457
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:52,928
don't know what he did but that's never

458
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:54,428
been released nobody's got access to a

459
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:56,230
male golden goat other than the guy that

460
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:58,149
made golden goat whose name is mr. dink

461
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,739
a lot of people like to think I did that

462
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:02,589
that was not my creation a guy named mr.

463
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:04,569
dink did that so there's no male golden

464
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:06,939
go but perhaps a lot of people would

465
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:08,378
like golden goat seeds I know they would

466
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:08,860
because they asked me for it all the

467
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:11,139
time

468
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,789
what's the best way to get some golden

469
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,528
goat seeds without [ __ ] up gold and

470
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:17,198
go too much you would have to take a

471
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:20,860
golden go female and pollinate it with a

472
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:23,558
male plant that is not golden goat so

473
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,360
now perhaps I did that with day breaker

474
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:27,428
and I made a rise alright so I've got a

475
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,808
golden goat today breaker which wouldn't

476
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:29,528
have been the best idea my intention

477
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:31,028
here wasn't me

478
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:33,639
to make a bx but this is just a good

479
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:36,159
example golden goat today breaker made a

480
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:39,159
rise now if I wanted to get golden goat

481
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:42,068
closer to golden goat seeds I would take

482
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:44,048
a male a rise that looked a lot like

483
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,909
golden goat that had those long skinny

484
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:48,068
shitty leaves and then I would put that

485
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:50,528
pollen on the female gold and go and now

486
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:52,448
I have just back crossed it and the

487
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:56,100
reason I'd want to do that is now I'm

488
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:58,269
going to make seeds that have two so

489
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,980
there's golden goat right here that I

490
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:01,509
just pollinated plus there's golden goat

491
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,009
and Daybreaker and this other one so now

492
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:04,328
there's two chances of getting two out

493
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:04,870
of three chances getting golden goat

494
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:06,818
style

495
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,269
dominant phenotypes I'm gonna see a lot

496
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:11,109
of golden goat rates out of that 66%

497
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:15,638
hypothetically hopefully if I do it

498
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:17,438
right hopefully about 66% so then I

499
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:19,838
would grow those and out of that batch

500
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,179
of seeds I would find the best-looking

501
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,428
male the one that looked like the golden

502
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:25,778
goat male closest to gold and go and I

503
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,059
would use that and I would reap all

504
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:31,299
innate that gold and go female and those

505
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:33,430
seeds are gonna be very close to

506
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,200
so that's why you would do a BX you're

507
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,330
trying to make a strain that is clone

508
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,069
only into a seed form people say

509
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:41,679
couldn't you just reverse it and make

510
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:43,990
feminized seeds yes you could but a lot

511
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,019
of people do not want feminized seeds

512
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:50,950
they would rather have a B X so that is

513
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:54,250
the difference between making f2 f3 f4

514
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,410
is and so forth versus back crossing

515
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,059
your genetics I hope I taught that

516
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,740
correctly I hope you learned something I

517
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,309
hope you had a lot of fun with me ladies

mac book patreon didn't completely cover

597
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,110
that that was a little bit of Ross to

598
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,179
Jeff but patreon helped out tremendously

599
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,649
and made it possible if you'd like to

600
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,350
help me cover the entire cost of the mac

601
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:55,298
