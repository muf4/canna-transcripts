Comedy Works uh Joe list kind of

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,280
downplays his comedy he doesn't talk

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,200
about how many tickets he sells about

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,939
how many people show up to his show he's

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,140
kind of self-deprecating and then when

30
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,000
you show up to the comedy show you

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,159

blown away by the cool [ __ ] you've never

165
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,978
seen I also sneak in some testers and

166
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,240
freebies and all of those but yes

167
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:47,099
occasionally I do throw out those

168
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,660
bundles and since you've got faith in me

169
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,520
and trust me just to load it up for you

170
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,960
that's why I really hook you up with

171
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,180
those anyway I should keep moving it

172
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,680
says the new packaging is awesome and in

173
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,199
a weird way it's seemed like you knew

174
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,699
what I want or what I don't have or what

175
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,079
I wanted to buy and eat through that in

176
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,879
there so thanks again there's a lot of

177
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,379
cool compliments in there the new

178
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,300
packaging thank you if you guys have not

179
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,060
seen the new packaging from ire genetics

180
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,100
uh I redirect grab some seeds there's a

181
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,199
good chance that uh the John lemons will

182
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,580
come in the new packaging uh the big

183
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,379
mountain fudge cake will definitely be

184
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,719
in the new packaging and then some of

185
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,000
the Femmes have their own custom package

186
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,860
designs on there so grab some seeds it

187
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,360
goes on any way it says on to my grow

188
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,280
question that is the point of this right

189
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,379
do you have any tips on keeping a grow

190
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,299
room warmer in the winter that's a

191
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,159
really good question I'm sure if you've

192
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,379
been following along you know that when

193
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,620
I switch from LED lighting I went from

194
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:40,319
HBS to LED lighting it kind of ruined a

195
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,819
whole entire crop I stupidly it was my

196
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,979
decision my move I did that in the

197
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,900
middle of the winter it was negative 17

198
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:48,899
degrees outside and I decided to take

199
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,519
down the HBS lights and hang up LEDs and

200
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,978
guess what that room got super [ __ ]

201
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,258
cold because I was relying on those HPS

202
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,240
lights to keep that room warm and it did

203
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,280
not work with the LEDs the LEDs put off

204
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,500
basically no heat compared to what to

205
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,899
compared to what the HPS lights were

206
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,639
doing so I have struggled with this

207
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,159
before I do need to keep that grow room

208
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,478
that grow space warm my solution and you

209
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,639
said you can't do that or don't want to

210
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,740
do that but my solution was to hang more

211
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,840
lights I just put the HBS light back up

212
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,519
so the LEDs are where they should be in

213
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,019
their area and then I just put HBS up

214
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,459
over on the side and that's what's

215
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,379
heating up the room now it's basically

216
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,359
working as extra light and as a heater

217
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,538
all right it does go on it says my wife

218
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,680
and I recently purchased a new home

219
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:31,139
congratulations brother that is a big

220
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,240
thing especially at this time it goes on

221
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,918
it says and in this home my new grow

222
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,418
will be in the basement that's that's

223
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,758
perfect we all started in the basement

224
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:41,219
abroads where most of us start it says

225
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,319
she is always hot and I am always cold

226
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,319
so we compromise and just keep the house

227
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,180
cold that makes sense uh it was 58

228
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,340
degrees in there yesterday morning that

229
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,259
is kind of cold for a grow space it says

230
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,000
the room isn't huge it's about 110

231
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,300
square feet so that's about a like a 10

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,639
by 11 room I also don't do not own HPS

233
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,340
or ceramic metal halide fixtures anymore

234
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,500
I'm hesitant to use a standard hot coil

235
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,478
space heater due to fire risks I have

236
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,098
some ideas but this is another one of

237
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,318
those what would Rasta Jeff do

238
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:13,139
situations from our friend and they call

239
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,300
themselves f a plant count I like that F

240
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,280
that plant count although I do strictly

241
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,139
follow the plant count here in Colorado

242
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,000
because of all of the rules but I know

243
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,500
what you mean have a plant count so that

244
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,139
is a great question how do we keep a

245
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,060
basement grow space warm in the winter I

246
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,160
did write down a few ideas of course my

247
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,839
first option would be just to get a safe

248
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,019
heater I know you don't want one of

249
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,639
those uh dangerous space heaters but you

250
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,740
can get a quality heater now it's uh

251
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,958
it's 2020 three it's not the 80s it's

252
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,399
not the 70s anymore or those heaters are

253
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,199
super dangerous there are quality

254
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,759
heaters available you can buy an

255
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,800
industrial heater or a residential

256
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,360
heater you can set it on the floor in a

257
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,979
safe spot or you can put it up on the

258
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,399
ceiling in a safe spot you can mount it

259
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,600
make sure you follow all of the

260
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,980
manufacturers recommended rolls and

261
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,659
safety precautions I got to say that to

262
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,920
keep myself out of trouble and

263
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:00,299
everything you do is your responsibility

264
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,559
and your fall so I should say that just

265
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:03,479
to keep that's for just for legal

266
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:05,939
purposes here but I would recommend just

267
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,980
a normal small heater it's a 110 square

268
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,480
feet room a very small heater should be

269
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,800
able to warm that space you can run that

270
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,180
heater when the lights are on you can

271
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,159
run that heater when the lights are off

272
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,139
that is one option I would get a heater

273
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,639
and something called a cap switch let's

274
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,019
talk about what a cap switch is many

275
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,000
people aren't familiar with these types

276
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,740
of devices they're great uh great

277
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,879
devices they make them for all kinds of

278
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,440
different things that do you can figure

279
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,080
out how to do you can operate a whole

280
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
grow room huh you could automate an

281
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,540
entire room with just a few cap switches

282
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,360
if you really think about what you're

283
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:35,579
doing so a cap switch the switch plugs

284
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,019
into the wall where the plug-in goes so

285
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,300
the first step is to get the cap switch

286
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,639
plug it into the wall it's got a

287
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:42,958
thermostat on it so you turn it to the

288
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,819
range that you want I think it'll be

289
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,278
within three to five degrees so you're

290
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,320
going to get like 70 to 75 turn it there

291
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,899
70 to 75 degrees maybe a little hotter

292
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,278
72 to 77 maybe a little hotter depends

293
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,839
on what you want to do

294
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,580
uh but turn it to where you want it set

295
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,740
it on the range at which you want it

296
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,440
then you plug the heater into that cap

297
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,419
switch then you turn the heater knob to

298
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,100
where it's on at medium or high however

299
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,479
much however much intensity you want

300
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,399
that heater to bang out maybe if you put

301
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,720
it on medium it won't be banging at high

302
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,639
intensity all the time it may last

303
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,740
longer less risk a problem less risk of

304
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,600
fire so you turn the heater on medium

305
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,980
it's got one of those manual uh those

306
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,360
switches that you have to turn don't get

307
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,220
a digital heater because that will not

308
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,019
work with your cap switch you got to get

309
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,240
the analog kind with the knobs that you

310
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,220
can turn so get the turning off turn it

311
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,100
on to medium get that [ __ ] going plug

312
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,420
it into the cap switch then there's a a

313
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,639
cord that comes from the cap switch

314
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,799
that's got a thermometer on it hang that

315
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,379
in the middle of the room maybe right

316
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,819
above canopy High then that thermometer

317
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:40,740
will hang right above the canopy and

318
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,778
whenever it gets too high or too low for

319
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,000
that temperature if it's too low if it's

320
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,740
under 75 degrees that'll say hey it's

321
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,899
under 75 degrees and it will turn on

322
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,639
power to that switch which will turn on

323
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,019
the heater the heater will heat up as

324
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,039
the room heats up that thermometer

325
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,839
hanging in the middle of the room will

326
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,399
say hey okay it's as hot as we need it

327
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,680
to be and it'll tell that switch hey

328
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,179
turn off the power to this this plug-in

329
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,919
right here so all you're doing is

330
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,659
turning off and on the power to that

331
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,159
plug-in by using a thermometer it'll say

332
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:06,719
I'm within the ranger I'm not within the

333
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,399
range and if you've got a heater that's

334
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,100
got a switch on it that you can turn off

335
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,860
on medium high low however that will

336
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,540
work but a digital uh heater will not

337
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,120
work for this situation you can also do

338
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:19,500
the opposite with an air conditioner if

339
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,659
you do a cap switch on an air

340
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,399
conditioner set it low set it high you

341
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,139
can tell that air conditioner come on

342
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,700
you can put as many devices on as many

343
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,439
cap switches as you want in the room

344
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,240
they sell them for humidity with a

345
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,100
humidistat on there they sell them for

346
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,720
heaters they sell them for coolers you

347
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,579
can automate all kinds of things with

348
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,379
cap switches so think about those things

349
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,179
a little bit I do have some notes that I

350
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:40,559
completely abandon here

351
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,519
um so the cap switch is your first

352
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,739
choice

353
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,060
a heater is your first choice heater

354
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,180
with a cap switch is your next choice

355
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:50,399
then um if you've got two rooms this is

356
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:52,139
what I've done before I've got a a

357
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,839
bedroom and a flower room next to each

358
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,639
other I simply vent the heat from the

359
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,500
bedroom into the flower room and the

360
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,600
flower room is dark so at night it's

361
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,220
just heating up that room using uh the

362
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,959
hot air so it's just venting that I'm

363
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,879
venting that hot air from the veg room

364
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,259
over there to the flower room wall to

365
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,600
sleep and that will help keep that room

366
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,278
warm a little bit and then that's got a

367
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,720
carbon filter and a dehumidifier in the

368
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,278
flower room so it'll clean that air up a

369
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,600
little bit and then send that out of the

370
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,419
room and it's just replacing there

371
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,339
constantly but invent that uh the veg

372
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,500
room heat into the flower room may be

373
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,260
another idea here's another thing you

374
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,000
can think about is flip the schedule I

375
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:29,338
know that may sound crazy but we do this

376
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,899
in the summer to keep the rooms cool why

377
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,180
not do this in the winter to keep the

378
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,339
rooms warm it's always going to be a

379
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:37,859
little bit warmer during the day maybe

380
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,300
only just a few degrees especially right

381
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,159
now it's snowing like a [ __ ]

382
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,838
outside in Colorado but it's only going

383
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,338
to be a few degrees but during the day

384
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,839
we're going to get a few degrees warmer

385
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,940
at night it's going to be a few degrees

386
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,500
colder what if you put your lights on

387
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,959
during the night to try to keep that

388
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,179
part of the cycle a little bit warmer

389
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,039
that may help you out that may keep

390
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,679
things dead even which may help you out

391
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,299
just a little bit a CO2 burner maybe

392
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,219
have you thought about adding a CO2

393
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,778
burner CO2 burner has a lot of good

394
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,959
benefits it's going to make your plants

395
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:09,299
grow bigger faster more robust it'll

396
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,799
help you use more nutrients you can use

397
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:12,778
a little bit warmer room in the

398
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,059
summertime but in the winter that CO2

399
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:16,980
burner will heat up the grow room it

400
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,539
hooks up to the Natural Gas it works

401
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,800
like a pilot light except it's like

402
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,120
multiple pilot lights in a room

403
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,919
depending on how big you buy you don't

404
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,839
need a big one for this room but you

405
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,000
could just use that CO2 burner it will

406
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,740
burn the CO2 and at the same time it

407
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,019
will heat up the room I know that's if

408
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,299
you're gonna do that do a heater but why

409
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,519
not a CO2 burner it's going to be just

410
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,559
as effective and if there's just as many

411
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,078
if not less risks it's probably equal

412
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,399
anyway here we go since I said risks let

413
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,219
me get to the next part of my notes it's

414
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,839
says smoke alarm and fire extinguisher

415
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,820
if you're going to use a heater if

416
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,160
you're going to use a CO2 burner I

417
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,980
highly highly recommend that you do add

418
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,120
a smoke alarm and a fire extinguisher if

419
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,278
you don't already have that in the grow

420
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,860
space you guys every grow space should

421
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:00,838
have a fire extinguisher available and

422
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,060
possibly a smoke detector either inside

423
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,920
or outside of that grow space put the

424
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:06,419
fire extinguisher outside of the grow

425
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,399
space if you have a grow space where the

426
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:10,139
door closes have the fire extinguisher

427
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,700
outside because if a fire does happen in

428
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,019
there you don't have to go in there to

429
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,399
get the fire extinguisher to put it out

430
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,139
you want to be able to kick the door

431
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,179
open and careful the doorknob may be hot

432
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:21,000
we've all seen the movie Backdraft but

433
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:23,039
open the door start spraying be prepared

434
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,480
so have that fire extinguisher and that

435
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,620
smoke alarm all right let me check on

436
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,539
the notes make sure I didn't miss

437
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,980
anything all right it looks like I

438
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:31,019
covered all of the notes for this

439
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,700
question my friend F of plant count

another message here on the table that I

450
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:52,319
would like to read this one came from my

451
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,420
friend shoe trader101 on patreon and it

452
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,220
goes a little bit like this it says rust

453
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:58,740
to Jeff I'm not sure how this happened

454
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,959
but uh from my last run to this run I

455
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,419
noticed a lack of smell coming from the

456
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,399
plants during the flowering stage I'm

457
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,500
not sure what causes this my very first

458
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,179
run was successful with all the smell

459
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,698
and everything you could possibly think

460
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:14,578
of I haven't changed anything I still

461
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:16,979
use build a soil 3.0 along with insect

462
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,599
frass build a flower and other items

463
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,399
that you can purchase directly from

464
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,379
build a soil per their recommendation

465
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,519
big up to build the soil they don't pay

466
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,139
me they don't sponsor the show I

467
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,060
honestly don't use them but all of the

468
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,698

business with them but big shout out to

477
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,779

480
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,579
regenerative guy what are the guys that

481

recommend building soil to those kind of

486
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,639
folks all the time

487
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,199
um so you're using a lot of build the

488
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,299
soil products and most of the stuff per

489
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,679
their recommendation it says a lot of

490
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,198
people would say that this is due that

491
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,899
the lack of smell is due to genetics but

492
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:13,139
I have your stuff lit Farms raw genetics

493
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,339
exotic genetics soulfire Top Dog and

494
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,320
more bro those are some of the best

495
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,000
breeders on the planet in my opinion to

496
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,399
hit some of my favorites in there so

497
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,500
it's definitely not a genetics issue and

498
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,659
your last run was good so it says any

499
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,419
feedback would help I'm in three uh five

500
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:30,838
gallon pots and one seven gallon pot and

501
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:33,000
I do pH my water all right so our friend

502
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,519
shoe Trader 101 from Instagram is having

503
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,198
a problem or their last run smelled

504
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,600
delicious everything was perfect but

505
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,219
this run does not have any Aroma and

506
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,379
flavor we're gonna try to diagnose and

507
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,879
figure figure out why with honestly the

508
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,399
little bit of information I've got here

509
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,778
I don't know the uh the uh the VPD I

510
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,458
don't know the lighting I don't know a

511
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:52,620
lot about this other than some Builder

512
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,479
soil products so let's uh let's dig into

513
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,060
some of my ideas

514
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,220
I started off by talking about uh temp

515
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,559
and humidity VPD how is the temp in

516
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,839
humidity in your grow space uh we all

517
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,099
know that he will also let's talk about

518
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
one thing before we get there something

519
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,879
I was just talking about with uh the

520
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,860
last ramble that I got on uh this could

521
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,839
be a seasonal issue

522
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,639
um I noticed that since I'm dealing with

523
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:16,139
different conditions Outdoors during the

524
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,459
winter and different conditions in the

525
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,500
fall and the spring and the summer

526
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,058
because I'm in Colorado our seasons are

527
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,160
drastically noticeable you can tell the

528
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:25,078
difference in Seasons so since I'm here

529
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,579
I do notice that some of my crops are

530
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,740
easier they come out better my winter

531
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,359
crop my fall crop the one that's done

532
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,859
since I've got them scheduled the third

533
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:33,779
crop of the year the one the one that

534
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:35,579
comes around Halloween that one's always

535
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,980
one of my best crops of the year if it's

536
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,139
uh for a smokable flour or for seeded

537
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,538
flour it's always the most successful is

538
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,160
my Halloween run for some reason I don't

539
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:45,720
know why I don't I think it may be the

540
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,700
gear and deal I don't have to cool the

541
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,140
rooms as much so that's what I'm getting

542
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,000
at let me talk about that now I've kind

543
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,500
of segmented my way into that I don't

544
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,660
have to cool the room as much so I think

545
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,940
I get a better stickier tastier product

546
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,640
is your room too hot was your last run

547
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,919
in a dry season in a warm season did the

548
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,020
room get too hot also maybe perhaps did

549
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,460
the room get too dry maybe you're

550
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:07,259
dealing with conditions outside that

551
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,519
it's hard to correct the indoors and

552
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:10,500
your room got a little bit different

553
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,298
maybe the last crop it was a different

554
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,000
season you had that outdoor or that

555
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:16,619
outdoor cool that Halloween crop like I

556
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,759
always get that's super good maybe that

557
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,859
was your last crop maybe you're

558
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,058
comparing that spring crop to your

559
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,259
Halloween crop and they're going to be

560
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,359
totally different just because of

561
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,640
outdoor environmental conditions that

562
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,379
just could be a thing I'm not certainly

563
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
sure that that is it but I've noticed

564
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,440
that my crops are different here at

565
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,000
different times of the year so it could

566
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,058
be temperature it could be humidity it

567
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,980
could be too wet it could be too dry too

568
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:40,319
hot definitely volatizes and burns off

569
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,419
Terps too dry doesn't allow turps to

570
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,759
produce as much too moist will

571
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:46,740
definitely stifle terpene production uh

572
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,298
too cold might not be too bad for Terps

573
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,160
but it is going to slow down some [ __ ]

574
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:51,538
so let's think about temperature

575
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,640
humidity

576
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,220
uh then let's also think about airflow

577
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,440
in the room is there too much airflow is

578
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,880
it too windy imagine if your Terps your

579
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,500
plants your trichomes are just sitting

580
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,120
there in the wind uh you know if you're

581
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,319
on the boat if you're on a motorcycle if

582
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,058
you've got the windows down if you're in

583
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,558
the convertible uh maybe you just got

584
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:09,538
too much wind on your face and you just

585
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:10,740
feel all chafed all day maybe the plants

586
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:12,240
are getting the same thing in there bro

587
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,919
maybe they're just getting beat up by a

588
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,720
fan again I'm not accusing I'm not

589
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,340
pointing fingers I'm just going through

590
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,960
my mind looking in the grow room going

591
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:20,819
what could possibly through my grow

592
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,798
space saying what could possibly be

593
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,418
diminishing Aroma and flavor and

594
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,038
presence of terpenes in this grow space

595
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:29,160
so I'm just checking off the list and

596
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:30,538
seeing what we can identify in your grow

597
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,580
um so we're talking about airflow is it

598
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,319
too windy is it too stagnant you're not

599
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:35,639
are you not getting enough air Exchange

600
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,500
in there do we need to get rid of some

601
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,419
air pull some fresh air in there that

602
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,798
may be part of the situation and I'm

603
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,179
just looking from the top down we're

604
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,400
going to get to the soil at the end here

605
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,740
we'll talk about all this stuff did you

606
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,240
have any issues were there any bugs if

607
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,279
you had any bugs at all that will

608
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,679
definitely slow down uh trichome

609
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,058
production aroma flavor all of that

610
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,500
stuff because the the plants will be

611
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:57,119
focused on different things they'll just

612
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,279
be more focused on protecting and

613
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,859
replenishing the damage that the bugs

614
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,139
are doing uh did you see any visual

615
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:06,538
problems uh did you get a microscope and

616
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,940
look for any problems uh did you spray

617
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:11,700
anything uh maybe something you sprayed

618
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,340
may have changed the aroma and flavor

619
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,900
then were you watering properly did you

620
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,639
have any dry spells were you over

621
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,740
watering did you

622
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,240
um you're using the build of soil did

623
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,740
you replenish everything after you

624
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,779
harvested some of that stuff needs to be

625
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,640
put back in did you add the bloom

626
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,379
boosters did you add the aroma and

627
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,640
flavor enhancers which they recommend I

628
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,260
don't know what that is from build a

629
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,580
soil but I'm sure there's a product they

630
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,558
say this gives you better flavor this

631
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,240
gives better Aroma did you use that

632
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:37,379
because that may have helped out with

633
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,940
you so

634
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,740
um did you over water I think I said

635
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,240
that did you underwater were you uh

636
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,440
checking the soil carefully it says you

637
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,579
ph'd it

638
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,500
um were you making sure that everything

639
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:48,119
was perfect in the soil before you were

640
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,558
watering so maybe there was an issue

641
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:51,719
with the soil maybe you didn't rebuild

642
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:54,000
everything after the last Harvest I'm

643
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,500
not a soil expert so maybe I could be a

644
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
lack of microbes maybe it could have

645
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,319
been a feeding issue there could have

646
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,019
been a lot of things going on there

647
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,000
something I notice uh you said this was

648
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:04,558
happening in the flowering stage but

649
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,599
something else I noticed is that a lot

650
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,279
of people will have really stinky plants

651
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,199
all the way up to the end and then they

652
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:11,940
don't dry and cure properly and that's

653
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,279
where they lose a lot of the flavor and

654
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,740
Aroma also that's where people do bring

655
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,660
out a lot of the flavor and aroma so I'm

656
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,038
curious I'm sure that my by the time

657
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,660
I've read this and by the time this

658
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:23,460
podcast comes out that it will be

659
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,380
Harvest time maybe it's dry cure and

660
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,600
smoke time how did these plants come out

661
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,460
bro now at the end now that it's time to

662
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,899
chop them down how does it smell how

663
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,940
does it taste once you dried it and

664
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,460
cured it then Eddie did any of that

665
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,259
flavor and Aroma come out uh it could be

666
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,538
a dry and cure issue once again that

667
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:41,279
comes to a relative humidity temperature

668
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:43,558
Darkness where they kept in the dark

669
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,940
also were the lights too close to your

670
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:46,678
plants when they were growing that could

671
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,480
be something to think about too were

672
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,460
they closer or further away than last

673
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,900
time did the plants grow taller did you

674
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,400
lower or raise the light did you forget

675
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,140
to raise the light or lower the light

676
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,700
for some reason I'm just throwing out

677
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,840
there all the ideas that I could come up

678
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,640
with

679
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,819
um the main thing to think about is what

680
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,080
changed what is different than last time

681
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:05,339
that's why I always recommend taking a

682
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,139
lot of notes did you write down

683
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:08,639
everything you did last time did you

684
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,799
write down everything you did this time

685
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,320
set those notes side by side and say oh

686
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,179
last time at week three I did this ah

687
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,038
[ __ ] I didn't do this in week three or I

688
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,720
did do this it could be something you

689
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,220
did or didn't do it could be an

690
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,140
environmental change it could be

691
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,298
something major or honestly bro it could

692
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,280
be something very tiny did a product

693
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:28,558
change did the airflow change did your

694
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,200
care change did your defoliation your

695
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,879
popping twisting what is different

696
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,740
that's once again that's why I recommend

697
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,900
taking a lot of notes do you have all

698
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,279
the nutrient notes from last time

699
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,259
um you say you're using the build of

700
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,359
soil like I said maybe that needs to be

701
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:44,099
refreshed and recharged maybe you need

702
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,500
to order a few packages that mix in

703
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,240
there for the next crop the only other

704
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,798
thing I can think of and this has

705
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,740
happened to me and other people think

706
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:55,079
I'm crazy when I say this but maybe you

707
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,759
have got what we call nose blind maybe

708
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,558
you just can't smell it or taste it

709
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,480
anymore because you've been around it so

710
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,058
much and you've become immune to it

711
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,980
stinky people don't know they stink we

712
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:06,658
all enjoy our own brand you may be

713
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,640
sleeping in the house where that herb is

714
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,500
you may sleep there you may wake up

715
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,880
there you may eat breakfast there you

716
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,099
may have lunch there you may go about

717
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,900
your whole entire day there by now you

718
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,639
are totally immune to the smell of that

719
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,100
ganja just because you're there so much

720
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,299
I I know that's extreme but sometimes I

721
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,678
just don't even realize that there's

722
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:24,240
ganja in the house and that you can

723
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,740
smell it and I'll pull up to the house

724
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,120
with a friend like Michael come over and

725
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,038
Mike will be like buddy you got to get a

726
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,239
new carbon filter I can smell it down

727
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:31,859
the block and I'm like what do you mean

728
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,298
bro I don't smell anything and then

729
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:35,099
Michael be like let's go somewhere and

730
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:36,418
we'll go run around in the car for a

731
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:37,619
little bit and not smoke and we'll come

732
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,840
back and I'll be like

733
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,038
ah bro I need a new carbon filter and

734
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,298
he's like yeah bro you just got to get

735
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,759
out because you didn't smell it at all

736
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:46,139
so maybe maybe hopefully that's the

737
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,700
situation you're having maybe all the

738
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,020
Terps are there maybe you're growing

739
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,880
like a pro and a champ and you're just

740
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,500
so good at growing you don't even smell

741
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,659
that crazy dank anymore you've got to

742
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,980
improve and make it even stinkier and

743
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,140
dankier

744
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,480
um there are a few uh products I guess

745
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,059
not products but a few things I can uh

746
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,679
recommend that may help improve that

747
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:06,599
stinkiness maybe a couple of these maybe

748
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,759
a couple of these and combo maybe one or

749
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,879
two by themselves I've always noticed

750
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,158
that kelp based products make my plants

751
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,320
that if it's got a skunky or an earthy

752
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,780
or a cushy or a coffee kind of Aroma

753
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,099
that uh kelp product well I'm not sure

754
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:22,200
what kelp product you're going to buy

755
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,178
there are a lot of them but see kelp in

756
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,720
a product will definitely bring out that

757
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:29,700
funky uh earthy cushy uh gassy those

758
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,700
Aromas are enhanced by kelp in my

759
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,558
opinion in my experience in my grow also

760
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,940
I may recommend adding more sugars and

761
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,759
more microbes that will help with

762
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,620
everything that's always a good idea

763
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,400
carbs microbes that will always help

764
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:43,139
then

765
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,360
something I've noticed that makes plants

766
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,759
funky and stinky all the time is fish

767
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,759
products any ocean products seabird

768
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,519
guano or fish products fish Emulsion

769
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,379
fish meal anything with fish in it will

770
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,538
make your plant I think if you put it

771
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,919
into the nutrient mix into the soil and

772
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,779
it's got a little bit of the proper

773
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,179
stank to it that stink does transfer

774
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:05,399
into the plants stank makes stank so

775
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,200
that's what I think so uh maybe add some

776
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,419
kelp add some fish products definitely

777
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,360
increase the amount of microbe activity

778
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:15,360
in there and that may help with your

779
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:17,279
lack of Aroma and flavor uh bro my

780
