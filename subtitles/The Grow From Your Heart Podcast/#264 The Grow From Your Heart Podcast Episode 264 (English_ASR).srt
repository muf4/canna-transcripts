of some berry cooler shatter and it

48
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,710
really hit the spot you guys I've been

49
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,989
I've been talking about different kinds

50
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:52,929
of concentrates here on the show um I

51
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:54,728
smoked the hdfs C I smoked the the

52
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,710
batter's the rosin 's I don't smoke a

53
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:59,649
lot of raisins I smoked a lot of batters

54
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:02,709
smoked a lot of Ambrosia and live resins

55
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:05,049
and the the Q RCS and the hdfs C

56
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:06,309
honestly no don't go Google and qrc you

57
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,020
guys it's not a real thing I just made

58
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,610
that up don't please don't go google

59
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,560
that that's the future that's alien hash

60
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,170
it's coming soon but I was getting at is

61
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,240
I think I like shatter I've got some

62
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:18,129
batter I've got some live resin I've got

63
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,320
some butters got a lot of great stuff

64
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,909
available but I tend to reach for the

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,159
shatter most often something about the

66
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:25,780
shatter it's affordable it gives me a

67
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,490
giant dab and it just it seems

68
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,289
old-school that's back to when hash

69
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,750
started getting really popular again

70
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:33,759
shatter is where it all started I really

71
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,740
seem to like the shatter but that being

72
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,359
said I think my next dab is going to be

73
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,300
a dab of this screaming tangerines

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,980
batter from apothecary so it's gonna be

75
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,750
a berry cooler and screaming tangerines

76
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,879
type of episode I hope you guys are

77
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,919
smoking on something delicious with me

78
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,719
all right on this podcast I do want to

79
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,819
talk about a little bit of a debate

80
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,129
between organic and synthetic nutrients

81
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:56,049
and organic and synthetic gardening but

82
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:58,389

123
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,939
sometimes I feel like I may over talk a

124
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,410
certain subject but I'm really trying to

125

best advice and guidance I can I can't

128
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,680
make eye contact with anybody when I'm

129
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:28,810
doing this so I don't know if what I'm

130
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,310
saying is sinking in I can't see any

131
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,019
facial expressions so I'm not sure if

132
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,819
people look confused or if they're

133
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,439
catching on so I just over talk my [ __ ]

134

you find it informative because like I

152
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,740
said I like to talk my ass off sometimes

153
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:13,689
I feel like I may be over rambling so

154
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,740
I'm glad you appreciate it and it's good

155

159
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,360
could get to get to be and all

160
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:26,829
applications all growing applications

161
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,389
you know I'm not sure that I talked

162
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:29,889
enough about hydro and stuff like that

163
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:31,660
because that's not my wheelhouse but I

164
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,340
will try to get people in here to talk

165
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,669
about things are out of my comfort zone

166
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:38,258
and teach me and you all things I'm glad

167
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:39,939
you like my guests and I'm glad you like

168
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,939
it when we ramble because sometimes we

169
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:45,219
do take too many dabs we meaning myself

170
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,990
and we do get quite rambling here so I'm

171
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,240
glad you enjoy it thanks for the great

172
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,829
review and thanks for the 5-star rating

173
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,180
I truly do appreciate that

174
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:53,859
once again you guys I would appreciate

175
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,629
it if everybody who listens on iTunes

176
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,030
would go to the iTunes Store and just

177
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:59,860
leave a short sweet review let me know

178
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,049
what you think about the podcast and I

179
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,870
will read your review on a future

180
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,970
episode alright let's get into the main

181
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,319
topic of this podcast now the start of

182
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,419
the show I said that I wanted to talk a

183
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,788
little bit about growing with synthetic

184
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:14,439
vs. growing with organic nutrients

185
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:16,180
before I get too far into this I want to

186
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,029
make some disclaimers and say that I am

187
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,590
NOT on either side of this debate I am a

188
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:22,629
cannabis grower and I support you

189
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,609
growing cannabis the way that you are

190
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,288
passionate about doing so if you want to

191
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,229
grow organically if you want to grow

192
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:31,750
no-till if you want to grow with salts

193
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:33,219
in rockwool however you want to grow I

194
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,079
support you and I love you for growing

195
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,520
cannabis as long as you do so safely and

196
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,859
carefully and you don't apply pesticides

197
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,120
that are gonna make people sick as long

198
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,038
as you're not a corrupt piece of [ __ ] I

199
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,370
support you growing cannabis your way

200
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,538
but also being said I grow mostly from

201
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,970
bottled nutrients

202
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:51,129
I run a large cultivation facility where

203
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:55,330
we have lots of plants lots of lights

204
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:57,728
lots of work to be done I am well versed

205
00:06:55,329 --> 00:07:00,279
in working with bottles and synthetic

206
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:02,228
nutrients on the same hand I've got a

207
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,209
lot of experience using organics and

208
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:06,579
growing organically but I do not have

209
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:08,288
nearly the amount of experience and

210
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:11,050
knowledge as I have with bottled and

211
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:13,300
synthetic nutrients so I may seem biased

212
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,610
in my debate here but I'm going to

213
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,889
try to play evenly on both sides so I

214
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,960
can keep this argument fair for both

215
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,978
sides but I also feel like this

216
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,870
shouldn't be too much of an argument

217
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:24,399
because we can all be friends we're all

218
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,470
growing cannabis I know some people are

219
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,179
haters I know some people have put a lot

220
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,560
of time and energy into perfecting their

221
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,209
technique and they feel like they've got

222
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,800
some hot [ __ ] going on and they feel

223
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:34,000
like they're special I'm not gonna worry

224
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,978
about any of that I'm not gonna play

225
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,399
that game right now I am going to do an

226
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:41,978
unbiased honest personal debate between

227
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,839
organic versus synthetics when it comes

228
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:45,038
to growing cannabis so I'm gonna press

229
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,448
pause I'm gonna actually take a quick

230
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,240
dab of this scream and tangerines before

231
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:53,439
I get into it and when I get back

232
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,090
synthetics versus organics round one all

233
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,459
right podcast world I am back with the

234
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:59,888
ever so pleasant taste of screaming

235
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:03,128
tangerines in my mouth it's like I just

236
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,168
bit into a tangerine delicious alright

237
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:08,020
let's talk about growing with synthetic

238
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:09,430
or organic nutrients now I said it

239
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:11,258
earlier a lot of people think that they

240
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,090
have some special technique mastered a

241
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,639
lot of people that grow organically a

242
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:17,948
lot of the guys to grow no-till a lot of

243
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,560
the guys that grow some fancy Korean

244
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,180
natural farming sort of method they seem

245
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,528
to be kind of sensitive when it comes to

246
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,300
bottled nutrients and they want to talk

247
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:27,879
trash right away because they say

248
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,038
growing with bottles is too easy now

249
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,500
sometimes a new grower may need

250
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:35,199
something easy we don't all have all day

251
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,788
to dedicate to growing aa bottled

252
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,379
nutrients are easy so that's good for a

253
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,028
beginner that's good for a hobby grower

254
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:42,250
it's for good for somebody who is fully

255
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:43,719
employed and has a full time job it's

256
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,269
good for somebody who has a little bit

257
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,180
of space and can't have that doesn't

258
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,649
have space for making extra things some

259
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:52,449
people don't have a lot of room so

260
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:54,700
bottled nutrients are good for these

261
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,550
types of folks bottled nutrients are

262
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,290
good for large facilities the bottled

263
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:02,349
nutrients can be used on all types of

264
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:04,389
grows for someone to dismiss the idea of

265
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,940
growing with synthetic bottled nutrients

266
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:09,819
because it is easy just seems

267
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,380
closed-minded and silly to me don't let

268
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,910
anyone on the internet discourage you

269
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,919
because you're trying to grow with

270
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:16,569
synthetic bottled nutrients it works

271
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,189
it's the most common practice in a

272
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,990
large-scale facility and you're not

273
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,570
doing anything wrong as long as you're

274
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,879
flushing your product at the end so yes

275
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,820
it may be easy but it's also reliable

276
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,720
bottled nutrients are reliable

277
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,240
and in most cases they are available so

278
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,410
I know that whenever I buy a bottle and

279
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,399
I'm just gonna pick a bottom just gonna

280
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:37,049
say what's in front of me I've got a

281
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,669
white jar in front of me I'm gonna say

282
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,839
whenever I buy white jar nutrients and

283
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:41,819
that's not even a real brand so I'm not

284
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,190
advertising for anybody I know that

285
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,290
there's a certain amount of this product

286
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,720
and a certain amount of this product or

287
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:50,789
a ingredient inside of that product and

288
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,560
every time I buy it it should be within

289
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:55,679
a certain range so that my nutrient

290
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,659
mixes are consistent so my product white

291
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,000
jar should be reliable and available

292
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:02,639
when I need it it may not be available

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,049
that may be a con to you what the bottle

294
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,399
that you're trying to get may not be

295
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,199
available in your area

296
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,789
jimena you may not have a gross store in

297
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,650
your area you may not be able to go to

298
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:12,689
the gross store so for guys like that

299
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:14,340
you may want to lean more toward the

300
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,080
organics if you're in a farming area

301
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,879
people are gonna be buying farming [ __ ]

302
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,160
anyway all the organic stuff is gonna be

303
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,100
available use that that may be the way

304
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,019
to go for you but I feel like the

305
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,090
bottled nutrients are reliable and

306
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,220
available and almost everyone's got

307
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,600
amazon available to them so I feel like

308
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,100
everybody should be able to get just

309
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,139
about any bottled product shipped to

310
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,800
them as long as they can find it on the

311
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:40,470
internet oh one of the pros of bottled

312
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:43,319
nutrients is feed charts are easy to

313
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,910
follow no matter what brand of nutrients

314
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,320
you were using out there you can type it

315
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:48,179
in and there will be a feed chart

316
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,950
available for that brand and then you

317
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,439
can adjust that feed chart for your

318
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:55,410
particular plant but the feed charts are

319
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,540
easy to follow um if you're making

320
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:00,120
organics you've got websites like build

321
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:01,559
a soil and places like that but you're

322
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,820
gonna have to build a soil and you're

323
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:04,739
gonna have to get all those amendments

324
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,970
and things shipped to you and then

325
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,350
you're gonna have to mix them and

326
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,509
hopefully you get all the mixes right

327
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,950
and hopefully nothing's too hot and then

328
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:12,299
once you get it mixed you're gonna have

329
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,070
to let it cook and it's gonna have to

330
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:15,870
sit for a little while so that's one of

331
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,790
the cons of working with organics is

332
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,980
that it's not as consistent and it's not

333
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:21,899
as reliable in my experience and in my

334
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,120
opinion once you get it dialed in it

335
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,529
will be perfect but I'm sure the getting

336
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,080
it dialed in will take a couple of

337
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,490
trials and errors now if you're brand

338
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,810
new and you're growing with this soil

339
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,669
that you just made and your plants

340
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,989
messing up your soil is mix and you're

341
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:35,729
gonna have a hard time figuring out

342
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,740
what's wrong because you're a new grower

343
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,420
and now you've got to figure out what's

344
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,389
wrong with the plant and how to fix the

345
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:41,799
soil now

346
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:43,929
if you've got a relationship with the

347
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,339
soil that's not as hard to do but when

348
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:46,509
you're a brand-new grower and you don't

349
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,399
know your plants you don't know your

350
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:50,110
soil as well this is where bottled

351
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,789
nutrients may be able to help you may

352
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,259
look at the plant and you can say [ __ ]

353
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:54,370
this is wrong you go to the internet the

354
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,929
internet tells you or you listen to

355
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,990
Rasta Jeff we figure out what's wrong

356
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:00,609
with your plants then you can get the

357
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,350
correct bottle and you can treat the

358
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,139
plants with that bottle I know that

359
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,330
sounds simple and that's the way some

360
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:08,830
people need it you guys that are doing

361
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,420
the organics you've already built that

362
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,920
relationship I'm sure most of you that

363
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:13,689
are doing the organics started with

364
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,939
bottles like a lot of us start on

365
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,680
bottles then we graduate up to the

366
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,360
organics and that's how you learn to

367
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,039
spot the deficiencies so that when you

368
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,210
mix up your soil you can see what was

369
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,219
wrong with the plant you can learn how

370
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,110
to fix it by topdressing or mix it in a

371
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,240
tea I also feel like a lot of you guys

372
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,769
grow in the organics and no tills if you

373
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,269
didn't start with bottled nutrients and

374
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:33,279
graduate to the organics I feel like you

375
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:34,960
started with some sort of horticultural

376
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,370
experience in your background and your

377
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,810
family is where a lot of you guys

378
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,610
learned it that's what I've noticed is

379
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:41,199
from paying attention so what I was

380
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,060
gonna get to what I was talking about is

381
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,460
feed charts are available that's one of

382
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:46,989
the great pros of growing with bottled

383
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,700
nutrients feed charts are there you can

384
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,379
google it you can print it out you can

385
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,450
post it up on the wall it's always gonna

386
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:54,700
be there feed charts are reliable ah

387
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,340
Grandma and Grandpa's old organics

388
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,259
recipes crazy old man Steve's organic

389
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,300
recipe Mountain Tom's recipe that shit's

390
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:02,860
gonna work if you've got that recipe if

391
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:04,449
somebody gave you that recipe on how to

392
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,519
grow cannabis on how to mix up things

393
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,990
how to prep things how to feed things as

394
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,360
long as somebody passed that down to you

395
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,009
but that's not available to everybody so

396
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,690
that's where bottled nutrients come in

397
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,189
not everybody had somebody in their

398
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,140
family to teach them this kind of stuff

399
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,580
or not everybody had it as a passion so

400
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:21,819
the bottles are good for those folks

401
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:25,690
let's see let's talk about the cost of

402
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,730
bottles versus organics the cost one

403
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,770
thing about the cost of bottle is you're

404
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,759
paying for water to be shipped across

405
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,250
the country

406
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:36,250
so let's just say if you're buying white

407
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,710
jar products and that company is in

408
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,779
California and a lot of their stuff that

409
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,830
they're sourcing comes from California

410
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,329
it's probably gonna come from

411
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,350
hopefully states around there but maybe

412
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,910
they're [ __ ] they can't get in

413
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,379
California maybe they have to have part

414
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:50,740
of their ingredients shipped from

415
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,700
Massachusetts so now you've got a pallet

416
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,440
of stuff being shipped from

417
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,100
Massachusetts to California to get

418
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,079
distributed

419
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,909
into a bunch of bottles to get mixed

420
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,149
with water to get back on a truck to get

421
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:02,559
shipped to a gross store in Colorado so

422
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,448
that you can buy it so that you can

423
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,518
drive it to your house so that you can

424
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:07,870
then add more water to it and then feed

425
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,039
it to your plants so when you buy a

426
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,568
bottle nutrients you're paying for

427
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,769
trucks to drive across the country over

428
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:13,328
and over again is kind of what I'm

429
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,759
getting at you're paying for people to

430
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:18,129
ship you water that kind of sucks you're

431
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,079
also paying for plastic bottles a lot of

432
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:21,578
your organic stuff sure some of the

433
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,318
organic stuff does come in bottles but a

434
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:25,328
lot of the organic stuff is being

435
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:28,000
produced by the organic grower they are

436
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:29,769
making it themselves along with their

437
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,929
kin of their cannabis garden so it's a

438
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,698
symbiotic grow they're growing the cover

439
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:35,919
crop in the pot that the cannabis is

440
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:37,870
growing in they're growing so it's all

441
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,870
happening in one container there's less

442
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,129
packaging less shipping and less less

443
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,240
harm to the environment but that's

444
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:43,778
something we're gonna talk about here in

445
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,209
a little bit

446
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:48,669
so the the difference in cost with

447
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,318
bottled nutrients you're paying for a

448
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:51,818
lot of water you're paying for a lot of

449
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:53,229
labels you're paying for a lot of brand

450
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:54,849
names when it comes to organic

451
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,528
amendments a lot of that stuff comes in

452
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,019
a cardboard box it doesn't have a brand

453
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:01,059
name on it a lot of it was possibly

454
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:02,769
grown by another local farmer a lot of

455
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,508
it was traded from farmer to farmer a

456
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,929
lot of it was grown like I said earlier

457
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:09,009
by the grower that is going to use it

458
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:10,269
organics is kind of cheaper because you

459
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,250
don't have to pay for anything to be

460
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,379
processed it is what it is if you're

461
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,028
buying bat [ __ ] you were getting bat

462
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,588
[ __ ] if you're buying liquid bat [ __ ]

463
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:19,838
from a nutrient company you're probably

464
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,250
getting bat [ __ ] and water and then

465
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,630
something else that they put in there so

466
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,909
that they could write on the label hey

467
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:27,578
there's this other cool [ __ ] in there so

468
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:29,318
organics may be a little bit cheaper but

469
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,609
that is probably mostly because you

470
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:32,559
don't have to pay for that advanced

471
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,389
nutrients or that botanic hair label on

472
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,000
your bottle and you don't have to pay

473
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:39,909
for as much processing of the materials

474
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,129
so that's a little bit on the cost let's

475
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:44,110
talk about I said the availability of

476
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:46,360
bottles and organics earlier I mentioned

477
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,789
that if you lived in some places like if

478
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,769
you live in a farming area you may not

479
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:53,259
have a hydroponic store store in your

480
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:55,060
neighborhood you may not have the hydro

481
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:57,100
warehouse or grow a warehouse for all

482
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:59,888
long distance around you may have to go

483
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,159
to Amazon but at that farming store at

484
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:05,019
that garden supply store or the whatever

485
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,600
you've got in your area you may have a

486
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,789
whole bunch of agricultural and

487
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,790
supplies available to you that you can

488
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:15,099
use to make great organic amendments I'm

489
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:17,769
sure that you can find everything that

490
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,230
frosty spoke about either at your local

491
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:22,389
garden supply store or if you're in that

492
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,340
type of area maybe one of your local

493
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:26,049
farmers has got what you're looking for

494
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,180
and you guys can work out something put

495
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:29,649
a few bucks in his pocket maybe return a

496
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:31,599
few buds to his pipe when you're done

497
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,850
you never know what you could work out

498
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,920
and like I said earlier everybody's got

499
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,080
Amazon so you can get your hands on

500
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,429
every nutrient that you can think of you

501
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,440
could probably get your hands on every

502
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:43,719
amendment you could think of somewhere

503
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,400
but if you're gonna grow organics you

504
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,100
probably want to source everything as

505
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:51,269
locally as you can but I get it that's

506
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:54,639
not always possible so let's talk about

507
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:57,250
one of the downsides to organics is the

508
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,259
extra prep time if you want to make some

509
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,059
soil if you want to make some teas

510
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:03,340
almost all of that organic stuff

511
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:06,639
especially the ferments those things all

512
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,559
take time you have to plan ahead so your

513
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,089
first grow you may be out of rhythm it

514
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,338
may take you a couple of grows to get

515
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:14,828
your rhythm down because your teas need

516
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:16,838
to cook for 24 or 48 hours they need to

517
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:19,448
brew your soil needs to cook for like

518
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,679
three to six maybe eight weeks it

519
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,660
depends on what you're putting in there

520
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,549
so all of your organic stuff is going to

521
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,620
take more prep more cook and more

522
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:28,720
planned time which means it's also going

523
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,059
to take more space so in my opinion

524
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,250
that's some of the cons of growing

525
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,450
organically also one of the things that

526
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,980
you don't get as much with bottled

527
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,559
nutrients that you do really get when

528
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,110
you're growing organically is some stink

529
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,299
a lot of the organic nutrients and a lot

530
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:45,819
of the organic amendments any of the

531
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,319
fermentations a lot of the compost teas

532
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:50,079
a lot of the teas you're gonna brew

533
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:51,549
they're going to smell terrible if

534
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,069
you've got a small house or a small

535
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:55,629
space it's gonna stink it up so it's

536
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:57,220
gonna take more time it's gonna take a

537
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,500
little more space and it might stink a

538
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,839
little bit more if you're using organics

539
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,670
if you're a weirdo like me you may enjoy

540
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,720
some of those funky ass smells and it

541
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,060
may be the highlight of your day

542
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,039
sometimes so it may take you a little

543
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,539
more time if you're gonna make teas and

544
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,220
if you're gonna make your own soils and

545
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,319
things like that

546
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,299
but if that's what you want to do that's

547
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,679
another thing to do if you have more

548
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,019
stuff if you want to be more involved in

549
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,308
your garden that is a great way to do it

550
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:23,200
so you

551
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:25,450
to pre-plan you organics you have to be

552
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,190
on top of it you have to have your if

553
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,259
you're going to make your own pesticides

554
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,210
if you're gonna make your own sprays you

555
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:32,919
have to get on top of those way before

556
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,629
its time to need them one of the good

557
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:36,249
things about bottled pesticides and

558
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:37,628
bottled nutrients is if you see a

559
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,579
problem you can walk over there and grab

560
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:41,199
that bottle and shake it up and you can

561
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:43,240
mix it and you can apply it there's no

562
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,110
waiting but it's also a dangerous

563
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,788
pesticide so it's got its pros and cons

564
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:50,829
you've got to pre-plan your organics a

565
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:53,859
little bit more than I feel like you've

566
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:56,109
got to pre-plan your synthetics also

567
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:58,359
there's that extra space for the extra

568
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:59,618
the trash can that you're brewing or the

569
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,508
five gallon buckets you're brewing your

570
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:03,339
teas in your jars that you're making

571
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:05,378
ferments and sometimes that makes takes

572
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:06,878
a little extra space not a whole bunch

573
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:09,579
because you'd have bottled nutrients

574
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:11,469
anyway but if you're making things like

575
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:13,118
we heard frosty say did he'd grind stuff

576
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,740
up real small he put some stuff in a

577
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,209
blender so he's already got a grinder

578
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,798
and a blender I don't have that in my

579
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,509
grow so it would be two more things that

580
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:22,179
I would have to add so there's a little

581
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:23,470
bit more extra equipment but it'll be

582
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:25,298
worth it because you don't have to ship

583
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,259
a bunch of bottles across the country do

584
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,298
you see how it's weighing out you guys

585
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:32,169
there are pros and cons to both of these

586
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:34,058
so with organics it's much easier to

587
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:36,100
reuse and recycle your soil especially

588
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:38,138
if you're going no-till so that means

589
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:39,699
less trash you guys the less stuff you

590
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:41,888
have to throw away for our environment

591
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,558
the better we're gonna get to that part

592
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:47,229
here pretty soon so it's a lot easier to

593
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,999
recondition and recycle and reuse soil

594
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,798
that was grown in organically especially

595
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:52,990
the no-till style you just pull a plant

596
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,179
out and go back right back in it but if

597
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,700
you try to recycle and reuse your

598
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,320
synthetic or your soil that was fed with

599
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,610
synthetic nutrients it may be too hot

600
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,499
there may be stuff stuck in there

601
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:04,329
hopefully yes you did flush but

602
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:05,980
sometimes that some stuff will stick in

603
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,528
there I wouldn't recommend regrowing

604
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,599
in soil that you used synthetic

605
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:11,919
nutrients in you can throw that outside

606
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:13,839
and put that in the veggie garden

607
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,309
outside next summer or do something like

608
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,230
that let it turn outside in the dirt

609
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:18,999
maybe mix it with some fresh dirt with a

610
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,440
bunch of organics but I wouldn't go

611
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:22,600
straight back into it it needs some love

612
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,129
they need some reconditioning and it may

613
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:25,719
be too hot and it may be kind of funky

614
00:20:24,128 --> 00:20:27,158
from having all of those synthetic

615
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,288
nutrients poured through it even if he

616
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,028
did flush it I just don't like reusing

617
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:32,798
it I don't know I would mix it with some

618
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:34,450
fresh dirt at least but I would

619
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,029
recommend putting it outdoors

620
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,890
let the

621
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:38,720
bake all that crap out of it let the

622
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,430
earth do what it does to it and fix it

623
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,009
for you and just get some fresh dirt for

624
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,380
inside well let's see when you're

625
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:47,390
growing with organics it seems to be

626
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,340
more forgiving in my opinion you are not

627
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,200
pouring concentrated nutrients into your

628
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:52,939
plant so if you make a little bit of a

629
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,390
mistake if you over a measure or under

630
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,940
measure

631
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,490
I feel like organics gives you a lot

632
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,410
more leeway you're not pouring like I

633
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,049
said concentrated chemicals into the

634
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,269
root zone feeding your plant an overdose

635
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:07,369
really easily it seems like the plants

636
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,779
kind of know what to take and what to

637
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:10,519
absorb and what to eat a little more

638
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:12,799
when you're going organically when

639
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,750
you're going synthetically you're kind

640
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,379
of force feeding them everything is

641
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,880
right there

642
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,470
everything's buffered they suck it all

643
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,620
up and they can over feed themselves

644
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:24,380
very easily also it's very easy to get a

645
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:26,899
salt build-up problem with synthetic

646
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,490
nutrients if your pH gets off a little

647
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,050
bit or you start getting a salt build-up

648
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,880
you start getting a lock out your plants

649
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:34,369
start changing colors [ __ ] starts going

650
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,800
bad really quickly that's much less

651
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:39,559
likely when you're growing with organics

652
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,970
don't don't try to challenge me and go

653
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:43,190
crazy and feed your plants a bunch of

654
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,930
ridiculous organic [ __ ] because you can

655
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,519
cause problems with the organics I'm

656
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,430
just saying it's a little bit more

657
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,079
forgiving now since I said that I kind

658
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:54,380
of triggered myself into a whole another

659
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:57,439
rant um you guys don't be sold by the

660
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,660
word organic organic has become such a

661
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,340
buzzword lately they can print organic

662
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,019
on a package and put it next to a

663
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:04,369
package that doesn't say organic on it

664
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,900
they could be the same damn thing and I

665
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,579
guarantee you the one with the word

666
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,170
organic on it is going to sell just

667
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:12,619
because of the word organic printed on

668
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:14,180
the package um water is organic but they

669
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:15,859
don't print it on the bottles I bet if I

670
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,810
printed it on one bottle you would buy

671
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:20,209
that one instead I bet if I printed

672
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:22,339
gluten-free organic dairy-free sodium

673
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,660
free I put that [ __ ] on there and didn't

674
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:26,899
put it on the other one bottle next to

675
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:30,170
it would sell so be careful being sold

676
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:33,170
by the word organic cyanide is organic

677
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:36,470
you guys cyanide can [ __ ] kill you

678
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,210
and it's organic alright keep that in

679
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,160
mind just because people say their

680
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,569
plants are organic doesn't mean they're

681
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,019
perfectly safe it doesn't mean they're

682
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,679
harmless

683
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:46,879
don't be sold by buzz words and I'm not

684
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,808
just talking about just cannabis I'm

685
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,450
talking about in every product you can

686
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:54,558
soon every product you rub on your body

687
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,759
any product you put on your face read

688
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,638
organic on the label does not mean it's

689
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,919
all organic organic doesn't mean that a

690
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:04,888
product excuse me is specifically safer

691
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,799
for you actually read about let's just

692
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:09,359
pick one on this list read about

693
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:12,089
nicotine sulfate nicotine sulfate is

694
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:16,829
organic it's a neurotoxin and when they

695
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:20,128
tested it on humans it killed them but

696
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:22,949
it's organic and it's also approved in

697
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:25,259
organic farming so before you are too

698
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,480
mesmerized by the word organic keep in

699
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:31,919
mind that things like like cyanide and

700
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,298
nicotine sulfate are organic and they

701
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,830
can kill you all right so let's get back

702
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,648
on track here another thing I want to

703
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:42,388
talk about is mono ammonium phosphate a

704
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:44,368
lot of the bloom boosters that you buy

705
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:46,258
especially powdered bloom boosters

706
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:48,388
there's one in particular that I'm not

707
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,730
sure I want to say the name of it but it

708
00:23:48,388 --> 00:23:52,829
is mostly mono ammonium phosphate that

709
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:56,610
is mostly what though the whole product

710
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:59,158
is now mono ammonium phosphate excuse me

711
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:01,349
is formed when a solution of phosphoric

712
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,659
acid is added to ammonia until the

713
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:06,240
solution is distinctly acidic and that

714
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,559
is largely used in agricultural

715
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,298
fertilizers that information actually

716
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:10,528
came from Wikipedia but I knew that

717
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:14,638
already is just reading it off there to

718
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:17,249
keep myself in in line oftentimes

719
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:19,589
cannabis grown with a lot of mono

720
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:22,618
ammonium phosphate has been proven to

721
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:24,388
give people a headache and have adverse

722
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:26,849
health reactions to people who already

723
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:28,829
had a compromised immune system or were

724
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:31,048
already experiencing a medical condition

725
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:33,210
so if you are growing with synthetic

726
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:35,700
nutrients check your bloom boosters and

727
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:39,298
see if you are applying mono ammonium

728
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,480
phosphate or dial ammonium phosphate map

729
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:44,429
and DAP are commonly used in fertilizers

730
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,669
but I'm starting to think they should

731
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:49,048
not be used in things we smoke so make

732
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:50,730
sure your fertilizers don't have mono

733
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:53,009
ammonium phosphate or diammonium

734
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,200
phosphate sand if they do maybe consider

735
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:58,110
switching bloom boosters maybe consider

736
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,690
switching to organics if you want to

737
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:02,000
read more about map and DAP Google Kyle

738
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,680
kushman and map

739
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,329
that fertilizers and a lot of great

740
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,920
articles will pop up Kyle is the one

741
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:09,049
that brought this to my attention

742
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,420
Kyle kushman actually grows with a

743
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,700
program that he calls vegan matrix and

744
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,039
it is vegan growing so it's organic with

745
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,500
no animal products although the line

746
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:20,569
that he did put out had some there was

747
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,210
some type of ocean creature in one of

748
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:25,009
his products but uh veganic growing you

749
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,160
guys no animal products at all so that

750
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:30,680
means no poop so no bat guano no seabird

751
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:34,700
guano no chicken [ __ ] no horse manure no

752
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:37,160
cow manure no poop all veganic no [ __ ]

753
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,750
that's his sales pitch no [ __ ] alright

754
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,120
so we've talked about map and dab we've

755
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:44,240
talked about veganic growing let's talk

756
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,159
about one thing that you organic non

757
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,380
bottled growers are going to have the

758
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,240
advantage on here's one thing that most

759
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,060
of us don't think about the end of the

760
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,650
[ __ ] world one day shit's gonna go

761
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,119
wrong and there will not be an

762
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,910
electrical grid there will not be a

763
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:00,289
gross store there will not be Amazon to

764
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:04,070
deliver your [ __ ] to your front door

765
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:06,589
if we have one thing we can still grow

766
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:08,509
if we've got the Sun and maybe just a

767
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:10,519
nice patch of dirt we can still grow

768
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:13,819
cannabis you guys so you guys are

769
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:15,500
growing organically when the end of the

770
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:16,970
world comes you guys are going to win

771
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,259
because there will be no growth store

772
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,150
there will be no feed chart there will

773
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,859
be no Google all you guys are going to

774
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,180
have the advantage then so that's that's

775
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:25,939
one of the advantages of growing

776
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,560
organically you guys so more of the

777
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,620
great benefits and advantages of growing

778
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,599
organically are the sustainability um us

779
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:35,119
guys growing out of bottled nutrients

780
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:37,159
we're just sucking up resources and

781
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,500
eventually the resources we're sucking

782
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,080
up are going to run out we're not able

783
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,299
to provide ourselves with the amounts of

784
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:46,359
products that we need because we're not

785
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:49,789
making it ourselves we're relying on a

786
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:51,409
manufacturer distributor a vendor

787
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:55,579
whatever there are several steps in our

788
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:58,430
chain it's not sustainable you guys I

789
00:26:55,579 --> 00:27:00,319
don't think so in my opinion I don't

790
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,000
think my grow I've got a large

791
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,119
commercial medical growth that I am in

792
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,069
charge of and I do not think that I

793
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,500
could run it organically with my level

794
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:11,750
of experience and produce the quality

795
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,160
and quantity and consistency that we do

796
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,690
with synthetic nutrients I think on a

797
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,730
large scale like what I'm doing in

798
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,620
doors I think the bottled synthetic

799
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,690
nutrients are the way to go if I were in

800
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:24,109
a greenhouse or outdoors I may change my

801
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:26,420
mind on it but so far I think that the

802
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,619
application for indoors is a synthetic

803
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,690
environment I think as soon as I go

804
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:32,000
outdoors I would switch to the organics

805
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,710
that's my opinion on that one but when

806
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,569
it comes to sustainability I think you

807
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,920
guys doing the organics you're doing the

808
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:38,929
right thing you can make your own stuff

809
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,210
you can recycle your own dirt you were

810
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,920
using you were recycling your food waste

811
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,059
you were doing positive things for the

812
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,670
environment which is what I want to move

813
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:48,829
into next the bottled nutrient guys are

814
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,330
ruining the environment slowly we're

815
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:52,399
shipping bottles of water back and forth

816
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:55,909
across the country we're wasting a lot

817
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:59,720
of stuff that's not good so the

818
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:01,190
reliability for large-scale the ease for

819
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,390
a new grower the ease for a hobby grower

820
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,080
those are the things that make bottled

821
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,490
nutrients worth it but the long-term

822
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,990
environmental costs our carbon footprint

823
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,420
that's what would make switching to

824
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,740
organics worth it for me but since I run

825
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,779
a large scale product production

826
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,910
facility that is based on numbers and if

827
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:19,819
I don't produce those numbers there are

828
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:21,410
consequences I cannot take the risks of

829
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:23,599
switching to a synthetic regimen and

830
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:25,190
having to relearn everything I've got

831
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,199
our bottled system figured out very well

832
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,240
I've got it dialed in we're pulling

833
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,519
great lab tests we're pulling great

834
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,400
weights our patients are happy the

835
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,319
owners are happy I am happy so I

836
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,820
couldn't make the switch right now if we

837
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,039
started some [ __ ] out door I would hire

838
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:41,569
a guy like frosty or a guy like Shawn to

839
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:43,339
come fully educate me or a guy like

840
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:45,439
Jesse to come fully educate me on the

841
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:47,779
outdoor setups and then I would be a

842
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,600
black male a black belt outdoor grower

843
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,950
just like those guys so let's wrap it up

844
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,629
here you guys let's talk about in

845
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:56,690
summation let's talk about the pros and

846
00:28:53,630 --> 00:29:00,370
cons of bottle versus synthetics I think

847
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:03,519
some of the pros of growing from organic

848
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:05,899
nutrients is the sustainability the

849
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,180
positive effect on the environment the

850
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,769
recycling that we're doing the long-term

851
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,750
I think that's great

852
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,700
between medicine I think that that is a

853
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,500
great thing the ability to make your own

854
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,930
nutrients I think that's a great thing

855
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,420
some of the cons of growing organically

856
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:23,690
there's a lot of extra prep work it's

857
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,610
gonna stink you may need more space and

858
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,500
it's definitely gonna take more planning

859
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:29,039
and more time

860
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,140
now some of the

861
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,859
pros of growing with bottled nutrients

862
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,150
they are available and they are reliable

863
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:37,829
anybody with enough time to mix up some

864
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,900
nutrients and read a feed chart should

865
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:42,869
be able to work a garden ran off of

866
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,580
bottled nutrients it is fairly easy it

867
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:45,719
is easy if you're a new grower if you're

868
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:47,819
a hobby grower if you're somebody

869
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,529
growing in a closet it's easier if

870
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,779
you're running a large scale facility

871
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:54,569
it's still fairly easy to mix up a large

872
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:56,849
amount of nutrients pH it feed it to the

873
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:58,889
plants it's reliable and it's consistent

874
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:01,829
and it is a great start it is a good way

875
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,540
to mix up a batch of nutrients and start

876
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:05,250
learning your plants and then if you

877
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,649
want to sway away from that and go

878
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,000
organic in the future you've got a good

879
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,440
foundation you've wondered about the

880
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,029
plants you've learned about growing and

881
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,529
then you can learn how to make your own

882
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:18,029
stuff and make the switch so some of the

883
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:19,859
cons of growing with bottles ah you have

884
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:22,109
to pay money to ship them you have to

885
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,729
dispose of a bunch of bottles that's one

886
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:25,259
of the shitty things you have to worry

887
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,419
gonna put them if you don't live in an

888
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:28,710
illegal state where you can grow you

889
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:30,030
have to hide those bottles when you

890
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,370
throw them away nobody can see your

891
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:33,808
advance nutrients Big Bud or you're

892
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:36,418
gonna get in trouble that's gonna suck

893
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:37,859
also look out for a map and dap if

894
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,290
you're drawing synthetically things like

895
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:41,699
that will cause you problems you have to

896
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:42,839
flush with both people think you don't

897
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,360
have to flush if you're growing

898
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,339
organically unless you're growing

899
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,168
no-till you're going to need some flush

900
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:51,359
time or it will affect the way your

901
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:53,250
final product burns clean out that

902
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,990
excess silica clean out that excess

903
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,419
whatever get it out of there all that

904
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,710
excess nitrogen get it out make your

905
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:01,530
plants burn and taste a little bit

906
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:03,600
better so let's wrap up the friendly

907
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:06,359
debate about organics versus synthetics

908
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,039
by saying I feel like bottled nutrients

909
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,199
is a great way to start if you're a new

910
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:12,119
grower start off with the bottles get a

911
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,470
good relationship with the plants with

912
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,469
the rhythms of the plant learn how to

913
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,269
grow learn how to get a few grows under

914
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,069
your belt learn how to grow learn how to

915
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:22,019
grow from seed learn how to spot males

916
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:24,210
learn how to take clones learn how to

917
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,339
Wally pop learned how to defoliate learn

918
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,990
how to crack the stems to make more

919
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:30,089
productive plants learn how to trellis

920
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,160
things down learn canopy control get

921
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:33,599
stuff like that dialed in become a good

922
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,370
grower and then once you start

923
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,709
understanding the plants once you start

924
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:39,509
being able to identify deficiencies and

925
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,669
learning things to do to increase your

926
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:42,390
yields start finding ways to dial back

927
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,980
the bottom

928
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,560
and replace those bottles with some

929
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:50,160
organics and make the switch graduate

930
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,190
from bottles into organics and become a

931
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,450
black belt that way and don't forget

932
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,340
when the end of the world comes you guys

933
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,170
you're only gonna have the bottles that

934
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:59,639
you've got and once you run out those

935
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,110
will be gone you're gonna have to learn

936
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,480
how to do it like all the farmers do

937
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:05,189
just like the organic guys all right now

938
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,049
let's stop being uh let's stop bickering

939
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,789
with each other over organics over

940
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:10,319
synthetics they all have their place

941
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:11,849
they all have their purpose

942
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,369
everybody can grow the way that they

943
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:16,379
want we are all cannabis soldiers we are

944
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:18,689
all cannabis growers we are a community

945
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,910
let's quit arguing let's quit bickering

946
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,289
let's raise each other up let's do it

947
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,210
right you guys we're bringing ourselves

948
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:24,960
out of the dark ages we don't have to

949
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,370
hide anymore

950
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,960
there's no reason to be weird there's no

951
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:31,979
reason to be sketchy we could talk about

952
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,480
this this is a it's actually an industry

953
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,740
now we don't have to be [ __ ] we

954
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,059
don't have to act like we're artists

955
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,799
doing some secretive [ __ ] you're not

956
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:39,720
your girl cannabis it's a [ __ ] plant

957
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:41,339
you guys can all learn as much as I do

958
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,170
about as I know about cannabis just by

959
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:46,169
reading and studying and doing it that's

960
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:48,120
all you have to do so let's not be dicks

961
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,320
to each other let's not act like we're

962
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:51,179
all the Wizard of Oz or something

963
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,220
because we're not we're growing plants

964
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,660
nature was doing it long before you got

965
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,250
involved in nature had it [ __ ]

966
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,750
mastered you're just you're just

967
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,920
facilitating you're just giving it a

968
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,960
little place to do it and you're kind of

969
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,310
getting in the way so stop acting like

970
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,620
you're a Jedi stop acting like you're a

971
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:06,599
ninja we're all just pot growers playing

972
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:09,869
with some plants all right so we're all

973
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:12,389
one now the no-till guys the bottle guys

974
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:14,819
the commercial guys the closet guys the

975
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,560
seed breeders the pollen chuckers the

976
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:18,419
guys that kill plants the brown thumbs

977
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,889
