retailer if you need new seeds for your

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,010
garden I highly recommend Oregon elite

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,010
seeds and you can find them at

10
00:00:22,278 --> 00:01:24,959
www.cdxzipstream.com a be curious what

11
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,210
is that Buckeye banana the Buckeye

12
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,688
banana is the Ohio Buckeye from Melvin

13
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,849
etics cross - the banana og from Texas

14
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:34,739
kid I've got some pollen from that plant

15
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,839
and I applied that to the blueberry

16
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,158
cookies and the strawberry fields I

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,140
think those will make some very

18
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,390
interesting crosses I don't plan to

19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,090
release those seeds at least not the F

20
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,349
ones maybe further generations my

21
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,600
initial goal here with this original

22
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,789
pollination is to create a few seeds for

23
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,589
myself to play with I'm really excited

24
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,618
to find a male from the blueberry

25
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,960
cookies Buckeye banana cross I'm hoping

26
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,420
to find a male that stays kind of short

27
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,609
kind of squat kind of branchy I want

28
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,710
tight internode spacing I'm hoping to

29
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,780
have big fat indica dominant leaves I'm

30
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,340
hoping to find a male it doesn't take a

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,020
really long time to start producing

32
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,120
pollen I want sort of a shorter

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,860
flowering plant at this time I'm also

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,050
hoping that that plant carries the

35
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,060
aroma from the blueberry cookies but

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,430
then I want the colors from the Buckeye

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,370
purple then I want the trichome content

38
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,110
from the banana og so I know what I'm

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,819
looking for on this mail I just have to

40
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,400
find it in the amount of seeds that I

41
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,949
create I anticipate I've created about

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,050
thirty to fifty seeds in my experience

43
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:36,239
with the size plant that I pollinated I

44
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,100
didn't have as much pollen as I wish I

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,840
would have had but I feel like I did a

46
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,419
pretty good job pollinating those little

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,979
tiny plants so in several weeks those

48
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,169
seeds will be done I'll harvest the

49
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,759
plants I'll dry the plants I'll crack up

50
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,899
the buds I'll get the seeds out I'll

51
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,759
pick a few seeds

52
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,280
I'll germinate them I will grow them

53
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,799
hopefully I find a super stud of a male

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,959
in that first batch of seeds hopefully I

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,170
find a couple of sexy females in that

56
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,270
first batch of seeds based on what I see

57
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:05,339
from that first batch of seeds I will

58
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,320
make my decisions on which plants I

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,200
choose to pollinate with that new male

60
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,340
plant and I will also decide if I choose

61
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,009
to make f2s

62
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,319
or further generations of this seed line

63
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:18,030
I can't really make any commitments or

64
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,680
get too big of an idea at this point in

65
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,659
time because I don't know what I am

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,790
creating I like to have confidence I

67
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,009
like to believe in myself I like to feel

68
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:27,870
like I have a good intuition but these

69
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:29,969
plants may not breed well together that

70
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,129
is always an option I may have made just

71
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:33,900
a bunch of crap so I need to grow them

72
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,239
myself I need to see what I've created

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,980
before I get too excited I don't need to

74
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
put the cart in front of my horse and

75
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,340
start thinking about where I'm going to

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,950
sprinkle the pollen from a plant that

77
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,539
hasn't been selected yet so I can't make

78
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:48,209
any decisions I can't make any future

79
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,310
plans with this project until the

80
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,590
pollination creates seeds the seeds are

81
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,170
grown and I take a lot of notes and then

82
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,580
I know what I've got to work with all

83
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,349
right podcast world I've got one more

84
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,760
thing I'd like to mention before we get

85
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:02,099
to the main topic of the show which of

86
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,810
course is going to be the endo Expo I

87
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,849
would like to announce that I read

89
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,409

94
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,620
all right let's jump into the main topic

95
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,259
of this show which is the endo Expo the

96
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,720
endo Expo is the world

97
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:32,539
largest indoor cannabis and hemp expo

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,090
and it landed in denver on january 26th

99
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,580
and 27th and i was lucky enough to be

100
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,709
invited to be a vendor with oregon elite

101
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:42,139
seeds this year the past couple of years

102
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,879
I have attended the endo Expo as a

103
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:46,399
visitor I got to walk around and check

104
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,199
out the expo see all of the booths see

105
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,759
all of the vending see what was going on

106
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,250
in the entire place I walked a hundred

107
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
miles each weekend but this year

108
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,779
I got to share a booth with my friends

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,209
Oregon elite seeds our friends from

110
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,829
Oregon elite seeds hosted a booth and we

111
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:03,049
brought several breeders to the booth

112
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:05,000
with us we had always be flowering

113
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,949
hanging out we had Med tree seeds

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,959
hanging out with us and over the weekend

115
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:11,300
we had docs tank passed through we had

116
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,399
shoreline seeds pass through we had a

117
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,069
whole group of breeders at the booth all

118
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,870
weekend long it was a great time it was

119
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:19,250
my first time finding in a booth and I

120
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,530
honestly thought that it was going to be

121
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,209
really stressful but parking was the

122
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,619
hardest part and once he got parked all

123
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:28,159
you had to do is carry your [Â __Â ] in and

124
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,780
it all happened on its own the endo Expo

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,550
moves all around the country and does

126
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:33,409
shows every few months and this was

127
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,079
their tenth show so they've gotten

128
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,250
really good at organizing the event

129
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,539
everyone knows where to go everybody

130
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,069
knows where to be so it's not super

131
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,379
confusing like some of the cannabis

132
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,779
events tend to be so that was great so

133
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:46,490
loading in was super easy I started

134
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:48,799
meeting people and making friends at 8

135
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,569
a.m. Saturday morning we didn't get

136
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,009
loaded into the building before people

137
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,409
started coming up and asking questions

138
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,300
and introducing themselves I didn't

139
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,040
waste any time I got right to business

140
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,670
and right in action started shaking

141
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,890
hands I saw a lot of wonderful people

142
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,020
this weekend at the endo Expo let's get

143
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:07,759
into that part I saw a lot of old

144
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:09,349
friends there are some folks I only get

145
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,849
to see it endo Expos there are some

146
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,160
folks I only get to see it industry

147
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,810
events I miss a lot of those folks and

148
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,550
it is a great time seeing all of your

149
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,189
smiling faces so I really enjoyed that

150
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,949
part of the endo Expo being stuck at a

151
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:23,569
booth I didn't get to travel around

152
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,399
Saturday I left my booth one time to go

153
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:27,800
hit the men's room and it honestly took

154
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,529
me way too long to get away from my

155
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,509
booth to the men's room and back because

156
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:35,059
being a member of the Colorado cannabis

157
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:37,099
community at a cannabis event I was

158
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,569
quite popular I'm not trying to say I'm

159
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,490
popular but I know a lot of people at

160
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,180
that venue and it took me a really long

161
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,370
time

162
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,840
to get from my booth to the men's room

163
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,819
and back I didn't want to be away from

164
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:48,918
my booth for that long I felt like an

165
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:50,300
abandoned ship my logo my I read

166
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:52,008
genetics flag is hanging up on the wall

167
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,500
and I'm not there I don't like that

168
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,150
feeling so Saturday I was away for maybe

169
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,459
20 minutes to go use the restroom and

170
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,319
get right back then Sunday I didn't even

171
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,519
leave my booth I had no reason to take

172
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,019
off from the booth I didn't have an

173
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,788
opportunity to eat or drink anything

174
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:06,680
because the booth was so busy so

175
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:08,930
honestly there was no need to use the

176
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,639
restroom so what I'm getting at is I was

177
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,918
at my booth the entire time the entire

178
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,769
weekend and the good part about that is

179
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,598
everybody knew where to find me I posted

180
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,399

00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:03,349
that he saw a measurable amount of new

294
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:05,479
subscribers because of my shout out and

295
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,250
I think it was really respectful that he

296
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,360
walked up and shook my hand and thanked

297

307
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:30,499

328
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,249
equipment in fact in a future episode

329
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,438
I've got a minder unit to give away to a

330
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:20,480
podcast listener so stay tuned for

331
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:22,399
details on that but it was great to

332
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,199
finally meet my friends that we have

333
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,909
supported each other for a long time and

334
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:27,588
they actually told me that they would

335
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:29,238
not have made it this far in their

336
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,639
company they certainly would not have

337
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:33,619
made it to the Indo Expo if it were not

338
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,360
for the support of myself and the Grove

339
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,918
from your heart podcast which means the

340
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,808
support from you folks that listen to

341
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:40,639
the show so it was great to finally

342
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:42,918
shake hands and get a hug and take a

343
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,688

that is a great way to segue into my

350
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:59,058
next part of this podcast I want to talk

351
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:00,949
about the endo Expo I didn't get to see

352
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:02,868
much of the endo Expo because I was at

353
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:05,238
my booth the entire time I've mentioned

354
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:07,639
that before I spent the entire day at my

355
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:09,470
booth interacting with consumers it was

356
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,600
a great time I got to teach a lot about

357
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,709
cannabis I got to teach everybody about

358
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
I read genetics

359
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,788
I had a great debate about feminized

360
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,369
seeds I got to meet a lot of great

361
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:21,740
breeders I shared a booth with always be

362
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:23,509
flowering with med tree seeds

363
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,950
there were several other experienced and

364
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:26,960
great breeders that pass through our

365
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,820
booth and came and said hi so that led

366
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,889
to a lot of great conversation and a lot

367
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,780
of great introductions so that was a

368
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:35,269
great time however I wish I would have

369
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,370
gotten to see a little bit of the expo I

370
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:39,769
did see a little bit and from what I saw

371
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,899
there were a lot of seed vendors and

372
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,909
seed breeders from what I was told there

373
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:47,689
were over 20 I think we counted at least

374
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:49,850
23 seed sellers at the expo I know that

375
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,710
exotic genetics was there I know Kappa

376
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,170
later was there our booth was right down

377
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,570
the row from Brothers Grimm who is mr.

378
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:59,059
soll ethos genetics had a giant booth

379
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,160
there were a lot of seed sellers and

380
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:03,799
vendors there another thing that was

381
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,659
really popular at the endo Expo was LED

382
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:08,059
lighting another thing I saw a whole

383
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:09,679
bunch of was Auto trimming machines

384
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:11,539
which I'm not a fan of but they were

385
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,269
there I'm just telling you what I saw a

386
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:17,000
lot of Auto trimming machines also a lot

387
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:19,340
of extraction equipment something that

388
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,149
was really huge this year at endo Expo

389
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,560
was heme seed and CBD many of the people

390
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,659
that approached my booth on the first

391
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,909
day were from out of state and they were

392
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,829
looking for bulk hemp seed that they

393
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:33,679
could take home and start farming hemp

394
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:36,050
the other thing that was huge was CBD

395
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,539
last year there was an area known as the

396
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:40,729
hemp hallway and that hallway had all of

397
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:44,360
the hemp vendors this year there was the

398
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:46,940
hemp and CBD pavilion a large portion of

399
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,120
the Indo Expo Center was dedicated just

400
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,520
to hemp and CBD products you could find

401
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,549
anything with CBD in this area there

402
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:58,250
were dog treats with CBD in it I tasted

403
00:14:55,549 --> 00:15:01,519
some amazing maple syrup that had CBD in

404
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,769
it there was CBD icecream there Reseda

405
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,769
SAVs and rubs there were CBD

406
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,779
concentrates available in that area

407
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:11,509
anything you could imagine to put CBD

408
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:14,569
into was available in that hip and CBD

409
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:16,370
Pavilion at the endo Expo this year so

410
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,770
even though I didn't get to see a large

411
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,750
portion of the endo Expo I still had the

412
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,490
time of my life this was my favorite

413
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,289
endo Expo I honestly thought it was

414
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,940
going to be stressful I thought that

415
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:27,799
running the booth may give me a little

416
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,050
bit of anxiety but honestly it went

417
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,309
super smoothly it went without a hitch I

418
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:32,959
couldn't have asked for a better time

419
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:35,259
and I honestly had the time of my life

420
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,910
so I want to give a huge shout out

421
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:39,460
again to everybody that came and said

422
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:40,779
hello everybody that high-fived me even

423
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,280
if you just kind of walked by the booth

424
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,139
and you just gave me that little head

425
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,639
nod that people do or the big eyes or

426
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:47,350
maybe you threw up a peace sign or maybe

427
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,120
you did a little fist bump across the

428
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,680
way if you said what's up to me at endo

429
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,029
expo what's up thanks for the love and

430
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,799
support if you came to the booth and

431
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:55,419
shook my hand if you walked away with

432
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,490
some gifts or if you walked away with a

433
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:58,929

434

438
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:09,219
my face from all of the fun I had at the

439
