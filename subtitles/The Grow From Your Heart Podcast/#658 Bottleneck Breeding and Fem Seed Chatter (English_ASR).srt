apologize you may hear

77
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,079
the air conditioner rattling in the

78
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,519
background uh it is approximately eight

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,760
o'clock as i am recording

80
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,759
and it is approximately 90 degrees

81
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,439
outside it has taken me all day

82
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,039
to get this space cool and comfortable

83
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,400
for recording

84
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,079
i'm not turning off that air i'm going

85
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,840
to let it just keep on going until it is

86
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,040
almost cold until it's uncomfortably

87
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,719
cold and then we'll turn it down a

88
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,239
little bit and let it readjust but

89
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,680
i'm grateful that it has cooled down a

90
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,039
little bit and i'm not turning it off so

91
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,439

92
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,959
of

93
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,719
background noises that's just the air

94
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,759
conditioner don't worry about it

95
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,439

144

145
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,959
will come from that

146
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,519

152
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,959
diesel

153
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,479
that straight diesel feel chemicals

154
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,399
nasty funk

155
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,680
almost an aroma that kind of burns your

156
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,959
eyes it's kind of if

157
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,959
somebody's got a bag of that in their

158
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,638
pocket and they get in the car your nose

159
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,399
starts to crinkle you go

160
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
man you got that sour diesel on you and

161
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,079
then your eyes start to feel it and then

162
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,560
as soon as i smoke sour diesel flowers

163
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,519
i feel it in my eyes in my head and i

164
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
love it

165
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,399
one random note about the sour diesel i

166
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,080
do not enjoy sour diesel concentrates

167
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,679
it just doesn't transfer it doesn't

168
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,758
translate in my opinion something

169
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,038
happens when you make a concentrate

170
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,360
that chemically skunky uh

171
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,199
diesel flavor doesn't come through the

172
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,720
way it should in a concentrate most of

173
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,079
the time that is just my opinion i've

174
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
never really enjoyed i love

175
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,599
the flowers i love a good sour diesel

176
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,399
flower

177
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,759
never been a big fan of any sour diesel

178
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,439
concentrates there's just something i've

179
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,680
really noticed along the way

180
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,519
let me get back on track so we've got a

181
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,759
sour diesel east coast sour diesel

182
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,000
crossed to a blueberry f4

183
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,840
that's going to be blueberry diesel

184
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,759
terps that's going to be crazy amazing

185
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,319
delicious good i can imagine only a good

186
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,879
buzz from anything dj short puts out

187
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,399
dj shorts a great breeder let me make a

188
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,279
side note i am honored that you're

189
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,758
choosing to use

190
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,679
one of my strains to breed to one of dj

191
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,680
strains because dj honestly is

192
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,519
uh one of my heroes without dj short

193
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,959
there wouldn't be an irie genetics he is

194
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,719
uh one of the godfathers one of the

195
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,599
pioneers one of the founders of cannabis

196
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
breeding

197
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,919
he taught me not directly his books his

198
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,439
teachings his podcast appearances

199
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,198
uh his books mainly a lot of [ __ ] that

200
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,719
he has said in magazines and books

201
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
have taught me a lot of things and a lot

202
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
of ideas and have been springboards

203
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,400
for ideas and tricks that i've learned

204
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,719
up to where i am now so

205
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,478
without dj i wouldn't be where i am i

206
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,919
read genetics wouldn't exist roster jeff

207
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,240
wouldn't be where we are so

208
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,918
big shout out big salute to dj short and

209
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
thank you for choosing to breed my

210
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,599
scarlet to some dj short work that's

211
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,680
[ __ ] awesome now let's get back on

212
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
some sort of track here you're going to

213
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,038
breed the scarlet begonias to the dj

214
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,360
shorts navy cross

215
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,560
male then it says now to make the

216
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,479
strains stable

217
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
do you keep finding the winners and

218
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,360
inbreeding them

219
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,360
um in short form it's not inbreeding it

220
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,038
is uh filial breeding it's breeding for

221
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,919
the next generation but technically what

222
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,318
you said

223
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,079
is what you want to do yes but when you

224
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
say inbreeding that implies that you are

225
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,439
going to take

226
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,279
one of the seeds that you made and breed

227
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,719
it to one of the parent plants and that

228
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,359
would be a back cross

229
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
a bc or a bx if you want to make pete's

230
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,240
head explode

231
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
that would be a back cross so what you

232
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,879
want to do you're on the right path you

233
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,199
want to

234
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,000
or what is done too stable and what is

235
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,879
your what do you mean

236
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,879
by stable i see a lot of people say that

237
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,719
plant is not stable and they mean that

238
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,240
it's got tendencies to have problems or

239
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,000
it's got this or it does that

240
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,759
stable just means do the plants look

241
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
uniform when you grow out a population

242
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,960
of seeds

243
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,839
how uniform do they look are they stable

244
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,680
are the

245
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,119
phenotypes stable that's what we want to

246
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,240
talk about so that's what i think you're

247
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,680
aiming for

248
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,160
how do we make them stable sometimes

249
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
that first f1 you're going to get pretty

250
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,319
stable

251
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
crosses you're going to identify you'll

252
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,598
be able to identify the phenotypes

253
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,758
you'll see what you've made you'll know

254
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,918
what you're working with um

255
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,840
now you've got that f1 batch of seeds or

256
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,439
actually it's technically a poly hybrid

257
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,719
but we're going to call this an f1 batch

258
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,160
of seeds so you've taken

259
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,080
your scarlet begonias you have

260
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,240
pollinated with the

261
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,359
navy cross you've got a batch of seeds

262
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,478
you want to make them

263
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,319
stable you find a male and a female from

264
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,279
that batch of seeds that are the winners

265
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,598
like you said

266
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,119
that have traits which you are looking

267
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,000
for now here is where we talk about the

268
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,399
breeding part

269
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,639
which i always like to step in with what

270
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,198
is your goal breeding is all about your

271
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,800
goal

272
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,478
these are two great plants to cross i

273
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,079
could see why it would be a good idea

274
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,800
but i can't see the plants which you

275
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,719
have chosen to cross what is the reason

276
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,520
what is the goal what is the desired

277
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
outcome

278
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,439
is there something about the scarlet

279
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,120
begonias you love what about the dj

280
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
short plant that you really love are you

281
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,719
trying to correct something you trying

282
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,240
to upgrade something are you chasing

283
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,080
a trait from one are you trying to

284
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,158
combine traits to from one

285
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,080
and the other to make one plant what is

286
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,439
your ultimate goal here

287
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,800
document that goal then do the cross

288
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,160
then grow out those seeds find if you've

289
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,399
met your goal do

290
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,480
a certain percentage of the seeds you

291
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,519
made hit the goal you're looking for are

292
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
they better

293
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,120
than both parent plants do they look

294
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
smell taste grow appear

295
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,278
perform the way you expected anticipated

296
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,240
and hope those plants would

297
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,439
if so you're mostly successful so far if

298
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,799
not then you're not you're not

299
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
successful you didn't make a good cross

300
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,759
you may have to just either pick another

301
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,800
male plant out of the pack pick a

302
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,799
different phenotype

303
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,039
uh start all over or just abandon the

304
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,958
project altogether so set a goal what is

305
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,199
your desired goal

306
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,119
what traits are you looking for so grow

307
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,040
out these seeds find a female plant that

308
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,959
holds the traits you are looking for

309
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,079
find a male plant that holds the traits

310
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,838
you are looking for

311
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,278
and cross those again and then guess

312
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
what you're going to get seeds out of

313
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:37,919
those

314
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,519
we're going to do it again find a female

315
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,958
that holds the traits you're looking for

316
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,839
find a male that holds the traits you're

317
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,000
looking for

318
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,399
and cross it again every time you do it

319
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,559
you should be working on stabilization

320
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,320
and uniformity of the progeny of the

321
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,639
offspring of the phenotypes they should

322
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,399
look

323
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,639
similar each time you do this they

324
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,799
should get closer and closer and closer

325
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,879
the first time you do the cross you're

326
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,199
gonna get like probably you'll see

327
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,559
somewhere between three maybe five maybe

328
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,079
seven or eight different phenotypes

329
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,119
depending on the parent plants you use

330
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,519
it just depends on

331
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,600
how their genetics breed together you're

332
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,240
gonna see multiple phenotypes

333
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,000
when you do the f2 you're gonna see we

334
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
call it the pandora's box you're gonna

335
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,679
open up

336
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:20,000
a lot of stuff you're going to see um

337
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,599
plants that are a lot the mommy plants

338
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,958
that are a lot the daddy plants are a

339
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,879
little bit mommy and daddy but then

340
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,319
you're also going to see grandparents on

341
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,559
both sides of that cross

342
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,240
appear in the progeny it's going to be

343
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,919
very fun it's really unique it's a

344
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,959
little bit frustrating sometimes to work

345
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,000
with the f2

346
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:38,479
uh population so now it's your job

347
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,320
to select the proper male and female out

348
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
of that f2 population breed them

349
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,000
together and make the f3

350
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
now these are going to be if you've done

351
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,159
your selection properly these will be

352
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
more uniform they'll start getting more

353
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,278
stable as the word that you're using

354
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,560
they'll start looking more uniform more

355
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,639
familiar

356
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,919
get your f3s find the seeds that look

357
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,199
beautiful that do what you want the

358
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,679
plants to do what you want

359
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,240
and cross those so that is you're going

360
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,319
to f4 by the time you get to f4 f5

361
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,919
you're really looking at uniform plants

362
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
dj stops at four or five

363
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,519
most of the time and he says that is to

364
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
give you some room to work with it if

365
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,000
you choose to breed with it

366
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,480
if you breed uh with a plant that is an

367
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,639
f4

368
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,560
or an f5 it's going to be very dominant

369
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,919
in your mix it's going to be like adding

370
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,759
too much hot sauce it's just going to

371
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,278
overpower everything everything will be

372
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,240
spicy at that point

373
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,720
so the easiest way the main way to do

374
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
this

375
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,120
is to keep going forward with filial

376
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,079
generations and stabilize

377
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,679
by uh selection by finding the traits

378
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,278
you want and selecting parent plants

379
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,799
that perform and do the things you need

380
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,360
and crossing them so if you

381
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,078
select pot properly on keep going

382
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,079
forward you

383
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,399
will make them stable it's just all

384
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,039
about selection from population

385
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,559
um what becomes challenging with that is

386
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,000
sometimes you see outliers and you want

387
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,278
to play with the outliers do i want to

388
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,720
breed with the one that looks just like

389
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,078
i wanted to play with or do i want to

390
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
breed to that [ __ ] weirdo there's

391
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,039
nothing stopping you from pollinating

392
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
both of those plants and doing two

393
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,639
separate lines and playing with it

394
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,719
now that i said two separate lines let's

395
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,799
talk about a totally different process

396
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,839
of doing this

397
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,679
i don't know what your goal is but maybe

398
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,079
uh maybe you want the flavor

399
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,000
of the blueberry diesel and maybe you

400
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,599
want the potency of the scarlet begonias

401
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
i'm just making up traits and ideas for

402
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,800
the sake of a podcast just to have a

403
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,240
springboard to talk about here

404
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,240
so you want one tree i forgot what i

405
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,519
even said now you want the the potency

406
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,839
of the scarlet begonias

407
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,600
and the flavors and aromas of the sauer

408
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,800
diesel blueberry cross the

409
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,360
navy navy cross so

410
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,159
you could in theory you could keep

411
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,919
crossing

412
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,759
male and female and male and female and

413
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,599
keep hoping you get that potency and

414
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,360
that flavor keep hoping you get those

415
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
traits find the female that's got both

416
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,759
of those

417
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,039
and keep crossing and keep crossing

418
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,399
further and further until you've

419
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,919
stabilized it

420
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,000
or here's another idea you can breed two

421
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,319
separate lines you can breed

422
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,839
the same this is the same cross so you

423
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,480
take the scarlet begonias

424
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,279
you take your uh navy cross and you make

425
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
seeds

426
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,320
now you find the male and female that

427
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,119
you like that have

428
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,399
the flavor the female's got the flavor

429
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
you're looking for

430
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,519
and the male has got it's got the aromas

431
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,040
it's going to work good for breeding and

432
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,959
you cross it to that female

433
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,679
and you make the flavor profile and then

434
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,759
you f2 that for flavor and f3 that

435
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,000
focused on flavor the whole time all the

436
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,799
way up to f4 or f5

437
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,159
and focus on just flavor you need a good

438
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,199
grower you need a good structure you

439
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,199
need a good shape

440
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,879
but the main focus right now is whatever

441
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,519
that flavor you're after

442
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,159
focus in on that i'm going to say

443
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,000
blueberry

444
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,519
diesel i can almost smell what a

445
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
blueberry diesel i've smoked blueberry

446
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,679
headband it's probably quite similar

447
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,278
that gassiness with a sweet blueberry to

448
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,638
it with that fake blueberry muffin

449
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,639
flavor on the exhale

450
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
i can get that in my mind so we're

451
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,039
searching for that terp

452
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,759
on the blueberry side of the cross now

453
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,000
let's get

454
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,360
a totally different batch of seeds the

455
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,958
same batch of seeds but a different

456
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,120
selection of seeds

457
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,239
and we're pulling out a male and female

458
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,399
that breed for

459
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,519
nothing but potency like they don't

460
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,440
taste super good

461
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,360
they don't yield super fat but it is

462
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,959
potent every time you smoke it

463
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,639
you got to call your mom you got to be

464
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,159
like bro i'm too [ __ ] high i can't

465
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,720
find my keys and the keys are in your

466
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,919
hand

467
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,440
like it's one of those looking for your

468
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,360
sunglasses where you're [ __ ] wearing

469
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,199
them i gotta turn down the music so that

470
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,919
you could see the street signs better

471
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,278
that kind of weed so breed for potency

472
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,399
and then just go f2

473
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,320
potency f3 potency f4 potency

474
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
and then by the time you get to f4 f5

475
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,399
you've just bred these plants that every

476
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,839
seed just makes highly ridiculously

477
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,120
potent [ __ ] plants

478
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,560
so now on side a you have still got uh

479
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,159
scarlet begonias cross to navy cross on

480
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,000
the other side you've still got scarlet

481
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,480
begonias crossed a navy cross but

482
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,480
one line is nothing but terps and the

483
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
other side is nothing but potency

484
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,320
now guess what we get to do we get to

485
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,360
find the correct progeny from

486
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,680
each line and cross those and then we

487
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,919
get the amazing terps and the amazing

488
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:04,159
potency and that is when we've got a

489
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:06,719
true f1 hybrid that is when a true f1

490
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,240
is achieved at that point earlier i said

491
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,360
that we're playing with poly hybrids

492
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,919
that is a good way

493
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,039
to wrap back to the poly hybrid part

494
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,958
until you

495
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,319
work it and stabilize it in such a

496
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,638
manner it is

497
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,959
just a polyhybrid at this point is a

498
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,879
true f1 you've worked the two lines for

499
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,719
desired specific traits with a very

500
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,759
specific goal in mind and then you have

501
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,879
crossed the two

502
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,439
in the end it is really a

503
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,559
long process it could be a lifeline a

504
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,959
lifetime

505
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,719
project but there's no rush there's no

506
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,638
hurry to do this dj short

507
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,120
has been at this since he was a very

508
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,198
young man and he's my senior probably by

509
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,240
i'm gonna give him 10 years on me no no

510
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:45,519
disrespect dj

511
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
uh we respect you because you're our

512
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,078
elder i'm just saying dj's been at it

513
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,919
for a while

514
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,599
you've got your whole life to do it uh

515
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,519
don't try to fast track it

516
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,199
going fast will [ __ ] you up take your

517
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,600
time be patient

518
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,439
grow large numbers if you can a large

519
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,879
population will give you opportunity to

520
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,639
find the plants you're looking for you

521
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,000
can find the uniform plants you can find

522
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,000
the outliers

523
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,278
you'll start being very familiar with

524
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,559
them early

525
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,320
when they start growing if you grow

526
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,359
enough you'll go i don't even want these

527
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,120
plants and you'll just start calling

528
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,399
them you know these aren't for me

529
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
this is not for the mix and you'll just

530
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,600
start getting rid of it and then you'll

531
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,519
see it on both sides

532
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,199
you'll be really really good at culling

533
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,399
the plants that do not qualify for your

534
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,838
breeding project

535
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,039
all right so let me make sure i answered

536
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,399
all of that now to make the strain

537
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,078
stable do you keep finding the winners

538
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,720
and inbreeding them

539
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,319
inbreeding isn't the appropriate word

540
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,759
but you've got the right idea yes

541
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,519
you'll have a batch of seeds out of the

542
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,199
seeds find a male find a female

543
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,278
breed them together those will make more

544
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,958
seeds find a male find a female out of

545
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,320
those seeds and breed those together and

546
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,000
just keep going forward

547
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
if you want to do two separate breeding

548
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,278
projects to isolate traits and then

549
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,440
bring those together in the future

550
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,000
that is a really beautiful project to

551
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,759
really get a beautiful f1 hybrid

552
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,360
so you did use the word inbreeding which

553
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,800
isn't absolutely correct in this

554
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,079
situation i understand what you were

555
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,919
getting at but i'm just going to talk

556
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,679
about inbreeding briefly here

557
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,599
inbreeding is basically how we make a

558
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,240
back cross inbreeding would be

559
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,798
if we took any of the seeds and bred it

560
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,160
to the parent which it came from

561
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:14,558
in plant biology it's okay

562
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,079
to uh breed brothers and sisters

563
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,038
together it's okay to breed anything

564
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,480
together but

565
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,078
bringing brothers and sisters together

566
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,679
is more commonplace for moving the

567
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,078
generations forward

568
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,919
uh breeding a parent to one of the

569
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,359
children is actually a back cross and

570
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,080
it's done mainly

571
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,479
to uh stabilize something like the back

572
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,839
cross i would do that if i didn't have

573
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,440
if i wanted to make seeds of something

574
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,959
which i only had a female of and i've

575
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,679
talked about that plenty on other shows

576
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
but that is

577
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,919
that is inbreeding if you go uh a seed

578
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
back to one of its parents

579
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,840
is actually the inbreeding in cannabis

580
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,880
that can be done a lot of different ways

581
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,399
i just wanted to touch on what

582
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,400
inbreeding actually was since you did

583
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,080
use that word here in the message

584
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,519
all right i think i talked a lot about

585
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,399
that topic i hope i answered your

586
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,319
question

587
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,440
um i really do enjoy talking about

588
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,038
breeding so if you've got any more

589
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,759
breeding questions please do send them

590
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,079
to me

591
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,240
patreon.com forward slash grow from your

592
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,720
heart is the easiest method or

593
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,079
uh grow from your heart at hotmail.com

594
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
will get them to me as well

595
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,519
all right i do have another question

596
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,159
here in front of me also big shout out

597
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,519
to my buddy

598
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,960
slightly stoned stupid 42.

599
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,200
got another question this one came from

600
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,519
our friend red eye and it says i was

601
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,360
also thinking about reversed feminize to

602
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,359
feminized what would we be

603
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,798
expecting so this actually came from a

604
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,038
part of another conversation

605
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,480
i just kind of clipped out this part uh

606
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,558
feels unexplored

607
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,720
okay so basically what they're asking

608
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,839
about is if they crossed a reversed

609
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,960
feminized plant

610
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,240
to a feminized plant what would we be

611
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,720
expecting

612
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,960
basically this is just uh reversing a

613
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,679
female plant and crossing it to a female

614
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,240
plant

615
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,559
you can cross uh feminized plants to

616
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,200
non-feminized plants to regular plants

617
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,200
to

618
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,038
feminize to non however you want to do

619
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,519
it it is possible people ask me a lot of

620
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:57,440
times

621
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,879
is it okay to breed with feminized

622
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,558
plants yes absolutely

623
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,720
is it okay to keep a feminized plant as

624
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,918
a mother yes absolutely that is the same

625
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,319
thing as a non-femme

626
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,840
plant the only difference was back in

627
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,439
the the pollen stage

628
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,599
we determined that you would not get any

629
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,919
males it was the pollen there was a male

630
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,000
or a female that female pollen had a

631
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,840
female plant made female plants it's all

632
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,519
the same as any other plant except it

633
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,439
was guaranteed a female

634
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,879
a good way to think about it and mr soul

635
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
taught me this i'm not taking credit for

636
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,240
this analogy but think

637
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,519
about it when you make feminized seeds

638
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,279
basically we have learned

639
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,798
how to put up a filter and when the

640
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,839
males start shooting pollen we have

641
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:33,759
learned how to suck out

642
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,678
all of the male pollen out of the air

643
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,240
out of the equation so that only female

644
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,880
pollen

645
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,440
will land onto our female plants that is

646
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,120
not at

647
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
all how the process happens but it's a

648
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,959
very good analogy how to explain it the

649
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,839
only difference is the pollen we've

650
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,079
learned how to take

651
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,759
the male pollen out of the equation to

652
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,558
create all female seeds

653
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,319
so crossing reversed feminized to

654
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,599
feminized what would we be expecting

655
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,399
that is basically

656
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,918
uh making a self-plan the things to

657
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,480
think about that would be a variable

658
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,159
here

659
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,839
is are we reversing well it says a

660
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,039
reversed feminized too

661
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:10,399
feminized is it the same feminized plant

662
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,759
like a golden goat let's just say i grew

663
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,440
let's just say lemon jeffree that's a

664
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,240
better example just for where i want to

665
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
go with this

666
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,359
lemon jeffree is a feminized plant it's

667
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,320
not available in regular seeds at all

668
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,079
um let's say we use the painted lady cut

669
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,678
of lemon jeffrey she's got a beautiful

670
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,079
lemon jeffree cut so we take that

671
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,640
painted lady cut of lemon jeffrey

672
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,798
uh i reversed that one because it says a

673
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,799
a reversed feminize so i reverse it

674
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,839
treat it with silver thiosulfate it is

675
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,519
now making

676
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,918
female pollen do i pollinate that same

677
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,759
another cut of the same lemon jeffree at

678
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,240
that point we're just going to expect

679
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,119
more lemon jeffrey we have made an s1

680
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,798
that is a self

681
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,439
version of that lemon jeffree it's going

682
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,679
to make pretty close to copies

683
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,279
stable if you will copies of the

684
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,720
original lemon jeffree there will be

685
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,558
some differences you will see a little

686
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,839
bit of golden goat and some phenotypes

687
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,079
you will see a little bit of

688
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,480
the lemon skunk and some phenos most of

689
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,879
them are gonna look just like the mommy

690
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,640
that i use to recreate it because the

691
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,240
pollen donor and the pollen receiver

692
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,159
basically the mommy and daddy of this

693
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,159
plant were the same plant so it's gonna

694
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
look like this plant very much so much

695
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,240
of its genetics

696
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,919
mathematically are this plant you do

697
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,519
like i mentioned have the opportunity to

698
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,400
see that golden goat and to see that

699
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,879
lemon skunk

700
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,600
and also you're going to see weird

701
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,600
outliers that's just how genetics work

702
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,759
you're always going to get some weird

703
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,199
[ __ ] expected that is how genetics work

704
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,759
no matter how hard the breeding just

705
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,798
done

706
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,319
how much work is done nature loves to

707
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,558
throw you some weird [ __ ] and that's

708
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,158
nature's will to survive if we try to

709
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,599
control it too much that's when it

710
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,280
[ __ ] fights back and it's like oh you

711
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,038
think you got the breeding dialed in

712
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,720
watch this and then you get some weird

713
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:49,599
[ __ ] mutant plants you had no idea

714
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,960
we're gonna come out

715
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,959
so um reversed feminized to

716
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
feminized we took that lemon jeffrey we

717
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
reversed her we put her on more lemon

718
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,360
jeffrey

719
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:03,119
we have now made a lemon jeffrey s1

720
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,119
which is probably a little bit different

721
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,479
than just when you do the golden goat to

722
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,239
the lemon skunk you're gonna see

723
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,519
variation there if we take that just the

724
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,200
lemon jeffrey now

725
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,879
and reverse that one and hit the lemon

726
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,038
jeffrey again we're locking in those

727
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,039
lemon jeffree traits we've washed out

728
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,240
the opportunity to see lemon skunk and

729
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,319
golden goat a little bit

730
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,279
giving ourselves even more opportunity

731
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,759
to lock in

732
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,158
that lemon jeffrey trait so if we did

733
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,599
reverse feminize to feminized

734
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,039
what would we be expecting so we've

735
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,639
talked about if we pollinate the same

736
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,480
thing what if we pollinate

737
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,640
a different plant that is when we are

738
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,519
doing what i labeled what i was calling

739
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,000
at some point an

740
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,599
r1 or a reversal i will do an updated

741
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
podcast on those labels because i have

742
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,639
received

743
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,558
a lot of feedback on that um and yes

744
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,400
those were kind of terms made up by our

745
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,319
by our industry by somebody in our

746
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,200
industry but it works is why i tried to

747
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,158
go with it

748
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,360
um anyway if you put that reversed lemon

749
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,000
jeffrey pollen on

750
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,158
any other plant you are now making a new

751
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,440
cross and it's going to work just like

752
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,360
if you put any other pollen on

753
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,798
any other plant except it's going to be

754
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,879
all female

755
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,240
and you're going to see let's say i'm

756
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,840
just gonna pick a plant i have to pick a

757
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,159
plant to put this pollen on we're going

758
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,639
to put reversed lemon jeffrey pollen

759
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,000
on uh let's just put it on the chem de

760
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,080
la chem cause that sounds [ __ ]

761
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,960
amazing right lemon jeffrey to kem de la

762
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,199
cam

763
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,200
what it's not happening so don't get too

764
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,360
excited but it sounds [ __ ] beautiful

765
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,880
so now we've got the reversed lemon

766
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:30,079
jeffrey and we're putting it on

767
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,679
uh chem de la chem pollen or on a chem

768
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,480
daily chem female that wouldn't work

769
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,798
because that one's not

770
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,000
feminized they want to do to a feminized

771
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,000
so let's put that on

772
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,759
something feminized orange gasm let's

773
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,400
throw that on the orange gasm now you've

774
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,359
made

775
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,798
uh orange gasm cross two lemon jeffree

776
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,000
that is a new hybrid that's gonna be

777
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,000
lemon oranges

778
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,519
craziness unfortunately they both have

779
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,519
golden goat in the mix so you're gonna

780
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,038
get a lot of golden goat in the progeny

781
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:53,759
there but that wasn't that's beside the

782
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:55,038
point

783
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,558
the point here is that you're just going

784
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,839
to make a new hybrid it will be just

785
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,599
like if you were to put

786
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,278
any other plant in a room and pollinate

787
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,519
any other plant

788
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,640
but since you're using a feminized

789
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,798
starter plant

790
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,520
all of the offspring all the progeny all

791
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:12,879
of the seeds will be female

792
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,798
i'm gonna say that ah 99.9 percent of

793
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,559
them will be female because like i said

794
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,319
nature does love to [ __ ] with you no

795
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,839
matter how good the breeding is done

796
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:23,200
it is possible to find a male a full-on

797
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,199
nutty

798
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,720
intersex plant anything wrong i don't

799
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
know if i need to edit that word out or

800
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,519
not

801
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,640
um i may if you hear a bleep right there

802
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,158
you know what where to edit it out

803
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,799
because youtube may get on me for that

804
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
word

805
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,759
um uh it won't be an

806
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,759
intersex plant it won't have male and

807
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,919
female parts it will be a straight up

808
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,440
full-on male that is an opportunity to

809
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,480
come from feminized seeds

810
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,960
it is one in a million or one in

811
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,798
i'm going to say i don't know 100 000 or

812
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,840
something like that but it is possible

813
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:53,440
i've seen it happen

814
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,199
i know another breeder who has had it

815
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,759
happen i've seen a breeder

816
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
breed with a male that came from

817
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,079
feminized stock

818
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,640
and that makes a lot of females it does

819
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,158
put off

820
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,080
some male plants but most of the

821
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,760
offspring are female so

822
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,678
it is possible no matter how good the

823
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,519
breeding is done those plants are going

824
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,320
to do what they want just like jurassic

825
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,440
park bro

826
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,720
life does find a way

827
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,880
we can't do everything to make the

828
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,759
plants perfect every time we do our best

829
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,039
through selection

830
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,119
so um let's see where were we

831
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,720
crossing reversed to feminize we talked

832
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,599
about that or reverse feminize to

833
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,880
feminized

834
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,798
i wanted to talk about hitting the

835
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,520
reverse pollen to

836
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,119
a the same female to a different female

837
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,119
the same time you're making uh self

838
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,359
plants a second way you're just making

839
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,558
uh r1's reverse plant basically making

840
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,119
new hybrids

841
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,000
i think i answered that one unexplored

842
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,918
had to try it

843
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,119
uh not very unexplored all the breeders

844
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,240
are doing that

845
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,839
um some people don't even realize that

846
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,919
what if you get a clone what if somebody

847
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,439
passes you a clone of lemon jeffrey and

848
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,278
you just decide to breed with it

849
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,360
you probably didn't even think if that

850
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,798
lemon jeffrey came from a feminized seed

851
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,558
stock you just have the clone you

852
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,639
probably don't even think about

853
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,319
if the original plant came from a femme

854
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,440
seed or a regular seed so a lot of

855
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,960
people are doing that

856
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,558
they're just out there breeding with

857
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,319
femme stock with reg stock and they're

858
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,599
not even thinking about it until this

859
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:14,158
episode now they're going to put thought

860
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,759
into it

861
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,360
they're going to [ __ ] everything up

862
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,558
because now they're aware of it they're

863
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,759
going to stumble over themselves and

864
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:21,359
trip over their own dicks that's just

865
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,519
how people get

866
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:26,158
but it's not very unexplored i've been

867
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,079
exploring it i got experience in there

868
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,919
um so crossing reverse feminize to

869
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,158
feminized you're just going to get

870
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,600
great feminized offspring if you do it

871
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,120
right you get great [ __ ]

872
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,399
if you do it to wonky plants that

873
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,119
haven't been tested if they have

874
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,440
problems

875
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,959
uh if they're prone to throw manners i'm

876
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,558
trying to avoid that one word i said a

877
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,000
moment ago the h word because we have a

878
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,000
friend who got their channel flagged for

879
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,759
saying that h word is hate speech

880
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,919
we're actually talking about intersex

881
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,000
plants here please don't flag us

882
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,679
uh but if they're prone to do that the

883
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,640
offspring will do that as well so be

884
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,840
careful with your

885
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,759
selection selection is key all right i

886
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,519
want to send a big thank you to my buddy

887
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,960
red eye thank you for the great question

888
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,000
i hope i answered you because i feel

889
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,319
like i got

890
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
super rambly all right i've got another

891
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,759
great email here in front of me

892
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,278
let's not ramble too much let's get

893
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,798
right into this one

894
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,720
oh that's not the one we need for the

895
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,480
show actually here

896
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,159
is it's on the bottom of course here is

897
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,919
the one i wanted to read on

898
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,320
this episode i'm not going to read the

899
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,240
whole message because it is

900
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,759
uh quite long and we can get to the

901
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,599
point kind of quickly here without

902
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,558
reading all of this this one came from

903
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,199

genetics

906
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,720
website there is a grow help tab on the

907
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,879
ire genetics website if you go to

908
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,558
iregenetics.com

909
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,320
you will see the grow help tab click on

910
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,480
there we ask you a few

911
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,158
a few preliminary questions we ask you

getting their message read here we ask

917
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,640
you what strain you're growing why

918
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,640
you're growing it what kind of lights

919
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,038
just a few basic questions to help me

920
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,520
help you so let's get right into it

921
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:01,679
uh this one is from our buddy debo buds

922
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,000
they're growing a random seed indoor

923
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,240
under

924
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,038
led they're in flower they're five weeks

925
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,679
in

926
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,879
uh they their last feed was a five

927
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,320
gallon res

928
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,159
uh with 19 mils let's see

929
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,359
okay they've broken down every mil of

930
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,480
every nutrient we don't need to read all

931
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,038
that they're feeding

932
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,159
uh botanicare calmag advanced nutrients

933
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,720
sensei bloom

934
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,360
a and b bud blood a quarter scoop of

935
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,480
great white

936
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,359
uh ppm or ec of the last feeding 1200 i

937
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,798
think for

938
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,319
what you're putting in there that seems

939
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:30,798
a little bit low and for week five a

940
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,240
bloom

941
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:33,839
that's a little bit low there should be

942
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,599
a couple other things in here the

943
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,079
daytime temps are fine nighttime temps

944
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,599
are fine

945
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,439
no reports on humidity um

946
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,278
so i'm going to read part of this and we

947
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,038
may end up editing this because this is

948
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,720
kind of long we don't need to review all

949
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,240
of this here but it does go on to say

950
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,839
what's up you bad [ __ ] on my

951
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,319
last flower run which was my first

952
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,119
flower

953
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,879
ever during hydroponics i made several

954
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,319
mistakes yes that is going to happen but

955
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,440
owning up to those mistakes is very

956
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,599
important

957
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,840
it says at the time i was doing half

958
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,319
strength of the recommended feeding as i

959
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,759
as it was working well in veg so i

960
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,678
continued that same pattern when

961
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,720
flipping to flower all was well until

962
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,559
week five

963
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,079
so they're doing the recommendation a

964
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,839
lot of times we say

965
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,918
podcasters people who teach you about

966
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,000
growing we say that you only need to use

967
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,919
about half strength of what a nutrient

968
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,480
company recommends on the bottles

969
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,960
because

970
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,640
they do want you to buy more and you can

971
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,480
always add something to your plants but

972
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,000
you can't take nutrients out so start

973
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,720
off at half strength see what the plants

974
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,919
are doing

975
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,360
if they're responding like they're

976
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,640
hungry if they want more of something

977
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,000
you can give it to them

978
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,080
but if they're acting like they're being

979
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,880
burnt or overfed then you know you need

980
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,879
to reduce it

981
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,320
start off weaker work your way up dial

982
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,760
it in figure it out from there

983
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,599
so our friend here was following good

984
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,398
advice going about it the right way they

985
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,398
were feeding

986
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,158
uh have strength nutrients and they were

987
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:51,839
happy with it the plant seemed happy

988
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,640
until week five it says uh then week

989
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,439
five

990
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,240
i let's see i noticed the ppm of the

991
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,480
runoff was

992
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,880
going up every day like they quit eating

993
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,440
so i added fresh 5.5 ph

994
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,039
water uh that water ph was way too low

995
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,120
you're pissing the plants off

996
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,278
only to top off the res midweek but the

997
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,199
runoff each day continued to climb

998
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,640
so after two days i dumped the res and

999
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,038
started to flush

1000
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,960
with ro with ro water with a ph of

1001
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:19,359
5.6 and then for the rest of the week i

1002
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,278
just

1003
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,759
watered with auro water at a regular

1004
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,880
cycle watching the ppm drop back down

1005
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,919
from 1200 to 1850 so you were getting a

1006
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,760
runoff

1007
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:34,000
of of 18.50

1008
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,759
okay i continued this for a week and

1009
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,038
never dropped under 1200 i called the

1010
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,158
manufacturer okay

1011
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,079
now i've got a couple of things to

1012
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,320
mention already um

1013
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,918
did the plants look okay we didn't talk

1014
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,558
about what the plants looked like you

1015
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,080
just said

1016
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,839
then in week five you notice that the

1017
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:51,439
ppms were way

1018
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,558
off um you don't mention that the plants

1019
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,640
looked upset

1020
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,480
are you growing ph meters are you

1021
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,159
growing ec meters or are we growing

1022
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,399
plants if the plants looked angry you

1023
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,080
didn't include that here so i don't know

1024
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,000
but if you're just changing things up

1025
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,879
and doing random chaotic [ __ ] to your

1026
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,038
plants

1027
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,559
because of a meter and the plants didn't

1028
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,720
say anything about it

1029
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,398
don't do that don't do that the plants

1030
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,919
are the boss we're not growing meters

1031
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,199
we're not growing monitors we're not

1032
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,480
growing programs

1033
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,919
we're not trying to make the [ __ ]

1034
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,240
charts happy we're trying to make the

1035
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,519
plants happy i love all of my toys my

1036
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,640
equipment my meters

1037
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,200
it makes life easy but those aren't

1038
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,080
what i paid the most attention to i pay

1039
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,240
attention to

1040
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,079
the plants i know what the plants need i

1041
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,159
watch the plants do they look happy

1042
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,398
then i make a mental note of what

1043
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,000
parameters those plants enjoy

1044
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,719
i know that these plants like it about

1045
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,398
82 degrees they like it about 60

1046
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,839
relative humidity they like a little bit

1047
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:45,359
of wind in here they like it when i

1048
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,199
water them this often

1049
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,439
so then i set up devices that will tell

1050
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,360
me when those parameters are being met

1051
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,200
or when they are not being met i don't

1052
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,000
pay too much attention to the room to

1053
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,000
the equipment

1054
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,679
to the runoff to the ph coming out of

1055
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,519
the plant i watch

1056
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,200
the plants and if they're angry they'll

1057
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,440
tell me and then i can start

1058
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,798
checking my monitors my meters looking

1059
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640
at reports i can see

1060
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,000
oh a couple of days ago it got really

1061
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
hot in here and i can see that today

1062
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,359
they're acting a little bit goofy or

1063
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,558
a few days ago the runoff on the ph was

1064
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,240
a little bit high and now they're acting

1065
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:15,759
goofy now we can react

1066
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,200
i don't look at runoff numbers and say

1067
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,000
the numbers are wrong we have to change

1068
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,600
something

1069
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,519
as soon as you start doing that you [ __ ]

1070
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,558
up the plants watch the plants they will

1071
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,558
tell you

1072
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,000
so that is the main thing to start with

1073
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:27,599
um

1074
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,960
yeah you don't mention that the plants

1075
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,240
were mad you just say that the numbers

1076
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,759
were wrong so you changed it then you

1077
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,640
said you called the manufacturer in tech

1078
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,960
support

1079
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,320
and got reprimanded for only using half

1080
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,240
of what they recommend

1081
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,558
my notes on my page straight up say [ __ ]

1082
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,319
that guy if somebody reprimanded you for

1083
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,158
using their product the wrong way

1084
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,319
[ __ ] that guy and again i've only got to

1085
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,440
go by what you said and you said they

1086
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,200
reprimanded you so

1087
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,480
my if i called a company and i was like

1088
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,919
hey i need help with your product and

1089
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,000
they reprimanded me

1090
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,360
i'd [ __ ] that company i would never give

1091
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,038
them another dollar

1092
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,639
of my hard-earned money they wouldn't

1093
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,158
even hear from me they wouldn't even

1094
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,840
i wouldn't even take the energy to talk

1095
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,000
[ __ ] about them on a podcast they i

1096
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:06,000
would just forget they even existed

1097
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,679
and the brand you're talking about until

1098
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,440
you brought them up i basically forgot

1099
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,360
they existed anyway

1100
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,278
let's keep moving so dude don't let a

1101
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,798
nutrient company reprimand you for doing

1102
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,319
anything wrong if they had good quality

1103
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,720
customer service

1104
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,558
they would they what they should do is

1105
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,319
take you by your hand and guide you

1106
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:23,678
through it and do it the proper way that

1107
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,439
is their job if they want to call

1108
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,240
themselves customer service that is the

1109
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,840
way to do it

1110
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,519
what they did was a dick move that

1111
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,319
wasn't cool at all that is not customer

1112
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,558
service that's

1113
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,599
uh that's an ego problem uh that's

1114
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,038
that's yeah it's

1115
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,359
being a control freak and having an ego

1116
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:39,119
problem if you want somebody to

1117
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,879
use your product you don't reprimand

1118
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,398
them i don't think you should reprimand

1119
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,440
them if i wanted if you were

1120
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,518

1121
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,880
product isn't working i'd say well let's

1122
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,399

1123
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,919
with you and we talk about what did you

1124
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,278
do well here's where you went wrong

1125
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,720

1126
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,038

1128
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,839
like that's not the way [ __ ] works so i

1129
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,600
hope you don't give them any more of

1130
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,319
your money abandon ship with those guys

1131
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,678
is my uh

1132
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,079
vote with your dollars is what scotty

1133
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,559
real would tell us so it goes on

1134
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,000
uh but man i think i've answered most of

1135
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,119
your questions really dude i'm gonna

1136
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,838
read a little bit more of this but

1137
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,399
honestly

1138
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,239
uh one of your mistakes was adjusting

1139
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,838
due to numbers don't adjust due to

1140
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,759
numbers the bottom line is the plants

1141
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:18,799
are the boss in this whole situation not

1142
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,879
the investors

1143
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,079
not the owner of the facility not the

1144
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,480
irs guy

1145
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,320
not city planning and zoning not the

1146
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,838
consultant not the lead grower not the

1147
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,720
grow tech not the trimmer

1148
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,320
not the uh the compliance person none of

1149
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,000
those people are the boss they all like

1150
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,079
to think they are we all like to think

1151
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,280
we are the plants are the boss the

1152
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,519
plants dictate

1153
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,960
everything in that place uh you should

1154
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,759
make a schedule for the plants and you

1155
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,199
should have some

1156
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,480
some stuff like that they can't write

1157
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,678
the rules and the schedules and they

1158
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,320
can't go get food

1159
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,079
but they are the boss so let them be the

1160
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,760
boss i do want to read more of this

1161
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,159
uh but when you said you got reprimanded

1162
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,760
dude that's frustrating don't ever let a

1163
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,960
manufacturer reprimand you you should

1164
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,640
call them back and tell them that rosta

1165
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,240
jeff said to go [ __ ] yourself

1166
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,078
uh then since i didn't think it was

1167
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,759
right either but i'm not gonna argue

1168
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,960
with them i'm still learning okay so

1169
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,520
they did tell you to use it full

1170
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,800
strength

1171
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,280
i'm learning i didn't know better than

1172
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,960
them uh then the ppm stayed high

1173
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,480
then they started to drop again and the

1174
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,838
plants are now showing sign of flushing

1175
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,960
well yeah you've been doing so much to

1176
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,960
them now that those plants are just

1177
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,480
going to be angry you're in

1178
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,320
if you're in any sort of hydro like that

1179
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,159
they they do uh they

1180
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,680
show you results very quickly and you've

1181
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,319
done a lot to them so they've been beat

1182
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,440
up

1183
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,760
um i'm already let's see figured i'd

1184
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,079
switch

1185
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,359
ppm to ec on the next run oh yeah using

1186
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,720
a different scale may i mess you all up

1187
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:34,159
too when i check the trichomes during

1188
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,000
all this time they turn from clear to

1189
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,559
some milky and some seem to have stalled

1190
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,199
out

1191
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,639
your plants are confused yes i'm going

1192
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,759
to read more of this to myself really

1193
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,960
quickly and we'll see if we can help you

1194
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,560
out anymore or if we've covered the

1195
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,720
important parts harvested

1196
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,078
time to move on sometimes that's the

1197
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,399
best way to do it dude

1198
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,720
cut it down and take note of what you

1199
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,720
did and learn from it and know what to

1200
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,399
do and what not to do next time

1201
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,759
a lot of learning is learning what not

1202
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,680
to do next time you

1203
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,640
if you get everything right every time

1204
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,000
think about it like if you're a

1205
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,279
skateboarder or if you're doing some

1206
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,519
extreme sport you're out there on a

1207
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,200
[ __ ] freestyle bike or a motorcycle

1208
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,800
if you nail the trick the first time

1209
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,078
every time you're never gonna learn

1210
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,440
anything you're gonna get a big head

1211
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,720
you're gonna get a big ego

1212
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,838
and then when it comes time to perform

1213
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,879
in the x games you're going to get

1214
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,159
nervous and you're not going to be able

1215
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,400
to do the basic tricks because you've

1216
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:22,078
been out there doing stalefish 360s

1217
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,079
can't even [ __ ] kick flip right so um

1218
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,440
yeah learn you got to learn from your

1219
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,960
mistakes crash and burn and hurt

1220
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,200
yourself is where i was trying to head

1221
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
uh fall down get some road rash break a

1222
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,078
couple bones and then you'll learn

1223
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,199
i don't need to do that [ __ ] again and

1224
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,400
you'll learn that i gotta put my foot

1225
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,919
here i gotta put my foot here and you'll

1226
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,680
start landing your tricks that's where i

1227
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,760
was trying to go with all that nonsense

1228
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,799
um there's a lot to this message but

1229
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,160
you've harvested

1230
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,880
uh this message came in a while back um

1231
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,759
my main point of this dude is uh don't

1232
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,440
grow meters

1233
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,599
don't adjust too much to the meters and

1234
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,440
then don't ever let a nutrient company

1235
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,480
representative talk down to you

1236
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,039
i don't know who you are uh but nobody

1237
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,719
should ever reprimand you nobody maybe

1238
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,599
your mama or daddy but that's the only

1239
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,159
person's

1240
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,480
um maybe you're married too sorry uh

1241
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,838
let's see

1242
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,519
oh i don't have page two of this anyway

1243
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:10,880
there was a second page to this but i

1244
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,400
feel like i have answered most of this

1245
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,519
question this one actually came to us

1246
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,519
quite a while ago so

1247
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,039
uh that crop has been harvested i did

1248
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,039
want to make sure to read that because

1249
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,880
when you said you were reprimanded by

1250
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,000
the representative of that grow company

1251
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,519
it definitely uh

1252
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,199
it made me frustrated so i want to come

1253
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,719
on here and just make sure that you uh

1254
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,919
stand up for yourself next time

1255
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,199
and my main point is don't grow meters

1256
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,720
we're not growing meters we're not

1257
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,480
growing ec meters we're not growing i

1258
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,000
love all my toys don't get me wrong i

1259
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,079
always talk about that i know my friends

1260
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,358
that give me meters and make programs

1261
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,000
and stuff they're going come on use the

1262
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,920
meters

1263
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
i do but they're not the boss the plants

1264
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,720
are the boss the meters are what i use

1265
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,400
to uh as markers and indicators if i've

1266
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:49,279
got a problem then i go to the meters

1267
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,800
the plants say

1268
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,480
something's wrong i look at them i can

1269
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,359
usually identify a problem but i can use

1270
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,000
the meters

1271
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,598
the programs the notes to kind of back

1272
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,119
up my claims if i have to go to

1273
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,720
a facility owner and say hey i think

1274
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,519
this is happening we need to spend money

1275
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,118
on this

1276
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:04,559
they say prove it and i go the plants

1277
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,480
show this the

1278
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,239
status shows this reports show this and

1279
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,920
this piece of equipment shows this

1280
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,598
i've isolated the problem to this they

1281
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,039
go that's good work we'll order the

1282
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,320
product you think i don't just go

1283
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,079
hey the plants are looking like this we

1284
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,280
gotta add calmag and they go oh

1285
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,960
how do you know that and i go because

1286
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,519
they're showing the little rusty spots

1287
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,880
dude

1288
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,920
they go no let's look at the reports

1289
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,200
let's look at some [ __ ] and let's

1290
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,920
[ __ ] back that claim up with

1291
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,319
something

1292
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,519
then we adjust the calmac all right i

1293
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,880
did want to make sure to get that one

1294
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,280
answered because it did come in quite a

1295
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,119
ways

1296
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,560
ago i feel like i rambled through that

1297
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,760
one quite a bit but

1298
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:35,279
one of your problems is that you're

1299
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,960
mixing brands it looks like you were

1300
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,160
doubling up on your base nutrients in

1301
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,199
this also

1302
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,118
um use a more reputable brand use a

1303
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,799
brand that didn't reprimand you

1304
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,160
i would recommend using new millennium

1305
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,440
bottled nutrients they don't pay me to

1306
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,960
say that but they're good people they've

1307
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,720
got great customer service

1308
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,480
uh and a lot of my teachings are based

1309
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,078
on using their products so if you're

1310
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,000
using them you can follow along very

1311
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,519
easily with me it's very easy to

1312
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
understand that way

1313
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,559
but don't let anyone reprimand you and

1314
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,079
uh

1315
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,000
grow from your heart watch the plants

1316
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,440
don't worry so much about the meters

1317
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,440
all right ladies and gentlemen boys
