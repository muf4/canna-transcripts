my eyes heavy i feel like my eyes are

64
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,040
i got some sort of weights on my eyelids

65
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,319
or something i feel like my brain is in

66
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,920
a little bit of a tunnel

67
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,199

109
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,319
long time since i've taken a dab

110
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,079
in a big group of people it has been a

111
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,919
weird year what are you gonna do this

now that people are getting vaccinated

116
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,719
now that the things are opening up

117
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
rules are changing people aren't so

118
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,400
paranoid is it going to be a different

119
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,079
year will 420 be different

120
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,840
i really don't know i haven't made any

121
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
plans yet i don't know what's going on

122
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
i'm not ready to go out into big crowds

123
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,519
yet

124
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,798
even if the uh the pandemic is chilled

125
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,920
out the virus has kind of

126
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,439
settled down a little bit and i don't

127
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,679
know i'm not getting political on that

128
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,438
even when that does kind of chill out

129
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,040
i'm still kind of worried about people

130
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,318
people are gonna be acting kind of weird

131
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,280
they don't know how to behave themselves

132
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:00,639
in public yet

133
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,239
i'm gonna give people a little bit of

134
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,199
time to go out and adjust and get their

135
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,799
[ __ ] back together

136
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,639

137
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,480

138
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,158

00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,319
catching up from those ridiculous dabs

185
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,240
that i took

186
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,199
uh my head is still not caught up i

187
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,319
don't know if you could tell my eyes are

188
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,240
super droopy from

189
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,599
uh this dabs and these lights are really

190
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,639
killing me today you guys so thank you

191
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
for hanging out i hope you're having as

192
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,160
much fun as i am

193
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,918
i did say that i was going to read some

194
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
patreon questions and some grow

195
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,918
questions so let's cut the chatter and

196
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,120
get right to the point of this podcast

197
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,038
i've got a bunch of great grow

198
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
questions in front of me in the last

199
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,959
episode i did say that i got a bunch of

200
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,240
short questions i wanted to catch up on

201
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,560
i've got a couple of those in this

202
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,360
episode so let's just jump right into it

203
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,319
this one says i've got a breeder

204
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,800
question

205
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,800
it says i have a feminized seed for a

206
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
strain that i really like and i want to

207
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,160
cross her

208
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
with a rise pollen okay so you've got a

209
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,520
feminized seed that you really like and

210
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,120
you want to cross it with a rise

211
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,359
that's completely acceptable taking a

212
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,918
rise male put the pollen on it that will

213
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,439
work

214
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,519
a lot of people ask about breeding with

215
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,719
feminized seeds do it that's a good

216
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,159
thing there's nothing wrong with

217
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,360
breeding with plants that came from a

218
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,520
feminized seed

219
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,639
the next part of the question says is

220
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,038
there any reason

221
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,000
or can it even be done for a breeder to

222
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,120
achieve a male

223
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
version of an original feminized

224
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,199
seed so that's a very good question um

225
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,478
where do we start here

226
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
there are a lot of things to talk about

227
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,038
in this one the question is can a

228
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
breeder

229
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,240
basically make a male female seed

230
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,318
uh they want a male selection from a

231
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,519
batch of seeds from a seed that is

232
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,960
only a feminized seedline or we will go

233
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,758
back and talk about that thing i

234
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,638
mentioned before

235
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,160
called clone only so if you've got a

236
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,519
clone only plant and i'm going to touch

237
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,960
on clone only really briefly because

238
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,439
i've already done an episode about this

239
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,239
but

240
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,079
when we say clone only what we mean is

241
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
that plant is not available in

242
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,240
seed form or at least it wasn't

243
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,039
available in seed form until we had

244
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
feminized

245
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,360
seeds dialed in and somebody made it and

246
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,960
fem seed then it was available

247
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160
so let's just pick a strain one of my

248
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,439
favorites to talk about and this will

249
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,880
put me on a good rant

250
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:25,439
is gorilla glue number four there is not

251
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,839
a male of gorilla glue number four

252
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,160
gorilla glue number four was a phenotype

253
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,318
of a batch of gorilla glue seeds

254
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,199
and it was the number four phenotype in

255
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,120
that batch

256
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,800
number four was a female it's the one

257
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,319
that got popular they got spread out

258
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,120
that everybody smokes that everybody

259
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,280
loves

260
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,319
so there is gorilla glue number four is

261
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,638
a clone

262
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,000
only the breeder of that never put out

263
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,840
any of the original seeds

264
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,199
he didn't let out other phenotypes he

265
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,399
did not let out a boy

266
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,240
so there's only a female phenotype of

267
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,560
the gorilla glue number four which is

268
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,598
number four and it is a clone

269
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,439
only so that's where we're going to

270
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,199
start with clone only all right here's

271
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,399
one way that i like to explain clone

272
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,478
only that everybody will understand

273
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,758
let's say that we discovered an animal

274
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,359
there's only one of them

275
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,120
we've found one of these animals and

276
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
it's a female so we've got

277
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,639
and we're going to name this animal just

278
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,000
for the sake of this conversation i'm

279
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
going to name this animal

280
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,038
gorilla glue number four that's the name

281
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,800
of this animal

282
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,318
it's walking around it's growling it's

283
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
grunting it's eating it's pooping

284
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,319
it's an animal it's a female it's name

285
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,800
is gorilla glue number four

286
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,319
how do we make more of them we can't

287
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,560
because we don't have a male

288
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,320
this is a a mammal it's got to have some

289
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,838
sort of and it's got to have sperm and

290
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,800
an egg it's got to have reproduction

291
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,719
happening there

292
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,799
uh so without the other part of that

293
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,599
reproduction we cannot make more so now

294
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,679
that animal

295
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
is basically clone only there's only one

296
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,958
of it we can't reproduce it

297
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,560
uh whoever created it didn't give us

298
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,599
more seeds or more of that we've only

299
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,559
got the one

300
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,399
so it's going to be the only one luckily

301
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,799
with plants we can make clones

302
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,159
so it's clone only but that one animal

303
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,079
that's the only one that there is

304
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,759
you can't reproduce that the only way it

305
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,320
can be reproduced is through

306
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,919
clone clone only is the only way that

307
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
that plant is available

308
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,120
so that's what i'm talking about when i

309
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,800
say clone only that's why i like to pick

310
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,440
gorilla glue number four

311
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,039
because it is a specific phenotype if

312
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
somebody tells you they've got seeds of

313
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,639
gorilla glue number four

314
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,240
there's something done to those seeds

315
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,080
it's either feminized or it's been

316
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
adulterated it's a bat cross it is

317
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,360
something like that so

318
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,639
that talks about clone only now the

319
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,919
question is can it be done if a breeder

320
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,838
only has feminized seeds so if i had a

321
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,120
clone only and i wanted to make seeds of

322
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,880
it

323
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,560
let's talk about golden goat now because

324
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,559
this has actually happened

325
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,679
uh people wanted golden goat seeds

326
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,159
golden goat is

327
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,559
clone only the original golden goat was

328
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,360
not released in any seed form no males

329
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,719
were put out

330
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,639
there were a couple of phenotypes that

331
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
were released of the golden go one was

332
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,519
called the golden goat the other one was

333
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,240
called the funky [ __ ] there were others

334
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
that were never

335
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
sought after and uh very impressive so

336
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,200
the golden goat

337
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,680
was the one that was spread around it's

338
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,879
a clone only until i got my hands on it

339
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,799
other people have done this too but i'm

340
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,278
saying until i got my grubby little paws

341
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,479
on it

342
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,159
and everybody was like dude i want

343
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,720
golden goat seeds i want golden goat

344
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,439
seeds

345
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,600
i reversed it and made feminized golden

346
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,920
goat seeds now the seeds were available

347
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,759
it is not clone only but now what those

348
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:21,120
are is golden goat

349
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,480
s1 seeds they are self s ones

350
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,399
my friend pete's going to say they are

351
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,920
f1s but they are

352
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,559
feminized s1 self seeds of the golden go

353
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,639
they will be very very close

354
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,879
representations of the original golden

355
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,000
goat female but there will be some

356
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,519
variation

357
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,679
you will find phenotypes that are

358
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,360
complete mirrors of that original mom

359
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,120
you will also find phenotypes

360
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,639
that are a little bit different in some

361
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,919
ways one will look more like mommy you

362
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,399
want to look a little bit more like

363
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,919
daddy

364
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,759
but you're going to find a lot that

365
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,679
looked just like the original mom

366
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,278
now it's important that we label that

367
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,359
golden goat s1

368
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,039
because it's not the original golden

369
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,919
goat it is not the clone only it is

370
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,240
misleading

371
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,838
to say that that is golden goat if

372
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,200
you're giving the clones out to somebody

373
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,640
else to grow if you're just growing it

374
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
in your garden you're growing it you're

375
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,159
smoking it you're enjoying it

376
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,680
label it whatever you want but if you're

377
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,600
gonna pass that clone on

378
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,958
make sure people know that that was a

379
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
golden goat clone

380
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,679
from your feminized seed stock not from

381
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:22,078
my original golden goat stock

382
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:24,639
or mr dank's original golden goat stock

383
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,319
all right so we've gotten to clone only

384
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,838
now we've gotten to feminize seeds now

385
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
the question is is there a way for a

386
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,320
breeder

387
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,879
to achieve a male version of the

388
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,560
original feminized seed

389
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,879
this is where we work into a back cross

390
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,000
a back cross is the closest

391
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,240
representation

392
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,159
that we can pull out from a feminized

393
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,519
seed to achieve a male

394
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,759
that will look like the plant we're

395
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,560
looking for for our breeding project

396
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,759
a bat cross is often labeled bx a bat

397
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,799
cross is also

398
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,799
uh commonly labeled bc uh which i'm

399
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,559
learning may be the correct term we're

400
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,838
adulterating and [ __ ] up terms here

401
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,359
in the cannabis industry and i'm going

402
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,560
to do another conversation about that

403
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,440
very soon but

404
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,078
uh you will see bx or bc that means bat

405
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,480
cross

406
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,120
there will also be a number after those

407
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,680
letters

408
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,039
uh if it's just bx or bc it is a back

409
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,039
cross number one

410
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,919
if you see the bx or bc and then a

411
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,078
number it's a bx2 bat cross 2

412
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,360
bat cross 3 bat cross 4 which is a

413
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,679
different generation

414
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
and working of the back cross in an

415
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,719
effort to stabilize the traits which we

416
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,319
are looking for

417
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,920
isolate the plant we're looking for and

418
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
remove the other plant traits

419
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,439
which we adulterated this plant with to

420
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,838
create the seeds now let's talk about

421
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,120
this adulteration i'm talking about

422
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,360
we want to make seeds regular seeds from

423
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,120
a plant which we have only got feminized

424
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,639
seed stock so we're starting with

425
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,639
feminized seeds

426
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,039
grow those seeds find the one that you

427
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,240
like find your phenotype that suits your

428
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,919
project the best

429
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,440
i'm gonna say we're working with golden

430
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,360
goat because i have done this and it is

431
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,680
easy to follow this example

432
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,039
so i have i have the original golden

433
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,278
goat i want to make

434
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,039
regular seeds of golden go but it's

435
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:03,600
clone only because i've only got that

436
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,439
female

437
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,680
there isn't a boy to play with i've got

438
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,320
to find something to

439
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,519
pollinate my golden goat with to make

440
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,399
more seeds

441
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,480
so here is how i approached a bat cross

442
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,879
there are several ways to do this

443
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,959
this is how i did it and why i did it

444
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,879
and i'm just gonna talk about it and

445
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,638
i am open to your criticism and i'm

446
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,519
excited to see the feedback here is what

447
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,399
i did

448
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,959
my goal my goal was to create golden

449
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,600
goat

450
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,119
bat cross seeds that closely represented

451
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,360
the original golden goat

452
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,120
when grown without being feminized

453
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,560
because many people are not fans of

454
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,120
feminized seeds

455
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,559
the way i did this i took the original

456
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,959
golden goat female

457
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,479
i took a male plant that was completely

458
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,879
different from that golden goat

459
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,320
in every way it was different

460
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,679
excuse the throat clearing you guys i

461
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,199
apologize for that i'm not going to edit

462
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,519
it out because i'm on a fat flow

463
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,719
uh did take some fat dabs i took the

464
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,959
original golden go

465
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,720
i pollinated that with a male plant that

466
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,278
was completely different from golden

467
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,399
goat in

468
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:09,519
every way it was different in aroma

469
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,078
flavor buzz but most importantly

470
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,198
structure and leaf shape when growing

471
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,759
these two plants

472
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,240
i could vastly see that this plant had

473
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,879
long

474
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,079
skinny pointy sharp serrated edge leaves

475
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,679
and it grew tall

476
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,198
and are not super tall but it stayed

477
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,239
kind of squatty but it got tall and

478
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,000
sativa-like and

479
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,919
i could really see that plant structure

480
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,198
in the golden go golden goat has a very

481
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,639
unique growth

482
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,078
and once you grow it you'll see it and

483
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,278
you'll go yeah that's noticeable from

484
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,519
across the room

485
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:38,240
the other plant that i was working with

486
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,799
was an og kush dominant plant i used a

487
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,639
daybreaker male which is joseph og

488
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,000
and kim d i may have done that backwards

489
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,959
it is a chemdi female

490
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,399
to a joseph og male uh so i took that

491
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,919
daybreaker mail

492
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,399
and i used the pollen from that

493
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,159
daybreaker the daybreaker had gigantic

494
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,240
leaves so the golden goat had

495
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,319
long skinny leaves that were real sharp

496
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,680
the daybreaker had leaves that uh you

497
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
could pull the leaves off and build a

498
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,120
canopy and [ __ ] camp out underneath

499
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,399
those things the leaves were so big they

500
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,759
worked like umbrellas

501
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,360
you could shade the whole house the

502
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,278
whole car you could build a village with

503
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,320
those leaves they were so big

504
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,759
uh the golden goat was real sturdy and

505
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,000
grew really quickly

506
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,838
that day breaker was a little spindly

507
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,519
kind of og cushy if you know anything

508
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,000
about growing an og kush plant

509
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,959
it had that serious og kush going on to

510
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,240
it so

511
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,759
i then pollinated the golden goat female

512
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
with the pollen from the original

513
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,399
daybreaker mail now we've got seeds

514
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,159
this batch of seeds is where king

515
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,000
solomon came from but that's another

516
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,719
story we'll talk about that later

517
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,440
from this batch of seeds i selected a

518
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,480
male

519
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,680
that looks exactly like the golden goat

520
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,560
and we'll talk about how i did that

521
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,198
i found a plant that had long skinny

522
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,278
leaves

523
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,278
that when i rubbed the stem it smelled

524
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,799
just like the female golden goat when i

525
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,120
rub the stem so that's telling me i've

526
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,198
got a really really good match

527
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,440
so i'm looking for leaf shape and i went

528
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,000
as far as to take the leaves off of this

529
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,000
plant

530
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,360
and hold them over the leaves on this

531
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,360
plant so i've got the leaves and i'm

532
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,199
matching them up like puzzle pieces

533
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,800
to find the plant the male plant that

534
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,479
made the leaves that looked just like

535
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,000
that original golden goat

536
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,560
now my goal my idea was to find a male

537
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,399
plant

538
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,078
that carried all of those golden goat

539
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,879
traits but did not look like the

540
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,359
daybreaker

541
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,720
that's why i chose a plant that was so

542
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,800
vastly different

543
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,000
from the golden goat i basically was

544
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,479
mixing red

545
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,360
and blue marbles in a jar and i'm just

546
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,759
trying to find

547
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,440
the blue marbles again later when i went

548
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,159
looking for my phenotype they were so

549
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,320
far apart

550
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,639
in visual appearance that it was really

551
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,000
obvious which phenotypes were golden

552
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,839
goat it was really obvious which

553
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,078
phenotypes were daybreaker

554
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,160
so i searched through those i grew out a

555
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,159
lot of male plants my main

556
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,838
goal for this project was to find king

557
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,799
solomon as who i was looking for but

558
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,360
along the way

559
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,919
i found a golden goat keeper that was

560
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,120
[ __ ]

561
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:01,039
perfect in my opinion it grew just

562
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,399
like the golden goat female if i put

563
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,318
them side by side

564
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,318
this male and this female in veg and let

565
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,159
them grow for the first like four or

566
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,599
five weeks they would mimic each other

567
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,120
they would start to change a little bit

568
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,318
closer to flower because the male and

569
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,078
the female start doing a little bit

570
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,838
different things in flower but

571
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,438
they looked like they looked like

572
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,000
[ __ ] clones they looked like twins of

573
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,640
each other

574
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,119
i was super excited so now i've got a

575
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,199
male

576
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,198
that looks just like my original golden

577
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,120
go right i've got a male that is

578
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,798
golden goat two daybreaker it's 50

579
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,359
percent golden goat 50

580
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,720
daybreaker but it looks so much like the

581
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,038
golden goat that i want to say it was

582
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,000
like

583
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,480
70 to 80 golden go i hope i said that

584
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,119
right

585
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,558
uh it was really close to golden goat so

586
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,798
close to golden goat so

587
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,599
i took that golden goat male all right i

588
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:45,839
got a boy

589
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,439
and i put that pollen on the original

590
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,319
golden goat girl

591
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,360
now we have got the fur the pollen donor

592
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,720
is like

593
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,918
70 to 80 we'll just say 75 percent it is

594
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,558
three-quarters

595
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,799
golden goat in my opinion by looks by

596
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,639
smell by growth characteristics

597
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,879
uh and then we put that on a plant that

598
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,880
is 100 golden goat

599
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,000
we've got like if you do the math on

600
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
there i'm not going to get the math

601
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,599
perfectly it's probably in the high

602
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,798
80s low 90s percentage of phenotypes

603
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,119
that should look

604
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,639
just like the original golden goat

605
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,558
because the amount of genetic

606
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,679
that you put in there is so much like

607
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,200
the golden goat i'm going to say it's

608
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,759
probably 85 percent

609
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,279
at least 75 percent of the phenotypes

610
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,079
that come out of those seeds

611
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,839
are very very close representations of

612
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,558
the original golden goat so

613
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,839
i've told you my idea i told you my goal

614
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,839
i told you my method

615
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,959
and i told you what i did and i told you

616
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,558
how it came out

617
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,360
the bx1 or the bc1 the bat cross 1

618
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,359
looks very very close to that original

619
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,279
golden goat so now what i could

620
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,719
should maybe will do in the future i've

621
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,079
got so many projects in mind you guys

622
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,798
that it's hard to keep up with my own

623
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,519
ideas

624
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,639
what i want to do in the future i want

625
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,160
to grow a batch

626
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,320
of those golden goat back cross 1 seeds

627
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,759
and now find another male in there that

628
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,359
is even closer

629
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,200
to the original golden goat i don't know

630
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,079
if i can get closer but

631
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,080
technically there are more golden goat

632
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,399
marbles in this mix then there are

633
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,639
daybreaker marbles in this mix by a long

634
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,519
shot so maybe i can even narrow it down

635
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
to get like

636
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,918
92 percent of the phenotypes to look

637
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,759
just like the original mom

638
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,200
then i would repeat that process find a

639
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,720
male out of those seeds

640
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,720
and i'm going to keep pollinating that

641
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,558
original golden goat female

642
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,558
so every time i do this if i do it

643
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,960
correctly i'm getting closer

644
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,319
and closer to recreating that original

645
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,640
golden goat by the time we get to the

646
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,678
second third maybe fourth back cross

647
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,200
they should come out very very uniform

648
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,240
compared to that original golden goat

649
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,919
you guys i need a little drink of this

650
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,599
coconut water here my throat is itchy

651
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,120
it's kind of dry from the dabs but i'm

652
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,399
not ready to stop yet so i'm going to

653
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,038
freshen up the voice we're going to keep

654
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,440
talking here um

655
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,279
can it be done or is there a reason uh

656
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,558
yes it can be done it can be done by

657
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,720
keep back crossing

658
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,399
the the genetics will be what i call

659
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,400
adulterated it's not going to be

660
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,679
pure golden goat and it is important as

661
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,280
a seed seller

662
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,519
if you're giving away clones if you're

663
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,279
selling trading sharing seeds

664
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,679
make it known that this is the golden

665
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,480
goat back cross and not the original

666
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,360
golden goat

667
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,079
that is very important in my opinion as

668
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,279
a breeder

669
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,639
as a seed maker as a podcaster as the

670
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,200
person in my position

671
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,559
in the cannabis community world industry

672
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,400
whatever you want to call it

673
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,079
uh we've got responsibilities i've got a

674
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,759
huge responsibility i've kind of

675
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,599
dedicated myself to being sort of a

676
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,599
cannabis historian

677
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,879
this is documented history this is

678
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,678
happening here

679
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,200
i think it's partly uh my responsibility

680
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,960
but also if you're giving out seed

681
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,038
sharing seeds it's your responsibility

682
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,200
to keep this cannabis history

683
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,400
very genuine and very true and very pure

684
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,840
i'm gonna take a drink because i really

685
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
need it

686
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,880
i'm gonna take another drink because

687
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,879
that one was so good

688
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,119
shout out to the coconut water they

689
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,440
don't pay me

690
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,639
but i like it they should pay me hey

691
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,679
viticoco if you want to send me some

692
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,640
coconut water

693
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,240
i would take it also david gt's i drink

694
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,960
two of those blue kombuchas every day

695
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,880
bro

696
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,400
talk to me all right you guys shameless

697
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,760
advertising here nobody's paying me for

698
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,440
this i'm just having fun today

699
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,359
uh really loving podcasting anyway

700
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,600
um the reason for doing this would be to

701
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,759
achieve a non-feminized version of the

702
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,918
golden goat seeds a lot of people have

703
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,158
uh deep founded hatred for feminized

704
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,559
seeds a lot of that in my opinion

705
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,159
is miseducation a lot of that in my

706
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,839
opinion is people were

707
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,520
making poor feminized seeds uh years ago

708
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,359
years ago they tried to make feminized

709
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,839
seeds that just weren't working

710
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,399
so that did give fems a bad reputation

711
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,399
now

712
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,159
i feel like i understand how to make

713
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,559
feminized seeds i understand

714
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,320
the selecting of the plants i understand

715
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,200
the process of creating feminized pollen

716
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,279
i understand

717
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,038
the project of putting the two together

718
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,879
i know how to do that so now i think

719
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,038
feminized seeds are much

720
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,480
more reliable they're better made the

721
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,720
breeders are more responsible they're

722
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,319
more ethically sourced and better done

723
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,319
so a lot of people have a lot of hatred

724
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,918
for femme seeds that is why we are

725
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,439
making bat cross seeds

726
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,840
but we've got to adulterate that

727
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,440
original cross so

728
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,759
the toss up there is do you want

729
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,519
feminized seeds or slightly adulterated

730
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,319
crosses to achieve the project you're

731
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,079
looking for

732
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,918
is there any reason yes because people

733
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,359
don't want fem seeds can it be done yes

734
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,840
through bat crossing

735
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,599
um but then it is adulterated so i think

736
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,879
i answered that question i really went

737
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,558
on about that one

738
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,400
that got me on a good rant which i've

739
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,079
needed i think the audience enjoys when

740
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,720
i get going like that so thank you for

741
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,319
that one

742
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,919
you did not say if you wanted your name

743
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,519
set on the show or not so i'm not gonna

744
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,400
say it because it's easier that way for

745
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,000
both of us

746
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,240
either way big shout out thank you for

747
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,119
the great content big fist bump you know

748
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
who you are

749
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,199
let's move into the next one because i'm

750
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,360
awful freaking rambly

751
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,720
is it mathematically possible that's one

752
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,678
of the updates that they sent for this

753
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,200
question

754
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,519
um yes it is mathematically possible

755
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
uh to create that mail but you're gonna

756
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,240
have to do some back crossing they wrap

757
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,720
that message up with i

758
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,599
am high then they kind of ask in a

759
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,679
roundabout way

760
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,199
if it's possible to get a male from a

761
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,919
feminized seed

762
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,960
um yes sometimes a male will pop up in a

763
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,280
feminized seed

764
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,159
it is very uncommon it's probably one in

765
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,319
a million

766
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,360
to get a male from a feminized seed i've

767
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,678
seen a line

768
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,639
uh that i've worked with for a little

769
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,960
while now

770
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,679
that uh it's a feminized project and

771
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,798
about

772
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,240
one in every five thousand seeds or so

773
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:35,359
it's hard to guess i know how many seeds

774
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,038
were produced i know

775
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,798
how many were put out i don't know how

776
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,000
many were grown so all the reports can't

777
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:40,558
be completely accurate because i don't

778
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,839
know

779
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,440
people buy seeds and put them in a

780
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,959
drawer and stash them and hoard them and

781
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
keep them like pokemon cards and don't

782
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,000
grow them but

783
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,599
i've seen two males pop up from one

784
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,200
strain that is feminized

785
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,639
solid males not sure how it's happened

786
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,600
but two people have sent me a picture of

787
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,159
a male and they're like hey these are

788
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,639
femmes

789
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,679
how do i have a male uh that is genetics

790
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
as a breeder

791
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,120
uh as a seed maker i understand that i'm

792
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,278
toying with science and nature and

793
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,038
i make great selections i do my research

794
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,599
i do my due diligence but

795
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,200
it is nature uh you can train your dog

796
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,719
to do all the tricks and all the [ __ ]

797
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,400
magic you want that dog to do but one

798
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,600
day that dog may [ __ ] right on the rug

799
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,120
and occasionally

800
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,879
that stuff happens in life we're working

801
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,158
with seeds in nature and there are

802
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,039
anomalies here but

803
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,559
uh that uh male plant popping up in

804
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,359
femme seeds is probably

805
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,240
about one in a million to be quite

806
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,439
honest with you

807
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,200
and that's gonna happen that's just

808
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,880
genetics that's the way that the cookie

809
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,919
crumbles that's the way the genetic dice

810
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,679
roll goes

811
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,679
uh like i said you can have things

812
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,120
perfect 9999 times or 999 times however

813
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,720
many but it's always that opportunity

814
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,399
for one time for things to go weird

815
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,000
no matter how good your genetics are no

816
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,080
matter how good your breeding project

817
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,599
is something can go wrong maybe

818
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,278
somebody's got a grow room with one

819
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,480
magic [ __ ] thing happening in there

820
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,319
that you've never thought of

821
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,519
and that weird environmental trigger

822
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,960
will just bring out something you've

823
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,918
never seen as a breeder

824
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,038
anyway um yes you can get a male it is

825
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,278
very uncommon

826
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,720
one in a million to get that male out of

827
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,079
a feminized seed

828
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,839
i'm not sure if i would breed with that

829
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,000
throw that away ah

830
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,839
as a breeder i would have to just use

831
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,440
that pollen just put it on a couple of

832
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,079
plants and then see what came out of it

833
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,480

i'm a curious breeder the uh i'm

835
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,759
passionately curious the curiosity in me

read more questions because i'm getting

839
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:25,919
rambly

840
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,759
uh this one says if seeds here now will

841
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,200
not let me combine my discounts on irie

842
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,119
genetics purchases

843
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,600
what breeders on seeds here now would

844
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,678
you recommend i spend my saved points on

845
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,879
that is a really good question you guys

846
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,519
um so our friend here is shopping on

847
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,480
seeds herenow.com use coupon code gfyh10

848

849
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
on your order but when you're shopping

850
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,600
at seedshearnow.com you do acquire

851
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,880
points you accrue points is the word i

852
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,278
think i'm trying to use

future you can use those points to make

856
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,400
purchases

857
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,879
points toward purchases but they're not

858
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,559

you cannot also double dip and use your

862
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,880
points so my friend is asking

863
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,839
are there any other breeders that you

864
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,240
would recommend i can spend my points on

865
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,599
that is a very uh good question it's a

866
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,519
kind of puts me on the spot it's kind of

867
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,759
a weird question being friends

868
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,599
with so many breeders so many seed

869
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,278
makers sellers i'm friends with all of

870
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,798
the industry i go to all of the events i

871
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:25,919
look at all the people shake their hands

872
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,319
see their faces

873
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,480
high five fist bumps hugs all around so

874
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,240
picking a couple of people to recommend

875
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,759
that you buy their stuff is really kind

876
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,679
of putting me on the spot

877
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,440
but i chose a couple people that i would

878
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,559
recommend for you because

879
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,798
their crosses have my attention the

880
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,399
plants they're working with uh the

881
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,839
starting plants they're growing breeding

882
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,159
with the plants they've been working

883
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,519
with

884
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,520
back crossing f2ing their stock is great

885
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,759
the outcome from their stock has always

886
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,038
been great i like the terp profiles i

887
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,119
like the potency

888
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,879
i like the people so let's talk a little

889
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,639
bit about um

890
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,000
breeders that i would recommend right

891
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,200
now there's a breeder that kind of snuck

892
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,359
up out of nowhere

893
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,200
uh came out of nowhere recently probably

894
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,879
the last couple of years

895
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,480
i see a lot of breeders i see a lot of

896
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,120
things i really think that

897
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,798
uh seattle chronic needs more attention

898
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,558
if you had some points to spend i would

899
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,158
give seattle chronic a chance

900
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,918
on some seeds they've got a lot of great

901
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,360
stuff i've talked to them on a couple of

902
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,080
podcasts seen the way that they do

903
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,319
things

904
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,519
lots of selection lots of rigorous

905
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,439
testing

906
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,038
lots of ideas going into their projects

907
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,278
lots of thought

908
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,038
so check out seattle chronic seeds i

909
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,240
would recommend them good people

910
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:38,960

guy i like the way that

932

uh if he wants to compliment you you'll

933
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,840
get a compliment also if he needs to

934
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,158
tell you to go [ __ ] yourself

935
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,879
he will flat out tell you hey go [ __ ]

936
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,799
yourself

937
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,799
but i want to give a shout out to jj

938
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,798
from top dog i would recommend top dog

939
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,918
seeds those are good seeds

940
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,879
i am breeding with the uh chem daily kim

941
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,520
the chem d2 i-95 is a [ __ ] great

942
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,159
plant

943
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,918
it is stanky it grows super vigorous it

944
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,480
makes trichomes and veg

945
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,600
uh that is a good [ __ ] plant so also

946
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,599
the exotic mic

947
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,079
i bred with the cookies and cream number

948
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,439
13. that plant was [ __ ] amazing that

949
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,519
is what made the cream

950
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,640
so i'm working with these guys projects

951
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:54,480
i haven't worked with

952
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,240
i haven't bred with seattle chronic

953
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,278
seeds yet but that may happen in the

954
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,599
future they do

955
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,960
uh cbd leaning stuff and a whole bunch

956
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,678
of different stuff their breeding is a

957
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,919
little bit uh

958
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,278
not what i'm doing which is totally fine

959
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,240
but i do recommend them good

960
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,038
[ __ ] then i would be uh doing everybody

961
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,720
a disservice

962
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,079
if i didn't say to get yourself some

963
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,240
seeds from miss

964
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:16,079
jill miss jill is putting out some great

965
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,798
crosses lately she is available on seeds

966
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,119
here now

967
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,240
i would definitely say get some stuff

968
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,199
from miss

969
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,558
jill then i've got to recommend another

970
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,319
colorado boy

971
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,839
people are going gonna send me thumbs up

972
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,599
and thumbs downs for this recommendation

973
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,079
but that's how the world works

974
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,079
um there's a reason why when you go to

975
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,759
the indo expo the cannabis cups any

976
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,439
cannabis related event there's a reason

977
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,200
why some people have gigantic [ __ ]

978
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,759
boots and lines out the door

979
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,200
and you can't deny success and quality

980
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,119
when you see it

981
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,798
and i'm gonna say that uh if you need

982
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,000
some seeds from seeds here now and

983
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,079
you've got some coupons

984
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,079
check out the ethos seeds what do they

985
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,119
call themselves on there ethos genetics

986
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,278
i used to know them as the ethos

987
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,918
collective i just know them as their

988
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,319
names

989
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,080
but uh check out ethos seeds a lot of

990
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,678
people are gonna have feedback on that

991
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:02,960
again i'm talking about the seeds i'm

992
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,480
not talking about the people i'm not

993
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,840
talking about any of that stuff

994
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,399
when you go to the events you will

995
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,798
notice that ethos has a line out

who are there ah james loud is out there

1069
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,119
the people that you could see their

1070
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,960
faces adam dunn's got his own podcast

1071
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,719
i respect that if you put your face out

1072
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,319
there that just shows you're not hiding

1073
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,880
behind the internet hiding behind your

1074
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,000
logo

1075
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
there are a lot of breeders that we

1076
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,079
don't know what they look like we don't

1077
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
know who they are

1078
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,759
some of them we haven't even heard their

1079
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,558
real voices like i like it when it's

1080
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,879
transparent

1081
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,960
that does a lot for me business-wise uh

1082
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,640
it's not it's not illegal anymore it's

1083
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,880
not the [ __ ] black market it's not

1084
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,480
the dark ages it's not the dark web

1085
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,080
i'm right here i'm ross to jeff i read

1086
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,278
genetics premium seeds

1087
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,599
that should mean a lot to people it

1088
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,079
means a lot to me as well i'm [ __ ]

1089
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,079
high

1090
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,319
and rambly and we're not even going to

1091
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,759
edit this so let's keep on going i've

1092
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,439
got another great question

1093
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,200
i want to do one more before we wrap

1094
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,600
this up this one comes from

1095
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,840
sticky randy's garden and it goes a lot

1096
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,519
like this it says i'm selecting oh okay

1097
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,798
it says i'm selecting

1098
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,640
that's not even what it says it just

1099
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,759
says selecting the right plants for a

1100
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,000
perpetual grow

1101
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,000
so this person is asking about selecting

1102
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,278
the right plants for a perpetual grow it

1103
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,079
says right now i'm dealing with the

1104
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,240
sassy

1105
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,480
o.g kushfino who is super sensitive to

1106
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,079
light and forcing me to raise my lights

1107
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,919
to keep her from drying out while my

1108
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,599
other phenos are doing fine under the

1109
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,440
same intensity

1110
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,599
oh that is frustrating i know that

1111
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,038
struggle it says in her defense

1112
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,199
i could have seen this coming as she

1113
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:33,839
grew thinner leaves and a less filled

1114
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,038
canopy

1115
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,558
than my other phenos of the same strain

1116
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,240
um so there are a couple things to talk

1117
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,000
about right there they want advice on

1118
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,319
selecting the correct plants for a

1119
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,398
perpetual grow because obviously this

1120
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,918
sassy og kush phenotype is being a

1121
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:49,359
little [ __ ] in there

1122
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,519
i think you've already learned your

1123
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,278
lesson but the challenge is

1124
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,120
uh have you run have you ran these

1125
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,759
phenotypes before are you doing a phenol

1126
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,359
hunt

1127
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:58,879
and that first final hunt i just want

1128
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,240
them small to see what i've got

1129
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,000
then you know what you're working with

1130
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,599
then select plants that run

1131
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,320
similarly for your perpetual grow

1132
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,878
uh plants that definitely grow the same

1133
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,280
height

1134
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,398
uh plants that grow uh kind of the same

1135
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,159
structures that way

1136
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,440
you can plant that if you've got i'm

1137
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,119
just gonna hypothetically

1138
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,639
guess that you've got a five by five and

1139
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,159
you're doing one plant here

1140
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,079
in each corner one here one here one

1141
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,599
here you got four plants uh

1142
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,839
try to have plants that grow about the

1143
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,399
same height they grow the same bushiness

1144
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,239
that way

1145
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,679
all of your plants are the same diameter

1146
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,959
taking up the same amount of space in

1147
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,878
your grow

1148
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,639
try to get plants that like the same

1149
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,440
type of vpd

1150
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,320
in a in an ideal world we would lower

1151
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
temperatures

1152
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,838
later in flower but you can't do that

1153
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,599
because you've got other plants in there

1154
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,440
so you need to find plants that are

1155
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,119
happy with the same vpd

1156
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,119
throughout their entire growth cycle

1157
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,838
that way we can have plants at week one

1158
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,519
a flower

1159
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,199
plants a week three of flower i'm not

1160
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,079
sure your staggered cycles but you get

1161
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,239
what i'm saying

1162
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,640
we need plants happy a week one week

1163
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,919
three week five week seven and week nine

1164
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,838
because you got plants of all different

1165
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,680
stages in there we need to find the

1166
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,960
appropriate plants that match up well

1167
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,559
together

1168
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,800
i hate to say this because it sounds

1169
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,880
like you want to run multiple phenotypes

1170
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,400
and multiple plants in there but

1171
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,240
if you want to run this perpetual and

1172
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,280
maximize it to its full potential you

1173
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,239
may want to

1174
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,960
crop which means stick to one strain in

1175
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,319
that room

1176
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,199
or find two strains that work very well

1177
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,920
together

1178
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,679
and maybe you've got a longer one and a

1179
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,079
shorter one so you can do one for like

1180
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,759
60 days and one for 70. that way you got

1181
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,119
a crop that's ready and then you got a

1182
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,400
crop you kind of gotta wait on and then

1183
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,160
the next one it's ready and then you

1184
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,000
gotta kind of gotta wait on the next one

1185
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,838
get your rhythm figured out but you're

1186
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,519
gonna want plants probably that finish

1187
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,000
around the same amount of time

1188
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,000
plants they want the same amount of vpd

1189
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,119
through the entire growth cycle

1190
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,480
uh plants that want the same vpd as each

1191
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,000
other so that you can get it right for

1192
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,880
this plant and this plant it's really

1193
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,880
hard

1194
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,920
trying to dial in the room for like

1195
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,000
dosey dough

1196
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,680
and platinum tangy at the same time it's

1197
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,960
two different environments so

1198
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,480
you're going to want plants it's all

1199
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,199
about finding the plants that work well

1200
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,119
together

1201
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,639
you might want to do chill out on the

1202
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,559
perpetual and do

1203
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,480
a pheno hunt and then find a couple of

1204
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,639
phenotypes that work well together

1205
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,000
and then start the perpetual over once

1206
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,879
you've got those phenos

1207
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,639
selected and dialed in um find plants

1208
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,240
that grow with similar height

1209
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,679
shape structure um just similar plants

1210
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,159
you got to have plants that work well

1211
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,440
together in there

1212
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,719
unfortunately i don't know what you have

1213
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,519
access to it sounds like you're growing

1214
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,358
from seed

1215
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,440
because it said uh you could have seen

1216
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,000
this coming uh because other phenos in

1217
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,838
the room so

1218
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,358
you must be grown from seed so find a

1219
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:38,838
couple of phenotypes that work best for

1220
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,000
you that is the best part about doing

1221
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:42,078
selections

1222
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,280
you can find things that are vastly

1223
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,839
different in buzz

1224
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,119
and flavor and aroma but still that grow

1225
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,759
very similarly

1226
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,160
uh prana prana is gonna stay kind of

1227
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,560
short

1228
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,639
and squat and it's gonna have that that

1229
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,400
hippie incense sort of a flavor to it

1230
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:57,920
if you put morning dew next to it it

1231
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,519
would grow very well next to it they

1232
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,320
would work very well in a perpetual

1233
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,800
together

1234
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,160
uh similar feed similar vpd but the buzz

1235
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,760
and flavor and aroma

1236
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,759
are going to be way different so

1237
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,440
something like that may work for you

1238
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,359
blue raspberry truffle and strawberry

1239
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,119
starburst they grow similarly

1240
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,639
but their buzz and their flavor are so

1241
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,119
different that that would work well for

1242
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,799
you

1243
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,880
so those would also work well if you

1244
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,079
want to run one big room together

1245
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,000
do the blue raspberry truffle and

1246
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,760
strawberry starburst together but

1247
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,119
if you want to do that perpetual uh

1248
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
you're gonna have to find strains that

1249
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,640
all work

1250
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,679
on the schedule on the cycle don't go

1251
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,838
into this

1252
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,039
starting perpetually keep in mind that

1253
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:35,838
there are steps

1254
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,920
um you've got to find your phenotypes

1255
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,639
you've got to dial in your phenotypes

1256
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,280
you've got to learn every detail of that

1257
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,039
girl

1258
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,800
uh this is like having multiple

1259
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:45,838
girlfriends in one room which is going

1260
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,359
to be a challenge

1261
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:48,639
because one girl probably wants to

1262
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,000
listen to this kind of music and the

1263
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,358
other girl wants to listen to this kind

1264
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,559
of music so you got to find the music

1265
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:53,199
right in the middle for both of those

1266
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,279
girls

1267
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,118
or you got to find two girls that both

1268
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,920
want to listen to fish and reggae all

1269
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,160
day long

1270
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,599
and they got to be careful and okay with

1271
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,118
being in the same room together

1272
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,880
so that's where your challenge is you

1273
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,838
got to find the plants that are perfect

1274
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,440
for your room

1275
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:08,799
so don't think that the first don't

1276
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,240
think you're going to pop seeds and

1277
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,200
start a perpetual grow

1278
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,239
pop seeds find phenotypes select two

1279
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,639
phenotypes

1280
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,279
dial in those phenotypes then with the

1281
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:19,759
dialed in

1282
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,960
information start the perpetual there i

1283
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,960
feel like we jump in

1284
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,240
uh with big plans big ideas a little bit

1285
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,159
too early sometimes

1286
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,759
when it comes to cannabis growing so

1287
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,920
have a goal have a strategy

1288
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,680
select your phenotypes that way then set

1289
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,760
up the perpetual grow

1290
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,679
go in steps don't try to knock out too

1291
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,680
many goals all at one time

1292
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,440
that i think will really help you out

1293
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,879
all right my buddy sticky randy's garden

1294
