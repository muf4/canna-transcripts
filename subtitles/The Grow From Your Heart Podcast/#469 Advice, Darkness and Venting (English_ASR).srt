11
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,410
aroma it's got a delicious flavor then

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,989
the appearance of this concentrate is

13
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,808
perfect I've got a big 4 gram jar it

14
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:06,599
looks like a nice jar of iced tea or

15
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:08,670
Terp tea if you will I've got some nice

16
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,859
icebergs floating around in here some

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,560
nice diamonds a perfect ratio of

18
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:15,629
diamonds to Terp sauce I really enjoy

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,790
the appearance again the aroma and

20
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,158
flavor are tremendous and if you can't

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,890
tell the high from this concentrate is

22
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,600
[ __ ] excellent it went straight to my

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,099
head it lifted me up it made me

24
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,259
energetic it made me want to come to a

25
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,298
podcast it made me just want to talk my

26
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,828
face off let's flip the jar over here

27
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,270
and check out the potency label on the

28
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:37,559
back of the jar it says that this

29
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:39,810
product contains 66 point 3 1% THC it

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,000
does not contain any CBD and I do

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,100
imagine that if we had a Terp test on

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,049
this product the terpene numbers would

33
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,000
be ridiculous because as soon as you

34
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,820
open this jar you can smell it from

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,649
across the room so big shout out to my

36
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,589

clubs in the country if not on the

92
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,929
entire planet I am a giant comedy nerd I

93

I love comedians I love going to comedy

95
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,019
shows and laughing my ass off I go to

96
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,839
comedy works quite frequently so I am

97
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,879
treated like royalty at comedy works so

98
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,739
we headed to Comedy Works to see one of

99
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,729
my favorite comedians I listened to a

100
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,950
podcast called

101
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:10,018
the fighter and the kid I also listened

102
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,389
to another podcast called the King and

103
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,640
the sting there is a guy who was on both

104
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:17,459
of those podcasts his name is Brendan

105
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,069
Schaub he is a pretty funny comedian he

106
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,769
is a retired UFC fighter he is a fashion

107
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:25,740
model he is an all-around funny dude I

108
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,449
think he is hilarious so as soon as I

109
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,129
heard that Brendan Schaub is coming to

110
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,170
his hometown of Denver Colorado to

111
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:32,850
perform at one of the best comedy clubs

112
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,319
on the planet I knew I had to grab a

113
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,330
couple of tickets to go show some

114
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,219

115
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:39,810
King and the sting loved to go see one

116
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,060
of my favorite comedians Brendan Schaub

117
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,120
in his hometown and I'm glad I decided

118
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,620
to go because it was a great show when

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,660
we got in they treated us like royalty

120
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,389
from the very beginning we got VIP

121
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,520
wristbands we got parking passes we got

122
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,839
beautiful seats usually I'm right in the

123
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,069
front at Comedy Works we got there a

124
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,719
little bit later they didn't put me

125
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:59,670
right in the front it had a little VIP

126
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,220
meet-and-greet thing going on so some

127
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,870
people paid extra for fancy tickets so

128
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,330
they put me about three rows back and I

129
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,949
really enjoyed that third row spot my

130
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:09,990
neck wasn't as cranked as it usually is

131
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,759
trying to look at the front row I was

132
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,620
kind of nice to be right in the third

133
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,029
row so that was [ __ ] awesome really

134
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,129
great seats they brought us a couple of

135
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:18,589
snacks got us some non-alcoholic drinks

136
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:21,360
coz Clint and I do not consume alcohol

137
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:24,000
so we got settled in the show began and

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,250
the host and emcee of the evening was a

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,160
great comedian whose name was Assange

140
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,100

141

so he came out he hosted the show he

146
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,469

148

149
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,899

154
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,290
brings out another comedian and I got

155
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,300
really excited because he said you know

156
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,580
him as the voice of the King and the

157
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,259
sting and I knew it wasn't Theo because

158
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,609
he's the other member of the King and

159
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,980
the sting and I knew he was in another

160
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,900
city doing a show so I got excited I

161

166
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,280
Brendan Schaub I was really excited to

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,870
put a face on Derek posting because I

168
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,719
hear him weekly it was good to finally

169
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,500
see the dude and honestly his comedy

170
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:36,510
blew the [ __ ] room apart that dude

171
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:39,360
was hilarious I was not prepared to be

172
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,279
blown away by Derek Poston the way I was

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,990
he did maybe 50

174
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,329
or twenty minutes but it felt like 30

175
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,970
minutes of laughter it is hard for a

176
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:49,918
comedian to take the entire room with a

177
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,960
very short amount of time it takes a few

178
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,069
minutes to suck people in he walked out

179
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,449
on stage and he's like what's up

180
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,668
[ __ ] I'm funny you're gonna

181
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,269
laugh and then I got a go and that's how

182
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:59,189
it went

183
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:01,019
we [ __ ] laughed I almost pissed my

184
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,719
pants and then he's like now are you

185
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:06,060
ready for Brennan shop then shop came

186
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,010
out and he did a lot of material I did

187
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,720
not know that shop had that much

188
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:11,879
material he just put out a special on

189
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,860
show time recently and most of the time

190
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,230
once a comedian puts out a special they

191
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,910
don't do that material anymore it's like

192
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,290
you've heard those jokes we don't want

193
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,060
to [ __ ] tell those jokes anymore

194
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,890
it's called burning the material you put

195
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,329
it out and you move on you write a whole

196
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,399
new hour then you go through that

197
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:27,959
material in clubs for a year maybe do

198
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,219
that material and theatres for a year

199
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,529
then you go back and record another

200
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,390
special at that point that material is

201
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:35,519
burnt you don't get to do it anymore

202
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,289
yes there are some bits that people will

203
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,060
do over and over again like the machine

204
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,490
story with Bert Kreischer and then

205
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,978
anything Andrew Dice Clay but those are

206
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,629
comedic anomalies those don't [ __ ]

207
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:47,039
count most of the time people don't want

208
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,540
to hear your [ __ ] twice once you know

209
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,879
the punchline the joke isn't funny

210
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,860
anymore so I was blown away and

211
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,709
impressed with the amount of material

212
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,350
that shop brought to the stage one thing

213
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:02,009
I really enjoy is when I hear somebody

214
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:04,530
from a podcast on a stage telling a

215
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:06,990
story or doing a bit about stuff that

216
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:09,329
developed on the podcast recently I

217
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,970
really like watching that comedic mind

218
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:13,740
and watching that comedic snowball

219
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,840
happened like two guys are on a podcast

220
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,310
talking and something funny about I

221
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,019
don't know a white guy with dreadlocks

222
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,819
and a vape pen comes up just in the

223
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,379
funny conversation and then you'd hear

224
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,610
him tell a joke about it for two minutes

225
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,990
and then you hear it kind of taper off

226
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,819
and then you heard it on the next

227
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,019
episode they kind of make another stupid

228
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,759
joke about it that's called a callback

229
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:31,228
when you bring that up and you talk

230
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,149
about it again and then it fades and

231
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:35,189
then you go see him in a podcast or on a

232
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:36,838
comedy show two weeks later and he's got

233
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,550
30 minutes about it and you almost piss

234
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,469
your pants cuz you saw it develop and

235
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,240
you know that that's organic that joke

236
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,560
came from just a normal conversation

237
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,409
between two dudes and it is now a

238
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,379
polished and honed bit been made I think

239
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:52,199
comedy works holds about 250 maybe 320

240
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:54,149
people so it made 300 people piss their

241
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,170
pants with laughter from a little joke

242
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,909
they developed on the

243
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:59,939
cat so I think that that is great to see

244
00:08:56,909 --> 00:09:02,100
also I like seeing the influences and

245
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,990
comedians I said earlier I'm a huge

246
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,370
comedy nerd you guys this is just gonna

247
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,539
be a quick rant about comedy will move

248
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,909
on to cannabis I know I've gone way too

249
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,679
long about this but I like seeing the

250
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:12,088
roots I like looking at a comedian and

251
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,979
saying oh you sound like this guy on

252
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,290
this guy and this guy so it's really fun

253
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,430
watching the influences in shop there

254
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,099
were a couple of moments when I said

255
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:22,349
that was completely Bryan Callen that

256
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,730
was completely Joe Rogan that was

257
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,589
completely Chris D'Elia

258
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,810
but that's okay because it's you're just

259
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,579
absorbing your influences so that was

260
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:32,039
fun to see it was fun to see shop shop

261
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:33,539
crushed it he did a really good job big

262

266
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:43,948
meet everybody after the show like I

267
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,409
said there was a little meet-and-greet I

268
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:48,809
got to have a very brief conversation

269
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:50,278
with Brendan Schaub he said hey I love

270
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:51,869
the dreads and I looked him straight in

271
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,789
the face and said no you don't bro and

272
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,289
he gave me a bewildered look and I said

273
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:56,578
I listened to your podcast I know how

274
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:58,799
you feel about stupid white guys with

275
00:09:56,578 --> 00:10:01,049
dreadlocks and he made a face like oh

276
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,399
[ __ ] I've offended people and then there

277
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:03,870
was a guy taking pictures and he just

278
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,669
goes picture so we both looked at the

279
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,078
camera and we do our pose the photo

280
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:08,819
happens and I looked back at him I go

281
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:10,169
bro I'm just joking I love that you make

282
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,510
fun of white people with dreadlocks on

283
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,519
the podcast you're a comedian don't ever

284
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,708
stop doing comedy and he laughed amigos

285
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,850
okay man he like felt better like I set

286
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,958
him up to like I was like man I know

287
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,550
what you said about white people and

288
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,778
then why people dreadlocks and then I

289
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,490
let him feel relief like man I think

290
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:24,539
it's funny that you say that I can't be

291
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,430
offended because I'm a white guy with

292
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:27,539
dreadlocks I expect jokes about white

293
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:29,489
people with dreadlocks that's how it

294
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,049
goes being this guy so when I when I

295
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,759
said that he felt relief I could see it

296
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:34,289
in his face and then I just shook his

297
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,789
hand I told thank you and I was walking

298
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:37,198
away and I got a few feet away and goes

299
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:38,399
hey bro and I was like what's up man I

300
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:40,919

303
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,899
really fun and entertaining then I

304
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,549
walked outside and got to spend a minute

305
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,009

00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,240
funny just to hear everybody laugh and

328
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,830
then his mom laughs a couple of extra

329
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,389
times and then he would do the thing

330
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,800
where you kind of put your hand it's not

331
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:38,519

360
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,250
you got to kind of shut up for a little

361
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:33,870
bit but you can share that laughter and

362
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,039
then on the car ride on the way home you

363

have a lot of things to talk about

364
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,679
because the comedian's are gonna bring

365
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:39,479
up points and you get to look at each

366
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,919
other like do I agree or do I disagree

367
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,080
with this person and you can talk about

368
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,000
that in the car so go get some laughter

369
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,129
go have a show then it will create

370
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,779
conversation with your date with your

371
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:50,730

377
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,460
he's much easier than taking a [ __ ]

378
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,110
date so after the Brendan Schaub show we

379
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,900
were not done we got to meet everybody

380
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,389
then we walked about 15 minutes to the

381
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:12,389
Belko theater where we got to see what

382
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,809
another comedy show I know it's kind of

383
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:14,789
crazy

384
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:16,529
I was a little spent my laughter muscles

385
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:17,819
were done my cheeks hurt my tummy was a

386
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,039
little bit sore from laughing so hard

387
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,080
but it was

388
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,699
to get more comedy going so we went to

389
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,740
the Belko theater I've talked about the

390
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,540
Belko theater before on this show big

391
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,549
beautiful theater inside of the Denver

392
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,679
Convention Center a nice comfortable

393
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:33,389
place we got a bottle of water we got

394
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,279
our seats chilled out for a couple of

395
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:37,110
minutes they made the announcement that

396
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,759
no phones if you get your phone out you

397
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,490
were to leaving basically is what they

398
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,620
said then the lights went out and this

399
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,180
young man by the name of Jeff Tate came

400
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,620
out and did a few minutes Jeff Tate is a

401
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,719
very good comedian I'm sure you've heard

402
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,879
me speak of him before I'm not the Jeff

403
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,190
Tate from Queens right a different Jeff

404
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,439
Tate the funny Jeff Tate the funny Oh

405
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,750
Jeff Tate at least he came out he did a

406
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,110
few minutes I told a couple of jokes he

407
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,700
was mostly funny then after that the man

408
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,159
the myth the legend the [ __ ]

409
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,190
offensive one mr. Tom Segura came out

410
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,899
and blew the roof off of the Belko

411
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,310
theater it's hard to say he blew the

412
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,439
roof off of the place because he's

413
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,239
mellow he doesn't get real fired up like

414
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,760
when you see Rogan Rogan yells at you

415
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,610
when you see Joey Diaz Diaz yells at you

416
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,529
Tom Segura has more of a mellow slower

417
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,629
delivery with kind of a condescending

418
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,279
tone to it it just hits in a different

419
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:28,740
way it's darker so instead of being

420
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,449
yelled some crazy [ __ ] that makes you

421
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,019
laugh after the idea is pounded into

422
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,120
your head

423
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,620
he'll say something and then just he

424
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,629
could say a normal sentence and then

425
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,039
think of a normal sense it would be fine

426
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:40,470
I don't have an example and then just

427
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,779
add two words to it with my dick and

428
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,190
then that makes every sentence creepy

429
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,110
anything you say if you add the words

430
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,850
with my dick to the end of it it's

431
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,620
[ __ ] subtle and it's gross and

432
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,330
everybody gets that it's a joke he'll

433
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,490
just say something and that's not a Tom

434
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,350
Segura joke I'm killing his ideas of

435
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,450
jokes but he'll tell you a story and

436
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,190
then end it with my dick and that's when

437
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,390
everybody gets a huge laugh and his

438
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,130
stories are [ __ ] great

439
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:04,439
he is offensive if you want to be

440
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:06,899
offended please check out some Tom

441
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,910
Segura comedy he will piss you off in

442
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,340
the best way that's my favorite kind

443
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:12,899
kind of comedy so check that out so that

444
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,379
was a great night I got to see Brennan

445
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,079

446
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:18,240
Derek Poston Assange Ahmad I got to see

447
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,420
Jeff Tate and I got to see Tom Segura I

448
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,950
was honestly blown away by Derek post

449
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:25,169
and I can't give him enough credit and

450
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,180
enough props pay attention for Derek

451
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:29,490
Poston he is gonna blow you away in the

452
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,779
near future of course Tom Segura was the

453
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,610
highlight of the evening that was

454
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,720
[ __ ] awesome then we headed back to

466
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,560
let's go to more comedy shows

467
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:56,850
Joey Coco Diaz is coming up if you're at

468
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:58,258

469
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,750

470
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,180
high five all right so that is wrapping

471
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,188
up the comedy adventure what else did I

472
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,328
do just because it's on my mind and I

473
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:08,250
went there and it was [ __ ] awesome

474
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:10,769
let's talk about this quick road trip I

475
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,470
took just a couple of days ago I drove

476
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,789
to Evergreen Colorado the only place I

477
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,769
really mentioned that is because holy

478
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:18,899
[ __ ] it was beautiful and I cannot stop

479
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,389
thinking of the way the place felt and

480
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,669
smelled and just the vibe and the energy

481
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:26,459
there it was really calming it was

482
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:27,838
really peaceful and it was so beautiful

483
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,729
it was just the right temperature it was

484
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,589
the first kind of cool day in Colorado

485
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,480
so I didn't have my hoodie on but I kind

486
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,939
of wish I did but I enjoyed that brisk

487
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,399

511
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:25,379
episode goes just like this it says hey

512

Rasta Jeff I hope everything is going i

513
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,000
read for you on this lovely tuesday i'm

514
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,649
reading this on a Friday you are

515
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,099
probably listening on a Monday

516
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,200
everything still I read the message goes

517
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,519
on to say my name is oh let's skip that

518
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,669
I don't know if you want your name said

519
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,929
it says my name is blank and I am 22 and

520
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:45,570
I've been growing for about four years

521
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,410
total and I started at my parents house

522
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:49,689
I rolling outside

523
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,490
the time I got to having ten three-foot

524
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,320
tall plants in one area was when I

525
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,930
realized that I have a passion for

526
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:59,319
growing cannabis and I want to go about

527
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,970
this legally that is a very common story

528
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,250
a lot of people start growing they

529
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,350
realize that it is very fulfilling in

530
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,640
many ways first off you have your own

531
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:08,769
cannabis that you grew that is

532
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,360
absolutely instantly gratifying and

533
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:11,859
rewarding but there is something that

534
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,509
comes with growing your own cannabis

535
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:15,699
that is just fulfilling and a lot of

536
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:18,009
people have a passion for producing

537
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,720
their own product so our friend here

538
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:21,609
quickly realized that they have a

539
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,529
passion for growing cannabis and they

540
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:25,659
wanted to go about it legally so they

541
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:28,059
the message continues it says I attended

542
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,519
a hands-on certified cannabis college

543
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:32,409
and shortly after I applied for a grow

544
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,670
position at and I'm not gonna say the

545
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,070
name of the company but they applied for

546
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,200
a position and got hired on the spot

547
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:40,000
that is awesome you went to a certified

548
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,410
cannabis college to give yourself some

549
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
credentials there and then you went and

550
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,220
applied and you were hired immediately

551
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,559
let's find where I was in the email it

552
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,759
says so I moved from one location to

553
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,349
another I'm going to leave out your

554
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:52,329
locations because I want to keep you

555
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:53,769
safe I don't know who may hear this down

556
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:55,269
the road we don't want to put you in any

557
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,579
jeopardy so we're gonna keep all your

558
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:59,650
locations and names kind of secret but

559
00:18:57,579 --> 00:19:01,569
it says I've moved location since then

560
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,340
and that's where this new business is

561
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:06,819
located and I've been here for two years

562
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:09,309
I am now leading a building with

563
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:10,839
multiple rooms that are this size I'm

564
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:12,909
not gonna say that because that is those

565
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,230
are too many clues other people who hear

566
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,019
this they'll know that this is you I

567
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:20,099
says I've got a hundred or so plant in

568
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:24,730
each room I have rich 80 to 90 pounds

569
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:26,829
dry weight per 18 HPS lights per room so

570
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,940
you're saying you get 80 to 90 pounds

571
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:33,399
out of 18 HPS lamps per room I'm really

572
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,870
curious how long your vegging I'm really

573
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,660
curious how you're doing that deep water

574
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:38,889
culture hydro soilless mix are you on

575
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,050
tables I want to know about your

576
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,670
genetics I'm trying to do the math in my

577
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,099
head quickly while I'm talking that's

578
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,779
over 3 pounds per light that's 3.6

579
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:48,490
pounds per light I'm actually gonna pull

580
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,230
out a calculator here and do that let's

581
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,230
see what this says we were going to

582
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,539
divide 90 pounds divided by 18 lights

583
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,670
it's 5 pounds okay I did poor math in my

584
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,500
head there but we got 5 pounds per light

585
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,870
that's [ __ ] impressive I would like

586
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,910
to believe you doesn't sound

587
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:04,769
very likely let's keep reading to be

588
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,480
completely honest man I only know what

589
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,460
this company has taught me and from of

590
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,049
Sun and from some of the old heads with

591
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,840
that being said I don't know if it's

592
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:15,359
good decent or super bad if you were

593
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,099
genuinely pulling four to five maybe six

594
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,079
pounds per light that's impressive you

595
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:20,549
need to keep doing that again I can't

596
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,439
see the quality of the product I don't

597
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:24,240
know if you're even trimming it it could

598
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,920
be fluffy and larva [ __ ] I could pull

599
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,870
you five pounds perlite if I don't trim

600
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,160
it but I don't know if anybody wants

601
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:31,558
that I'm gonna do math again just to

602
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,040
make sure I did that right on 90 pounds

603
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:37,259
divided by 18 lights one's [ __ ] five

604
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,450
pounds of light bro that's very unlikely

605
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:41,308
very uncommon ah you should be getting

606
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,690
bonuses and a lot of money if you were

607
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,460
doing that for the company that is

608
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,720
unheard of I'm not gonna say it's

609
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,179
unheard of that's [ __ ] unheard of

610
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,339
dude we like to push for two maybe three

611
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,800
pounds per light five pounds is a little

612
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:54,029
bit ridiculous Congrats if you're really

613
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,440
pulling that but I want to see the

614
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:57,058
product I want to see how its trim don't

615
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,830
want to see how many sticks and stems

616
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:00,299
are left in there I'm not doubting you

617
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:02,159
I'm just questioning you there's a

618
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,440
slight difference not much though I'm

619
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,450
gonna continue where am I it says he

620
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,070
doesn't know if he's doing good decent

621
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,569
or super bad your harvest weight is

622
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:11,369
great I can't tell you anything else

623
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:14,009
about the quality of the product I'm

624
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:16,379
gonna go on it says with that being said

625
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:18,119
I know now that legalization in Florida

626
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,280
is coming up and I have two investors

627
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:23,609
which believe in me and they want to

628
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,710
open a shop once the laws allow so

629
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:27,240
Florida is about to legalize it sounds

630
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,789
like and he's got some people behind him

631
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,500
and this guy wants to open up shop he's

632
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,940
working for somebody now he's pulling

633
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,679
good weight but he's got some investors

634
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,539
that want to pull him away and give him

635
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,519
his own building it sounds like this is

636
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:40,170
a common thing this happens a lot it's

637
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,109
called recruiting here's what I call it

638
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:45,090
it says am i approaching the industry

639
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:47,428
the right way should I get any specific

640
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:48,990
degrees am i at a disadvantage for only

641
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:51,330
knowing how to grow commercially I

642
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,650
really don't think any specific degree

643
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:54,419
would help you out maybe some kind of

644
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,100
business degree because you're going to

645
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,420
need to learn how to manage business and

646
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:59,189
stuff just if you're involved in the

647
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,990
business you want to learn maybe go to

648
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,490
school just for the basics of business

649
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,929
and understand that so you don't get

650
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,750
ripped off once you get in business

651
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:09,090
people with degrees they can rip you off

652
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,470
just on purpose and there's not [ __ ] you

653
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:11,879
can do about it they could do it in a

654
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,890
contract right in front of you and

655
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,580
they'll say this is where I [ __ ] you and

656
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,659
you'll sign the pay

657
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:17,398
because you don't know that that's where

658
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,260
they wrote this is where I [ __ ] you so

659
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:21,989
learn a little bit about business learn

660
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,548
that stuff then are you screwing

661
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,500
yourself by only knowing how to grow a

662
00:22:23,548 --> 00:22:27,298
commercial you know that's your goal you

663
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,589
are meant to be a commercial grower if

664
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:30,629
that's what this new business is going

665
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:33,148
to be so focused on commercial growing

666
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,250
dial it in learn as much as you can

667
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:36,839
every aspect of commercial growing it

668
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,950
sounds like if you're really pulling the

669
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,428
weight that you have typed here in these

670
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,840
numbers

671
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:42,360
it sounds like you've got commercial

672
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,038
growing figured out again you can pull

673
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,750
90 pounds out of the room but if you

674
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:47,250
don't trim it right your it and package

675
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,548
it and get it to the store and doesn't

676
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,528
sell by the gram at 80 to 90 or 80 90

677
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:53,908
pounds if that cash doesn't come into

678
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:55,950
the cash right sure it doesn't count so

679
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:58,019
being able to produce that much it's got

680
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,580
to be quality as well I want to see the

681
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:02,159
product I'm really curious about that

682
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:04,138
but learn how to function in a business

683
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,269
you're gonna have to go from a STONER

684
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:07,829
from a grower from a cultivator you're

685
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:09,538
gonna have to step up your mindset and

686
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:11,970
start learning a little bit more

687
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:14,369
business thought not just managing your

688
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,139
own but also working with other business

689
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:17,609
owners and working with the investors

690
00:23:16,138 --> 00:23:20,490
you're gonna be playing with a lot of

691
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:23,158
money learn how to not take the money

692
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:25,230
and the pressure as stress just think

693
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,789
about think about it as this is what I'm

694
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,889
doing and I know how to do it I'm

695
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:30,898
confident so we will be successful but

696
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:32,250
at the same time know how to make wise

697
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:34,229
decisions you're gonna have to do a lot

698
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,849
of thinking and a lot of planning so I

699
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,649
don't recommend any specific degrees

700
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:40,158
just think about a lot of things and

701
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:42,750
open your mind step out of the the

702
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,970
closet grower or the small mind

703
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,859
cultivator and start thinking a million

704
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,190
dollar cultivation and everything you're

705
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,138
doing

706
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,370
you just have to dial in every detail a

707
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:52,469
little better don't let it stress you

708
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:54,719
that much more just step up your game

709
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,940
that much more go the opposite don't let

710
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,139
it scare you make it make you better

involved in just because you're the

731

gonna try to say where am I now some

745
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,500
[ __ ] way rambley again am i at a

746
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:02,579
disadvantage by only knowing how to grow

747
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,410
commercial you know that's what your

748
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:05,250
goal is I just honestly want to know

749
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,990
where I'm at

750
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:10,200
should I write it out with this company

751
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:14,069
or should I not venture it out with them

752
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,140
and have them as my competition don't

753
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:17,639
ever worry about competition in business

754
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,440
there are always going to be other

755
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,600
businesses that is how business works

756
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,670
without competition you will fail you'll

757
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,379
be the only one your ego will get too

758
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,820
big you'll run out of product something

759
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,800
will go wrong if you're the only one

760
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:31,200
have a little competition that's healthy

761
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,639
but I can't tell you where to stay I

762
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,870
can't tell you if you want to stay in

763
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,060
the facility in which you're working

764
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:38,339
with now or if you want to step out to

765
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:40,289
another facility and take the reins and

766
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:42,059
have that much more control also that

767
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,529
much more responsibility you're gonna

768
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,169
have to learn how to juggle that in your

769
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:47,700
own life where that fits in for you but

770
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,289
don't go in thinking that anybody is

771
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,539
your competition don't make an enemy

772
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:53,819
mindset don't make a battlefield mindset

773
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,379
we're the cannabis community you may be

774
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,970
different businesses you may be doing

775
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,400
things differently but we all have the

776
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,650
same goal so even if you do end up on

777
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,269
the other team we are all headed to the

778
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,830
top of Mount Everest mountain climbers

779
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:06,509
aren't competing against anybody but

780
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:08,369
themselves even though there are other

781
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:09,869
climbers out there they don't give a

782
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:11,429
[ __ ] what the other climbers are doing

783
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:12,750
they just want to get to the top if

784
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,700
another climber Falls they're gonna help

785
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,410
but they're not worried about oh that

786
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,029
climber is going up the mountain more

787
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,130
quickly than me they just say I'm gonna

788
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:21,509
get to the top when I get there so you

789
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,070
do that for you don't worry about the

790
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:24,720
other climbers you do your [ __ ] thing

791
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,519
and that goes for just about everything

792
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,200
in life don't compete with anybody but

793
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,910
yourself because you are your only gauge

794
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,259
of your own success and who knows what

795
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,640
the other people have gone they may look

796
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:34,230
like they're winning the race but they

797
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,490
may have [ __ ] their pants and if they

798
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,140
win the race with [ __ ] in their pants

799
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,730
they still lost so if you didn't [ __ ]

800
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,070
your pants and you win the race second

801
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,118
place you win so don't judge your

802
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:43,648
success by

803
00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:45,208
anybody else's success just cuz they're

804
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:47,368
doing something differently doesn't mean

805
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:48,599
they're winning I'm gonna try to get

806
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:50,368
back on track here all right

807
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:52,348
um this person is wondering if they

808
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:54,058
should branch out and then they want to

809
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:56,489
know is my knowledge that I know now

810
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:58,078
enough to have my own little successful

811
00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:00,028
shop in the future I don't know exactly

812
00:26:58,078 --> 00:27:01,618
what you know from the size of the grow

813
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:03,568
you said you were running you've got

814
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:05,458
multiple rooms that are a good size

815
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:07,348
you've got quite a few plants in there

816
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:09,089
you were running with this math you're

817
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:10,138
running close to 2,000 plants I don't

818
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:12,388
know how many people you have helping

819
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:14,578
you I don't know if this is a multi

820
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:16,438
person facility or a one-man show if

821
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:19,618
you're doing that on yourself on your

822
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:21,839
own I would rely on you to be a quality

823
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:23,519
lead cultivator you could probably lead

824
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:25,618
a team you could certainly manage a

825
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,388
decent-size facility you can do whatever

826
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:28,528
you need to do if the things you were

827
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:30,868
telling me are accurate if you're

828
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:32,568
pulling 80 to 90 pounds at 18 lights

829
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:34,678
you're doing better than most

830
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,178
professional cultivators in a lot of

831
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,679
facilities that have been around for

832
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,479
quite a while I don't want to boost up

833
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,949
your ego because I have not seen the

834
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:43,048
quality of the product you got a past

835
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:44,849
lab testing do you understand do you

836
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:47,939
understand pesticide applications and

837
00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:49,558
pesticide safety are you compliant there

838
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:51,479
are a lot of other things to think about

839
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:53,219
but that is all legal stuff that is

840
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:55,499
gonna happen to you if you choose to

841
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:57,179
work with your own company or stay with

842
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:58,528
the folks you're working with now so I'm

843
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,019
not sure what to tell you I can't make

844
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:02,608
business decisions for you my friend he

845
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,259
says my family has always frowned upon

846
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:06,269
cannabis and I want to make the

847
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:08,189
difference and prove them wrong that I

848
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:11,308
can be a successful young man while

849
00:28:08,189 --> 00:28:14,159
cultivating cannabis again I admire your

850
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:16,229
passion that you want to be a successful

851
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,569
cannabis cultivators but let's not do

852
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:21,119
something just to prove somebody wrong

853
00:28:18,568 --> 00:28:23,249
prove yourself right prove your passion

854
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:25,168
is what you should be doing do what you

855
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:27,118
want to do to make your life happy for

856
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:29,159
yourself not to prove anybody else wrong

857
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:30,628
that's a big waste of time because

858
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,249
they're not spending their energy

859
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:34,528
proving you wrong on [ __ ] they don't

860
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:36,088
care they've moved on so don't waste

861
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:38,098
your energy doing something to prove

862
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:40,348
anybody wrong do what you're doing to

863
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:42,269
show what you are passionate about prove

864
00:28:40,348 --> 00:28:43,918
it to yourself that you can do what you

865
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:46,108
set your mind and heart to do so set

866
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,788
some goals and reach those goals he

867
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:50,068
wraps up the message by saying I respect

868
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:53,158
your craft immensely and I am very eager

869
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:55,229
to hear what you have to say I really

870
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,770
gave some weird advice because I can't

871
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:57,630
tell you

872
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,429
to do with your personal life and with

873
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,890
your business life and with your career

874
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:04,350
I don't know what the options are I only

875
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:06,570
see a couple of words on paper I can't

876
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:08,730
see the long-term effects that this will

877
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:10,500
have on your life I would make sort of a

878
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,269
flowchart and this may sound silly for

879
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,359
some people but this is what successful

880
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:17,579
people will do draw a chart and say if I

881
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:21,990
choose decision a what will my life be

882
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:25,259
like in 1 week 2 weeks 6 weeks 2 months

883
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:27,359
3 months 6 months what will my life be

884
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:29,940
like one year from today if I make

885
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,769
decision a what will my life be like in

886
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,049
two years three years five years ten

887
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:36,210
years think about what your life will be

888
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:38,730
like in a certain amount of time from

889
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:42,000
decision a then do the same damn thing

890
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:43,860
for decision B what is best for you and

891
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,690
what is best for your family and what is

892
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:48,029
what you really want you don't have to

893
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,410
decide right now hopefully hopefully

894
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:51,210
you've got a few minutes to sit back and

895
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,100
think about it do whatever you do get a

896
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,819
clear head get a really clear head and

897
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:55,769
think about it

898
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:57,058
then put into your head whatever you

899
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:58,679
like to put in your head and think about

900
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:00,509
it if you want to smoke a fatty smoke a

901
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,890
fatty if you want to drink a beer drink

902
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:04,079
a beer if you want to eat some mushrooms

903
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:06,450
eat those damn mushrooms and think this

904
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,339
decision through then clear your head

905
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,630
again and make a solid decision when you

906
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,459
got a clear head so you think about it

907
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,960
completely sober then you get [ __ ]

908
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,490
wacky out of your brain and think about

909
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,259
it real good sleep on it for a couple

910
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,509
nights come back to it nice and crispy

911
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,769
make a good decision just think about it

912
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:21,599
I can't tell you what to do with your

913
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:23,819
life or I wish I really wish that I

914
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,009
could it is exciting to team up with

915
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:29,220
investors and create your own business

916
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:31,109
you were attaching your entire life to

917
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,150
that business you will wake up and be

918
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:35,009
that business you will fall asleep being

919
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,350
that business you were in you were

920
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:39,269
responsible for a lot of things you were

921
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:41,428
in you're basically having another child

922
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:43,289
if you start this business with other

923
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:45,150
people if you are working with the

924
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:46,889
company that is established that has

925
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,050
owners that has people that handle that

926
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,390
part you have a lot of the stress taken

927
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:53,279
off your back also you have a lot of the

928
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:55,320
paycheck taken off your back you have a

929
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,389
lot of the pride and a lot of the say-so

930
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,519
taken off of your back so you have to

931
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,890
decide what makes you happiest or I

932
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,710
really don't want to make a personal or

933
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,490
a career decision for one of my friends

934
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,990
I want to give you words of

935
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,940
encouragement and make you think about

936
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,388
it and I want to hope that you make the

937
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,070
best

938
00:31:09,388 --> 00:31:13,168
decision for yourself and for your

939
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,489
family I also want to thank you for

940
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:16,169
listening to the show because you have

941
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:17,909
been a longtime listener we've been

942
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:20,159
emailing back and forth for quite some

943
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,839
time you sent me this email a little bit

944
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,209
back so I hope I'm not too late with the

945
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:25,769
reply but I do appreciate the support

946
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:27,479
and I do know that you helped me out on

947
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:29,038
the patreon channel so I want to give

948
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:31,200
you an extra fist bump and an extra

949
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,819
thank you for that and just be confident

950
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,919
that you will make the correct decision

951
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:37,229
and one thing I just thought of is this

952
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,229
cannabis industry is ever-changing and

953
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:42,808
ever-evolving you are a passionate and

954
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:45,058
an educated cannabis grower and you were

955
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:47,548
always going to have some sort of a spot

956
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:50,729
in the commercial cultivation industry

957
00:31:47,548 --> 00:31:53,128
if you choose to do so I am a very

958
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:56,338
qualified commercial grower and I don't

959
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:58,588
spend a long time in the same facility

960
00:31:56,338 --> 00:32:01,918
because things rotate in this industry

961
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:04,138
so drastically so if you were a skilled

962
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,629
cultivator and you can present yourself

963
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:08,758
well if you can write a resume if you

964
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:11,009
can interview well you will never be

965
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:14,190
without a job in the commercial

966
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:16,078
cultivation industry if you decide that

967
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,028
you don't like the way a facility is ran

968
00:32:16,078 --> 00:32:20,848
or that an owner is implementing a new

969
00:32:18,028 --> 00:32:22,588
rule or maybe an investor is being cheap

970
00:32:20,848 --> 00:32:24,808
and not buying the appropriate equipment

971
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:27,118
you can leave that facility and find

972
00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:28,168
employment at another facility in a very

973
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:30,238
short amount of time

974
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:32,849
once the industry is established is

975
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:35,098
actually very easy when the industry is

976
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:38,278
new because everybody needs a qualified

977
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:40,019
grower so don't be too afraid to jump in

978
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,298
somewhere do what you need to do for a

979
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:44,429
little while learn learn that style

980
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:45,808
every facility does something different

981
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,969
just because that's how they do it

982
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:49,828
they've got a lead cultivator that set

983
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:51,989
it up with an idea or they've got an

984
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:53,578
owner that set it up with an idea and

985
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:55,528
you've got to adapt to that so you will

986
00:32:53,578 --> 00:32:57,569
learn things in every facility so don't

987
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:59,459
be afraid to leave something for

988
00:32:57,569 --> 00:33:01,138
something better but if you are stable

989
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:03,149
and secure and you need to take care of

990
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:05,788
a family always keep that in mind as

991
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:07,738
well but don't be afraid there are jobs

992
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:10,169
in the commercial cultivation industry

993
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:12,450
and when one ends there's always another

994
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:14,820
one available just be careful of your

995
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,219
reputation because the community does

996
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:19,108
get quite small quite quickly we all

997
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:22,499

00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:15,839
every day while working and I have

1055
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:17,969
learned so much perfect I'm hitting my

1056
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,680
goal I want to teach people so I'm doing

1057
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:22,049
it right it says English is not my

1061
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:32,610
English is better than most Americans so

1062
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,710
congratulations a good job there it goes

1063
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:36,579
on to say I am on my first grow using

1064
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,440
LED lighting and a

1065
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:41,860
wrote in that is in my room in my

1066
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,349
apartment the tent is 23 inches by 23

1067
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:47,230
inches by 60 inches so we've got about 2

1068
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:50,079
feet by 2 feet by 5 feet and it goes on

1069
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:52,000
to say I am concerned about light leaks

1070
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,920
I have listened to your podcast and I

1071
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,860
know light leaks are something to be

1072
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,170
careful about I also know that a tent

1073
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,150
needs good ventilation both of these

1074
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,710
things are correct when we have our

1075
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,110
plants in their dark period we need to

1076
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,389
keep the dark period under uninterrupted

1077
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:09,370
and that means zero light if there is

1078
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:10,690
any light on that plant you are going to

1079
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:13,269
have problems that will give you

1080
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,519
potential hermaphrodites which will mess

1081
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:18,639
up your crop that is undesirable so we

1082
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:20,559
want zero light absolutely zero light

1083
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,889
when people say is this too much light

1084
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,750
yes any light too much zero light I mean

1085
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:27,730
zero I want you to go in there and close

1086
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,289
your eyes and put your hand directly in

1087
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,000
front of your face and not be able to

1088
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:32,769
see your hand I want you to wait for

1089
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,989
like ten minutes I want your eyes to

1090
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:36,340
adjust I want you to look around and

1091
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:38,199
look for little leaks are there any

1092
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,700
little prick holes in the material where

1093
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:42,129
lights come in and we cannot have any

1094
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:44,619
light so this is absolutely correct zero

1095
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:47,349
light leaks that is a absolute thing to

1096
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:49,779
be concerned about this person also said

1097
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:51,579
that they need correct ventilation which

1098
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,380
is absolutely correct so they have been

1099
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:55,719
listening to the show and I am proud of

1100
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,090
them so far so let's keep moving it says

1101
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:00,250
right now my ceilings are getting fresh

1102
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:03,400
air from the bottom of my tent

1103
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:07,179
which has the classic duct holes in and

1104
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,619
out for aeration I simply put a fan in

1105
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:10,779
front of the hole so we're just blowing

1106
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:12,730
air straight into the little mesh right

1107
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,200
there which works beautifully that mash

1108
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,760
is gonna slow down the wind so it

1109
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,679
doesn't disturb the seedlings too much

1110
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,080
and we're gonna get some air exchange so

1111
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,730
far we're off to a good start the

1112
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,500
message goes on to say but when it's

1113
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,659
time for flowering I'm going to have to

1114
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,820
shut down this vent so the light won't

1115
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:29,670
come in because my tent is in a room

1116
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,440
which can be illuminated illuminated

1117
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:35,170
sometimes because I store things in this

1118
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,849
room that is a common problem we do have

1119
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,980
our grow tents in rooms where we have to

1120
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:42,519
frequently turn off the regular light in

1121
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,260
in the room it also goes on to say what

1122
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,300
about fresh air so he's got to close up

1123
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,860
the vents but they are now concerned

1124
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,440
about fresh air because they don't want

1125
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,539
light coming in through that bottom flap

1126
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,639
it says how's the fresh air going to

1127
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:57,130
enter the tent this may sound like an

1128
00:37:54,639 --> 00:38:00,129
ultimate noob question but I really do

1129
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,440
not know how to solve this then it goes

1130
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,750
on with maybe is it possible in a small

1131
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,059
tent like this that I don't use a fan by

1132
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,590
the way I plan to grow two plants and I

1133
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:11,650
want to keep them pretty small

1134
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:13,960
I do not care at all about having a huge

1135
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,880
yield with great taste or [ __ ] I

1136
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,730
actually do not smoke but I want to grow

1137
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,890
some high CBD plants with my very

1138
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,300
occasional migraine it's okay so we're

1139
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:24,879
growing CBD plants to help with

1140
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,650
migraines and also just growing because

1141
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,530
I love the plant and I love growing

1142
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,150
outdoors or indoors excuse me so this

1143
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,250
person is just growing basically for the

1144
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,230
passion of growing this could just be an

1145
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,460
act of civil disobedience if they are in

1146
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,309
an illegal place which I would

1147
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,240
definitely admire um there's more than

1148
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:42,070
we're gonna wrap it up and we'll answer

1149
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,289
the question I hope I made myself clear

1150
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,809
actually listening to your podcast helps

1151
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,409
also a lot in learning English hey that

1152
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:49,929
is great

1153
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:51,940
your English is beautiful you did a

1154
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:54,099
wonderful job you did better than most

1155
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,070
Americans do with their emails your

1156
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:59,110
message was very easy to read I really

1157
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,670
like the idea that I am helping you

1158
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:03,519
learn English I like to think that I

1159
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,230
speak fairly well for a lazy American so

1160
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,239
thank you I hope you're learning well

1161
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,820
from me he wraps it up with cheers from

1162
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:11,679
France also I may be a bit paranoid so

1163
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,840
please do not use my name because weed

1164
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,389
consumption and cultivation are highly

1165
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,100
prohibited here so I won't say your name

1166
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:20,980
at all but big thank you for the email

1167
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:24,039
and big thank you and fist bump for your

1168
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:27,010
act of civil disobedience by illegally

1169
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:30,279
cultivating your medicine there in the

1170
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:32,590
great country of France so let's talk a

1171
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,480
little bit about now how to get air into

1172
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,329
that tent once we need to close that

1173
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,940
vent so the light does not come in there

1174
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:42,400
are a couple of simple solutions I would

1175
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,980
definitely recommend some sort of an

1176
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,250
extraction fan on the top of that tent

1177
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:50,199
to remove the heat and humidity from the

1178
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,539
tent we need a way to get that old air

1179
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,029
out and the general way to do that is to

1180
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:58,059
put an extraction fan at the top there

1181
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,310
is probably a hole or a duct or a port

1182
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:03,219
on the top of that tent so I would put a

1183
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:04,150
blower up there sucking air out and it

1184
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:06,099
would just pull the

1185
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,079
hot air out of that little tent and it

1186
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:09,909
would just dump it into that room into

1187
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,489
the bedroom or into the storage room or

1188
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:15,009
you've got the tent now as that fan or

1189
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:16,689
that blower pulls air up to the top of

1190
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,670
that tent and out of the top of the tent

1191
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,289
it is going to need to replace the air

1192
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,019
somewhere that air will need to come

1193
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:24,940
from somewhere the tent will crush in a

1194
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:26,530
little bit that is okay that negative

1195
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,599
pressure is not a problem I've talked

1196
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,250
about this in another episode the tent

1197
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:32,500
will cave in just a little bit that is

1198
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,269
okay once the pressure gets strong

1199
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,610
enough the air will start flowing

1200
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:38,590
through the gaps in the tent there are

1201
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,420
gaps in the zipper there are gaps in

1202
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:42,309
little spots in the tent that the air

1203
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,349
will find its way through so it will

1204
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:46,059
suck right through there also you don't

1205
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:48,190
have to velcro those flaps down

1206
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:49,960
completely tight you can velcro them

1207
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,550
down to where the light doesn't get

1208
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,679
through but they can still be open

1209
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,690
enough to where the air can pass through

1210
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,599
there so you don't need the fan blowing

1211
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:01,119
in I would put a fan sucking out that

1212
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,400
fan will remove your humidity and that

1213
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,829
fan will also remove excess heat and

1214
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,230
that fan at the same time will help draw

1215
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:10,900
air in through that passive vent on the

1216
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,539
bottom and keep recycling and refreshing

1217
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,400
the air in the tent now keep in mind you

1218
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:17,289
can only refresh it with the air that is

1219
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,300
available in that storage room so I

1220
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:21,070
don't know how often that air gets

1221
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,440
exchanged I don't know how large that

1222
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,330
room is it must be decent because you're

1223
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,369
growing in there but keep in mind that

1224
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:29,349
that room is what is supplying your grow

1225
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:32,409
tent with all of its environmental and

1226
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:34,750
atmospheric conditions your co2 your

1227
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:37,329
oxygen your temperature your humidity

1228
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,070
they are all coming from that room so

1229
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:41,500
that is going to have a lot to do with

1230
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:43,180
the climate inside of that tent so you

1231
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,159
do need to worry about the light leaks

1232
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:47,440
but I think if you just let the flap

1233
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:48,819
down and velcro it at the corners but

1234
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,610
don't do it all the way across the

1235
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:54,340
bottom then put an extraction fan at the

1236
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:56,680
top maybe a four inch fan a 4 inch

1237
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:59,230
blower like a squirrel cage blower or a

1238
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:01,179
four inch it's just an extraction fan to

1239
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,800
go at the top set that in there you can

1240
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:04,629
just set it right on top it probably

1241
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,580
doesn't weigh too much it'll just set

1242
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,320
right on top and rest there make it to

1243
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:10,029
where it is sucking air out and that's

1244
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,980
gonna dump the air into your storage

1245
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,660
area but that will also make the air

1246
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,070
flow through that tin it'll come right

1247
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:16,750
through the passive vents in the bottom

1248
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,590
it will also come through the gaps in

1249
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,969
the zipper

1250
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,920
through any gaps in the stitching

1251
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,989
they'll go right up out of the top and

1252
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,700
then I'll just recycle into the room no

1253
00:42:22,989 --> 00:42:27,609
I would try to keep the lights on

1254
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:28,929
minimally in that room I understand that

1255
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,430
you have to visit that room to get

1256
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:32,289
things you say here that it's used as a

1257
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:35,079
storage room you're gonna have to get in

1258
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:37,389
there occasionally maybe try to plan

1259
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:39,250
your lights off schedule around times

1260
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:41,230
when you are sleeping or times that you

1261
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,909
won't have to visit that room try to

1262
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,369
think about what hours of the day do I

1263
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:47,170
go into that room I wake up at this time

1264
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:49,480
of day I go to bed at this time of day

1265
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,680
so that's only it's probably 16 hours of

1266
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,179
the day you're probably sleeping eight

1267
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:54,129
hours don't we only got to think about

1268
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:56,109
four hours that we don't want to go in

1269
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,700
there maybe cut four hours at this end

1270
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,170
of the day or four hours at this end of

1271
00:42:57,699 --> 00:43:00,609
the day and time it around that it's

1272
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:02,590
where you don't have to interrupt that

1273
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:04,570
room that's part of being a grower we

1274
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:07,090
have to plan around that stuff so just

1275
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:09,130
try to schedule your lights off time

1276
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:11,590
around times that you won't have to turn

1277
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,420
on that light also most of the time

1278
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:16,420
those tints are well enough made where

1279
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,010
we won't get much light leakage a good

1280
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,349
way to see if you are getting a white

1281
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,450
leak is to turn off the lights in your

1282
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:24,699
storage room turn on the lights in the

1283
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:26,500
grow tent seal the tent up like normal

1284
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:28,629
and just hang out for a few minutes in

1285
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,670
that dark room and see if any little

1286
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,349
pricks of light come shining out if you

1287
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,700
can see little dots of light you may

1288
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:35,170
need to put a piece of duct tape or

1289
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:37,539
something over that just the stop light

1290
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:40,210
from going the other way also keep in

1291
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:42,519
mind the light in your storage area is

1292
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,769
nowhere near as bright as the light

1293
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:46,989
inside of your grow space so if it's

1294
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:48,880
making an out it still may not be making

1295
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:51,639
it in because that light is nowhere near

1296
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,470
as intense so it sounds like the main

1297
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:55,359
solution is going to be putting a small

1298
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:57,639
blower at the top of the tent that way

1299
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,640
we can suck air out and at the same time

1300
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:03,009
pull air in and also try to adjust our

1301
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,989
lighting our daily schedule around our

1302
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,880
lighting schedule of our grow tent so we

1303
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:08,979
don't cause any problems I understand

1304
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,690
sometimes that's a struggle but the tent

1305
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,000
should be well-made enough to where we

1306
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,530
don't get light leaks and if not then we

1307
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,199
can use some duct tape or something

1308
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,940
similar to plug up any light leaks that

1309
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,619
way we don't get hermaphrodites that way

1310
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:23,440
we don't ruin the garden that way

1311
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:24,759
we can have a successful grow ladies and

1312
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,170
gentlemen I think you can hear my throat

1313
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,940
burning out so it's time to start

1314
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30,369
