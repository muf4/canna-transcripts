00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,639
topic of this podcast because this

92
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,649
seasonal affective disorder also known

93
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,269
as sad also known as winter depression I

94
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,030
want to talk about winter depression and

95
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:39,480
feeling sad and ways that some cannabis

96
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,800
may help us out with this um why do I

97
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,988
want to come up with a podcast about

98
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,450
SADS because lately I have felt this

99
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,030
funk in my head I blending it on this

100
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:49,799
whether I'm a California person I'm from

101
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,050
Southern California I grew up right near

102
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,219
the beach boy oh yeah that was [ __ ]

103
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,050
stupid right but it's okay because I

104
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:56,909
meant it I'm seriously from the beach I

105
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,380
grew up 20 minutes from the beach I used

106
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,879
to go to Bolsa Chica Beach I used to go

107
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,799
to Huntington Beach I used to go to Seal

108
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,349
Beach I used to be all over the beach

109
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,030
bro lifeguard stand 23 at Bolsa Chica

110
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,259
beach used to be the spot it's where the

111
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,789
waves are ripping it's where the kids

112
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,530
could go do whatever we want swear the I

113
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:11,400
was a young kid is where the older kids

114
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,409
can go smoke some dope

115
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,120
even older kids would drink beer nobody

116
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,060
gave a [ __ ] what we did I'm a beach kid

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,168
I miss that constant sunshine I miss

118
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,569
just that vibe I live in Colorado now in

119
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:27,000
about October November ish it gets

120
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:28,889
[ __ ] cold and they gets really dark

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,300
the days get really

122
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:32,639
sure it feels like I feel like the days

123
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,020
didn't get as short in California when

124
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,300
the winter comes the day's feel shorter

125
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,278
in Colorado that just could be maybe

126
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,889
being older or not being a kid but it's

127
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:43,050
[ __ ] with my head you guys these dark

128
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,718
cold winter months you can't go outside

129
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,340
and do what you'd normally do I it's a

130
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:49,199
little slower you got to get up early

131
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,998
for work you got a defrost the car joe

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,499
rogan put it best joe rogan said there

133
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:55,289
are states that are called he calls them

134
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:56,460
the [ __ ] states because when you get in

135
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:57,568
your car to go to work in the morning

136
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:59,638
you spend three or four minutes sitting

137
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,500
there going [ __ ] [ __ ] cuz you're so cold

138
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,000
your body can't do anything stomach

139
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,620
muscles tighten up your brain starts

140
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,550
twitching your neck gets all stiff and

141
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,990
you just gotta wait for the car to

142
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,319
defrost and so that you could drive to

143
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,699
work that [ __ ] sucks snow drives me

144
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,009
crazy I don't like the cold I don't like

145
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,750
the snow it feels to make me it seems to

146
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,538
feel like it makes me weak and slowed

147
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,269
down it makes my bones and muscles hurt

148
00:05:17,538 --> 00:05:22,709
I'm dealing with it I'm not enjoying the

149
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:23,848
winter I've got a lot of good friends I

150
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:25,109
do a lot of cool [ __ ] so don't let it

151
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:26,639
slow me down but I do feel it in the

152
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,830
back of my head gone bro something sucks

153
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,990
and it's just this seasonal

154
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,490
effectiveness disorder I want to talk

155
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,680
about a couple things that winter

156
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,060
depression comes along with and then

157
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,158
we'll move into the cannabis part of

158
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,139
this I did a little research it says it

159
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:41,338
usually lasts from fall to spring ish so

160
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,348
if you're feeling a little funky from

161
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:45,028
fall to spring this is probably why

162
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:47,579
especially if you live in these winter

163
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:49,588
colder climates some symptoms of this

164
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,718
seasonal affective disorder include

you think you've got some winter

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,598
seasonal depression we can help you with

192
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,209
some cannabis suggestions another

193
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,838
symptom here would be some laziness just

194
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,728
low-energy

195
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:44,199
lethargy no desire to get out of

196
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:45,878
you just want to lay around put some

197
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,829
blankets over you maybe plan your phone

198
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,400
and not do a damn thing losing interest

199
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:55,058
in life that's sort of a a an effect of

200
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,888
the winter depression here a lot of

201
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:59,110
people have no desire to eat when this

202
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:00,610
winter depression comes on but oddly

203
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,520
enough the internet says that people

204
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,528
will seek foods like carbohydrates and

205
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,598
such during the winter which is odd for

206
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:09,430
me because I always like carbs I like

207
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,319
pizza and pasta and [ __ ] but it says

208
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,059
that you're gonna seek out carbohydrate

209
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,189
type salty foods if you were

210
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:16,749
experiencing seasonal effectiveness

211
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:20,949
disorder it says you're gonna be

212
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:23,319
agitated and irritable which I am there

213
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,598
that's partly how I'm noticing this I'm

214
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,370
partly I feel more tired I feel grouchy

215
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,110
I feel [ __ ] annoyed and I'm pretty

216
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,038
sure that it's mostly just this seasonal

217
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,569
affective disorder another thing that

218
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,699
the internet said that I totally relate

219
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:38,278
to and this is kind of what inspired me

220
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,809
to want to talk about this because it's

221
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:43,209
part of where we are in this new

222
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:45,039
generation this new part of life they

223
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:48,818
said that this seasonal effectiveness

224
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,139
disorder comes with panic attacks and I

225
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,649
think there's a reason for these panic

226
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:55,810
attacks that we're getting now as humans

227
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:59,199
we are too attached to our computers and

228
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:02,528
our devices and as humans we have become

229
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,139
completely lazy and complacent in the

230
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:08,588
winter I think that there's something

231
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:10,870
inside of me that gives me this trigger

232
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:13,149
to go hunt and gather food and build a

233
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,879
fire so that I can keep the family warm

234
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:17,620
through the winter but now we all have

235
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,028
jobs that don't require most of us have

236
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,370
jobs that don't require that sort of

237
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:23,528
stuff I work in a grow up but a grow at

238
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:27,129
6:00 in the morning I do grow stuff I

239
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:29,319
leave there at 6 p.m. I come home I play

240
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,870
on my computer I live in a house I Drive

241
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,418
a car my food all comes from a store I

242
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,860
think that as humans we were supposed to

243
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:37,778
we were designed and built to be out

244
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,519
there hunting our food we should be I

245
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:41,078
should be out there chasing down deer or

246
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,629
Buffalo and killing that [ __ ] and

247
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:45,338
dragging it in and then skinning it and

248
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,659
cleaning yes I am a vegetarian and I'm

249
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,949
saying this this is part of why I think

250
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,318
humans are [ __ ] up because we're not

251
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:52,240
doing this there's something primal in

252
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:54,458
us that makes us supposed to do that and

253
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,259
in the winter that primal instinct to

254
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,359
survive becomes even stronger be

255
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:00,730
it's harder to survive and in the

256
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,289
environment where I am it's even harder

257
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,580
because it snows I'm not saying that I'm

258
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:05,049
in the worst conditions but I mean we

259
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,400
get snow and it's [ __ ] cold and if

260
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:08,229
you don't have shelter and food and

261
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,250
warmth you will die out there

262
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,440
so our inside our instinct our natural

263
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,840
design is to be hunting and gathering

264
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,820
and you're supposed to be using energy

265
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,889
and adrenaline and that anger that you

266
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,290
feel you wouldn't feel that if you were

267
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,789
throwing a spear at another animal so

268
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:26,439
that you could survive you wouldn't have

269
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:28,240
time to be angry you wouldn't have time

270
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,400
to be depressed you'd be letting out all

271
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,169
that anger through adrenaline through

272
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,970
hiking through stalking an animal

273
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:36,099
through or maybe through gardening if

274
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,050
you were a vegetarian back in the

275
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,610
whatever times I'm talking about maybe

276
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:41,109
you had to spend all of that energy in

277
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,090
the garden and we're not doing that [ __ ]

278
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,980
anymore we're sitting on computers and

279
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,070
we're playing video games and we're

280
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,200
driving up to a window to get our food I

281
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,629
think a lot of that is kind of what's

282
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,310
causing the winter depression for a lot

283
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:55,629
of the males I'm not sure if this

284
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,889
affects women the same way I'm not

285
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:59,409
trying to be sexist I just know it's a

286
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,879
testosterone thing maybe women want to

287
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:03,490
be hunters and gatherers also maybe

288
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,350
women suffer the seasonal effectiveness

289
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,450
disorder for the same reasons but

290
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,800
differently I'm not sure this part is my

291
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,410
opinion the panic attacks and the

292
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,409
hunting rent is all my my own opinion

293
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,639
here but I think we should be using our

294
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:18,129
energy and I'm gonna start talking about

295
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,139
now about things that we can do to help

296
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:22,480
ourselves with this seasonal

297
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:26,019
effectiveness disorder I already talked

298
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,000
about being active ah exercise get out

299
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:29,799
there and do something I hypothetically

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,389
saying I feel like we should be hunting

301
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,069
we should be chasing down an elk or a

302
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:35,259
deer and then we got to kill it with

303
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,450
either spear or a bow and arrow a

304
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,830
recurve bow and you got to go drag that

305
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,180
[ __ ] back to camp and then you got to

306
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,910
skin it you got to get everything out

307
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:44,589
then fire I think being around a fire

308
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,569
makes me feel really good like a

309
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,610
campfire something inside of a campfire

310
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,850
really fixes me especially in this cold

311
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:55,389
weather so get out there and be active

312
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:57,610
build the campfire go camping go hunting

313
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,929
if you're that type of person be

314
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,480
physical something I can really

315
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:03,750
recommend to get you out of a seasonal

316
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,850
affective disorder kind of a funk is

317
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,549
join some sort of organized martial art

318
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,180
or fighting be physical use your body I

319
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:12,159
think a lot

320
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:15,459
what's causing this is pent up body

321
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,379
energy from the winter so get out there

322
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,180
and use your body go join a Brazilian

323
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:21,009
jiu-jitsu class go join a martial arts

324
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:23,620
class go be a wrestler if you're not

325
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:25,539
into that go do some yoga just use your

326
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,149
body use some energy I think it'll

327
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:30,399
really help you out so now let's start

328
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:31,659
talking about before I get to smoking

329
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,370
cannabis I wanna say go for a drive

330
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:34,929
should put on some music and go for a

331
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,419
drive that always fixes my head when I'm

332
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:39,189
a little bit funky ah put on your

333
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:40,449
favorite music some reggae whatever

334
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,709
you're into if you're into some metal

335
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,420
put on some metal turn it up a little

336
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,708
bit too lime just go for a drive that'll

337
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,909
fix your head but I wanted to say go for

338
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,588
a drive before I start talking about

339
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:49,059
consuming cannabis because Michael flip

340
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:51,310
out if I say smoke a joint go for a

341
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:52,869
drive it'll make you feel better so now

342
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:55,569
let's talk about other things

343
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,330
cannabis this is how cannabis can truly

344
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,290
help with the seasonal effectiveness

345
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,350
disorder

346
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:04,569
I think that's smoking sativa dominant

347
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,149
cannabis either flowers or dabs are

348
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,950
going to help fix your mood I've got a

349
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,958
short list of strains here that I have

350
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,300
experimented with personally that I have

351
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,639
found to help uplift my mood and not

352
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,708
make me too anxious or jittery and still

353
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,379
allow me to function and get my job done

354
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,909
and still be like a normal person would

355
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:24,580
still have a nice buzz and nobody could

356
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:26,850
tell how high I am so on this list

357
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,350
number one on this list is Jilly bean

358
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,810
Jilly bean has always put me in a good

359
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,310
mood it's uplifting it makes me walk

360
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:35,439
with a nice little pep in my step it

361
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:38,139
puts a grin on my face Jilly bean will

362
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,370
wipe out any anxiety depression it'll

363
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:42,309
calm me down and put you in a good mood

364
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,570
the next one on that list is tangi yes a

365
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:45,309
lot of people are gonna say Jilly bean

366
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,080
and tangi are the same thing they're

367
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:48,729
very similar strains they have very

368
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,190
similar qualities they taste very

369
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,100
similarly they grow similarly I think

370
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,630
they both put a smile on my face

371
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,540
the next strain on my list is tangerine

372
00:12:55,629 --> 00:13:00,549
haze from soma this is actually sohma's

373
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:03,549
New York City Diesel but there is a

374
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:07,328
phenotype that tastes very tangerine and

375
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:08,679
orange II that tangerine haze is always

376
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,000
been I used to call it my morning

377
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,469
breakfast smoke I'd be like I need my

378
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,240
morning oranges and I would smoke some

379
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,278
Selma's tangerine haze or his New York

380
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,500
City Diesel known as tangerine haze so

381
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,049
there's a group back in the day known as

382
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,208
the devil's harvest crew and they grew a

383
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,859
bunch of stuff and they found a very

384
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:26,018
orangey phenotype

385
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,419
very orangey phenotype of the New York

386
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:29,740
City sour sohma's diesel and they pass

387
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:31,028
that around and call the tangerine haze

388
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,528
that's where it got the name and I found

389
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:34,509
the same phenotype out of a pack and I

390
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:35,708
grew it and I loved it and it always

391
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:38,319
used to put a smile on my face so I

392
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:41,768
think those top three that I listed are

393
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,200
very orangie very citrusy very sativa

394
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,730
yet very light strains when you smoke

395
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,320
them when I smoke them I don't get super

396
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,389
high I can't get high as [ __ ] off of

397
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,940
either of those three strains but I can

398
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:54,338
catch a really killer smiley buzz so

399
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,410
something in that orange chirp is really

400
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:59,500
helping you fix your mood the next green

401
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:01,088
on my list you guys is Cindy 99 shout

402
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,820
out to the Brothers Grimm seed company

403
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:07,000
Cindy 99 has always given me a nice

404
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,379
smiley cerebral uplifting buzz it's just

405
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,528
a mood changer it gives you a little

406
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:12,909
shift I like it it's easy to grow I

407
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:14,500
think it's available again in seed form

408
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:16,990
from our friends at Brothers Grimm you

409
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,259
can possibly pick that up at the dank

410
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,850
team.com I'm another one that's always

411
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,039
uplifting and puts me in a good mood but

412
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,750
is sometimes too much for some people

413
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,278
this one may give you a little panicky

414
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,679
if you get a little jittery in too much

415
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,458
sativa this may be a little too much but

416
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,278
the jack herer

417
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:35,528
has always been a good strain for me it

418
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,240
changes my mood it gives me energy

419
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:39,549
it keeps me upbeat and it makes me

420
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,240
social but it can drive your head a

421
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:41,620
little crazy

422
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,789
if you're somebody that gets too

423
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,159
talkative when you smoke too much

424
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:47,860
cannabis Jack may not be the cross for

425
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,929
you if you need to get social if you're

426
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,579
going somewhere and you're like I gotta

427
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:54,338
go talk to people maybe some Jack will

428
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:55,989
be the one for you another strain that

429
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,160
is always uplifting and puts people in a

430
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,480
good mood and you guys are gonna be

431
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:00,009
surprised that I say this because I've

432
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,409
made plenty of jokes about it but blue

433
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:04,059
dream blue dream is always a good strain

434
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:06,909
for putting you in a good mood for

435
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,319
changing your vibe it's not one of those

436
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:09,759
strains that makes you like want to curl

437
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,470
up into a ball when you get to high

438
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,679
because I've seen people want to do that

439
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,240
blue dream is you can't get too high

440
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:18,338
from blue dream and it's a nice mellow

441
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,198
buzz that's why I make fun of blue dream

442
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,579
I call it stripper weed because it's

443
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,958
that's how high strippers want to get

444
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:24,578
strippers don't get [ __ ] high as [ __ ]

445
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,750
like I do strippers just want to get a

446
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:27,370
little buzz you know spend on the pole

447
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,440
I'm just joking but that's why I call it

448
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,940
stripper weed so basically any kind of a

449
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,000
haze cross you guys most of what I've

450
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,459
mentioned has a haze in it also Jack the

451
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,659
Ripper Jack Herer and Jack the Ripper

452
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,699
have a lot of the same pair

453
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:41,649
Jack the Ripper is a cross of Jack Herer

454
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,900
I strongly recommend some Jack the

455
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,939
Ripper but like I said about the Herer

456
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,740
it could be a bit much for you you guys

457
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,650
it could make some people's head spin if

458
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,639
you're not an experienced smoker so if

459
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,519
you're trying to beat seasonal

460
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,559
effectiveness disorder and you are able

461
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,909
to take a strong heavy sativa dose and

462
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,129
you like to get kind of whirlwind high

463
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:02,139
grab yourself some Jack the Ripper it's

464
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:04,600
available at a lot of dispensaries it's

465
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:06,429
a great tasting cannabis it has a great

466
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,409
high to it and it's usually pretty easy

467
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:09,370
to find because sub cool is a very

468
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,990
popular breeder

469
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,049
since we're talking about sub cool I'm

470
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:15,340
gonna mention vortex I used to get some

471
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,229
vortex

472
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,940
it was wax but it was kind of there was

473
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,250
a different texture of wax from a

474
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,470
dispensary in Denver and I loved the

475
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,389
high from it it made me it gave me

476
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,950
tunnel vision high to where I couldn't

477
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:29,169
pay attention to anything except what

478
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:32,170
was right in front of me but it also put

479
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:33,789
this stupidest smile on my face I really

480
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:36,250
love the way that vortex made me feel

481
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:39,069
again vortex if you were not an

482
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:42,159
experienced vortex made my heart race it

483
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,780
made my heart was going but I loved it

484
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,019
there's something about being too high

485
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,909
like that that I really really enjoy um

486
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:51,519
another strain that is good for the

487
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:53,469
seasonal affective disorder is the lemon

488
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,120
Jeffrey that's a golden goat cross -

489
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,190
it's actually lemon skunk crossed a

490
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,799
golden goat I bred that one it is one of

491
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,830
my favorites to smoke it has been tested

492
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,629
in the 30% range for THC it is

493
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,610
definitely a head changer something

494
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,949
about the orange and lemon Terps the

495
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:11,559
limonene Terps really create like a good

496
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,839
mood a good vibe so I think things that

497
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:15,909
smell like oranges smell like fruit

498
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,399
smell like lemons are usually going to

499
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,709
be uplifting positive vibe kind of

500
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,870
strains I think most of the haze crosses

501
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,240
and the tangi and jellybean crosses are

502
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:27,849
usually going to be good to put you into

503
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,039
a good mood so those are strains that I

504
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:31,619
can recommend for smoking if they are

505
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,960
available where you are

506
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:36,759
if smoking isn't something for you and

507
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,370
if you're not getting the desired effect

508
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:41,589
from smoking edibles may be a better

509
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:43,119
route to go body chemistry is all

510
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:44,949
different so if you're trying to fight

511
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:48,699
depression or seasonal affective

512
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:51,309
depression maybe you need high THC maybe

513
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,090
you need CBD I would kind of stay a

514
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:57,399
away from the indicas what happens to me

515
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:59,169
and I have to go in history because now

516
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,210
I smoke so much and my tolerance is so

517
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,460
high and I'm older and I'm more used to

518
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,500
being high out of my mind when I was

519
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,390
younger and was new at cannabis when I

520
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,279
would smoke sativas I would get that

521
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,509
real psychedelic high and get talkative

522
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,799
sort of like I am now I'm just [ __ ]

523
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:13,629
rambling and talking about everything

524
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,149
but then when I would smoke indicas I

525
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,590
would go in my head and get quiet and

526
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,970
that's when you just sit in a chair and

527
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:21,069
you start thinking too much and I would

528
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,420
kind of sometimes you could drive

529
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,980
yourself crazy thinking too much and

530
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,170
when you're already in the seasonal

531
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,329
effectiveness disorder kind of head

532
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,500
state smoking an indica that's gonna put

533
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:31,149
you into your own head and make you

534
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,950
think may [ __ ] you up a little more than

535
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,230
you need it may cause more depression it

536
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,180
may cause self-doubt it may cause

537
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,640
confusion it may not be the thing that

538
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,490
you need so I would go for some sativa

539
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,650
edibles or CV CBD edibles but I would

540
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,890
definitely stay away from the indica

541
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,440
dominant stuff you guys I think the most

542
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:53,140
reliable cure for seasonal affective

543
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,900
disorder is to smoke a joint and go for

544
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,460
a hike find a nice safe hiking spot roll

545
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,830
yourself up a nice joint of your

546
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,420
favorite strain either the chili bean or

547
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:03,159
some lemon Jeffrey or whatever you can

548
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,560
find that fits in the list that I talked

549
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,019
about it's yourself a nice sativa joint

550
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,119
roll it up take one of your best friends

551
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:12,220
with you take your dog with you get a

552
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:15,099
bottle of water go for a walk

553
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,539
smoke a joint and fix your head and keep

554
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,859
in mind you guys it's okay to feel this

555
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,149
way everybody's gonna deal with some

556
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:20,529
[ __ ] in their life it's all right to

557
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,690
feel kind of funky once in a while just

558
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,460
don't be a dick try to deal with it

559
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,019
properly and pull yourself through it

560
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,940
hopefully when the spring comes he'll

561
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,589
start cheering up again hopefully by the

562
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,940
time 420 rolls around you'll be in a

563
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:32,289
good mood and then summer is coming back

564
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,940
and then it's time to get in a good mood

565
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:36,009
again hopefully you can figure it out

566
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,390
not go through it again next year are

567
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:40,539
