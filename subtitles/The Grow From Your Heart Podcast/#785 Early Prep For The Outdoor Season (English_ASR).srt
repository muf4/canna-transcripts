episode I am going to give away a pack

76
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,739
of seeds the seed giveaway of course is

77
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,140
sponsored by our friends at

of course we will give away those seeds

82
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,439
here toward the end of this episode

83
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,539
before we get to that part let's talk

84
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,120
about the main topic of today's episode

85
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,039
it is January right now as we record

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,140
this episode the middle of January

87
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,359
spring is approaching it is almost time

88
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,679
for the the outdoor season it doesn't

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,900
seem like it's time to start thinking

90
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,280
about that yet we've got five maybe six

91
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,800
months before plants are going outside

92
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,900
but let's get prepared it's never too

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
early to start preparing our ganja grow

94
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,920
if we're going to put plants outside I

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,780
always recommend putting out something

96
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,179
that we have tested at least something

97
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,560
that we have sex tested a lot of Growers

98
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,300
that grow on the coast that are able to

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,219
grow bigger crops they're already

100
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,959
sprouting their seeds already cutting

101
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,539
their clones getting their plants ready

102
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,640
for June and July and August which is

103
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:46,259
six seven eight months away but by the

104
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,958
time it comes time to put those plants

105
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,120
outside they're going to have big beefy

106
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,439
monstrous plants so if you don't have

107
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,060
clones if you don't have something ready

108
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,158
now that you already know is a female

109
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,199
that has been tried and true now is the

110
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,780
time to start prepping and planning for

111
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,339
your outdoor grow the first thing to

112
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,860
think about is do you have a reliable

113
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,400
source for seeds or clones of course you

114
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,720
can get seeds at seedshairnow.com or

115
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,879
iridirect.com do some shopping find what

116
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,259
works best for you but now is the time

117
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,699
to start getting those seeds if you

118
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,680
don't all already have them start

119
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,238
shopping start doing research we're

120
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,160
going to talk about what research needs

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,159
to be done but now is the time to start

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,080
getting those seeds then as soon as you

123
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,300
get those seeds I recommend germinating

124
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,099
them and start vegging them yes it is

125
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,680
very early we've got a lot of time to go

126
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,360
before the outdoor season comes but do

127
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,160
you want to put some random untested

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,199
unvetted seeds Outdoors or would you

129
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,240
like to maybe give them an audition run

130
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,560
run them one time before you put them

131
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,600
outside that way you can do a quick

132
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,939
final hunt find the plant that you like

133
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,259
best then put that one outdoors and make

134
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,120
several clones of it and fill the

135
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,160
outdoor garden with that I understand

136
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,199
not everybody has an indoor garden this

137
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,880
isn't an option for everybody but this

138
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,100
will help you out in the long run if you

139
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,978
are able to do this I recommend getting

140
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,020
a pack of seeds start vegging them now I

141
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:03,000
highly recommend sexing those plants

142
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:05,099
there are many ways to do that you can

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,478
grow them up to big enough to get a

144
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,580
clone from them that's up to you to

145
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,959
determine get a clone then you can

146
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:11,699
either put the original plant into

147
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,219
flower or you can put that clone into

148
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,080
flour within 10 to 14 days days you will

149
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,060
know if you've got male or female plants

150
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,620
you can throw away all the males and all

151
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,540
the male plants and corresponding clones

152
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,519
and keep the females run those and do

153
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,979
that final hunt to find the desirable

154
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,899
phenotype for your area for your needs

155
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:29,819
another way we can do it

156
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,159
we can put these plants Under 12 12

157
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,379
lighting put them into flour for 10 to

158
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,780
14 days and soon enough they will begin

159
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,399
to show you their sex it won't take long

160
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,379
for those plants to start showing you

161
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,599
their sex as soon as you identify males

162
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,519
remove them let them flower until you've

163
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,560
positively identified the sex of all of

164
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,659
those plants then simply put the timer

165
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,780
back to a vegetative state you can go to

166
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,699
24 on and zero off or 18 6 will also

167
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,619
work for you I do my mother plants at

168
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,660
19.5 I like them to sleep a little bit

169
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,759
but I also need to give them extra light

170
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,680
because I've got some tropical varietals

171
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,720
that will try to flower on me if they

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,579
don't get enough light time so those are

173
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,800
two easy ways that you can quickly sex

174
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:09,538
your plants you can cut a clone as soon

175
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,220
as it is time to cut a clone you can

176
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,019
either put that clone dome in the flower

177
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,300
room or you can put the original plants

178
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:16,918
in the flower room within 10 to 14 days

179
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,259
you will have identified the males and

180
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,478
females or you can simply flower out

181
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,160
your original plants and then re-vege

182
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,258
them it won't take long to revert them

183
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,539
back to veg if you're only in flour for

184
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,639
10 14 maybe 17 days it won't take that

185
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:31,019
long to to turn them around they'll also

186
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,340
grow quite large while they're in that

187
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,500
early phase of flower they'll really

188
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,119
take off for you so you can identify sex

189
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,579
that way then as soon as you find the

190
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,740
males remove them from the garden now we

191
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,599
are only working with female plants be

192
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,180
very careful that you do not put male

193
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,860
plants outdoors in the grow and the

194
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,780
outdoor grow this season we don't want

195
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,460
to pollinate other people's grows we

196
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,679
don't need stray pollen around I

197
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,779
recommend to you do not put a male plant

198
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,939
outdoors the way to do that is to sex it

199
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,859
early identify that before they ever

200
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,719
make it Outdoors those male plants

201
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,600
should not ever go Outdoors imagine

202
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,280
vegging a plant for two three maybe even

203
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,379
four months getting that plant the size

204
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,478
of a Volkswagen and then flowering It

205
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,100
Outdoors and 10 or 12 days into the

206
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,779
flowering season you realize that big

207
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,900
ass plant that you dedicated all that

208
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,359
time that energy that space the love the

209
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:21,060
care the nutrients the water the real

210
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,800
estate possibly the felony you dedicated

211
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,120
all of that to a plant that you don't

212
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,520
even get to finish because it's a boy

213
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,098
and you've got to cut it down as soon as

214
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,538
possible so let's sex these plants

215
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:32,699
before we put them outside that's why

216
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:35,038
I'm telling you to order seeds now and

217
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,419
grow them indoors one time if you can I

218
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,818
understand not everybody's got that

219
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:41,098
luxury but ideally let's run them one

220
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,660
time indoors find out which plant in

221
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:44,038
that batch is your favorite you've taken

222
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,139
a clone of it so now you've got a mother

223
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,399
plant of all of the plants in there when

224
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,079
you find your favorite you can remove

225
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,120
the rest keep your favorite make it

226
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,038
bigger make multiple clones of that then

227
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,079
put all of those clones Outdoors so

228
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,180
you've got your ideal phenotype loading

229
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,740
up your outdoor garden now like I've

230
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,418
said before I understand that not

231
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,939
everybody has got an indoor grow space

232
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:05,339
this is not optional for everybody this

233
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,259
is just situational availability if you

234
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,779
can do this do this if not I do have

235
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,699
other options for you I highly recommend

236
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,279
if you can't sex your plants before you

237
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,199
put them outside I recommend feminized

238
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,359
seeds that's right those plants will be

239
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,520
all female seeds there's no difference

240
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,680
in those Femme seeds and rag seeds other

241
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,719
than they will all be females a lot of

242
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,759
people have a lot of a stigma a lot of

243
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,740
myth a lot of problems with feminized

244
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,840
seeds I'm here to tell you there's no

245
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,459
difference in Femme seeds than there are

246
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,079
regular seeds other than the fact that

247
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,418
we have learned how to remove all of the

248
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,219
male pollen from the equation it'll be

249
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:39,598
all girl plants they will perform just

250
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,659
as well as your male plant or your

251
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,580
regular Plants they will you can clone

252
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,620
them you can breed with them they are

253
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,899
just as good they are the exact same as

254
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,120
the regular Plants except we've learned

255
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,940
how to not get the male pollen in that

256
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,620
equation so they will all be females so

257
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,019
I recommend you run female plants

258
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,120
outdoors I currently have lemon Jeffrey

259
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,220
and Golden Goat Femme seeds and very

260
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,899
soon I will restock the orange gasm

261
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,580
Femme seeds so if you're looking for

262
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,620
Quality Femmes in your garden make sure

263
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,360
you do look for lemon Jeffrey look for

264
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,759
the Golden Goat and if you are kind of

265
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,680
patient look out very soon for those

266
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,419
orange gasm seeds that's right we set it

267
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,419
here first on the podcast the orange

268
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:20,519
Chasm restock is coming very soon all

269
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,919
right where we run Femme seeds if you

270
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,839
can if you can't sex your plants indoors

271
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,699
and do a pre-sex test before you put

272
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,160
them outside then I would recommend

273
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,660
running feminine seeds all of those

274
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,519
seeds will be girls you won't have to

275
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:35,100
worry about pulling the males set

276
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,600
yourself up for Success now here is a

277
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,879
crazy idea something I don't talk about

278
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,220
too often but if you want to be creative

279
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,620
you can definitely run some autoflowers

280
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,139
outdoors we have friends who have been

281
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,060
on the podcast who run multiple crops of

282
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:49,679
autoflowers Outdoors they will start a

283
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,958
crop early they'll put it outside

284
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,159
they'll wait two or three weeks use the

285
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,199
rest of the grill and put that outside

286
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,179
that way they've got two crops maybe

287
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,220
even three crops of autoflowers coming

288
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,799
down in the season that we get to grow

289
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,300
one crop this works out very well for

290
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,039
them because then they've got staggered

291
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,599
Harvest that means that in two weeks

292
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,338
they get to cut down this little plot

293
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,980
and then they get to process all that

294
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,660
chop it down trim it do whatever needs

295
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,459
to be done processing is the word get it

296
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:16,019
out of the way then in two weeks we've

297
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,939
got another crop coming then in two

298
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,560
weeks another crop that helps out

299
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,660
because then you don't have one giant

300
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,458
crop to cut down all at once it'll buy

301
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,980
you some time space out your Harvest

302
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:28,439
also I've seen people run one Autoflower

303
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,420
crop outside and one photo period crop

304
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,160
outside you get to cut down those Autos

305
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,559
a little bit early then right after that

306
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,419
your photo period crop is done I've seen

307
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,219
that so think about what is going to

308
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:40,259
work best for you and your environment

309
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,540
in your situation do you want regular

310
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:43,980
seeds do you need Femme seeds or are you

311
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,199
the type of person that is going to run

312
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,420
auto flowers now there's also the other

313
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,160
option of getting clones are you going

314
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:51,899
to get clones from a friend from a

315
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,939
dispensary some are online a clone

316
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,200
vendor maybe they fall out of the sky I

317
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,820
don't know allegedly how you get your

318
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,220
clones but here are things to think

319
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,320
about when you get those clones make

320
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,899
sure you treat them for every bug and

321
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,600
pathogen and Pest and mold possible

322
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,339
think that those those plants have got

323
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,500
every plant disease you could imagine

324
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,540
and treat them for it isolate them don't

325
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,639
put them near the rest of your plants

326
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,919
clean them up and then the thing to

327
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,439
think about is when you get clones

328
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,120
is that clone first of all is it really

329
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,160
what you think it is is it legitimately

330
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,440
properly labeled then the second thing

331
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,539
to think about is somebody else Fino

332
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,640
hunted that clone for you now that may

333
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,439
be great for you but I like different

334
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,299
things than you like and Mike likes

335
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,920
different things than I like and Clint

336
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,139
likes different things than Mike likes

337
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,759
him but we all like similar things but I

338
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,278
don't want to rely on another person to

339
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,720
female hunt my outdoor product for me

340
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,399
that's something that I would like to do

341
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,079
myself so unless you really trust the

342
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,179
person that did that selection for you

343
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,739
you may not get the ideal phenotype that

344
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,778
you're hoping for it may be great for

345
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,159
them in their region in their

346
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,078
environment and their state and their

347
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,578
climate and their Garden in their uh

348
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:58,679
situation everything will be different

349
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:00,419
just a few miles away things are going

350
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,639
to be drastically different so maybe

351
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,139
that phenotype was perfect for them but

352
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,000
it's not going to be perfect for you

353
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,439
that is something to think about all

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,480
right let's move forward a little bit

355
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,820
I've been talking about the right plant

356
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,579
for you uh think about selecting the

357
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,200
right plants for your region uh things

358
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:18,359
to think about is will it finish on time

359
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,820
is it too hot or too cold in your

360
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,620
environment is it too dry or too humid

361
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,660
in your environment does your

362
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,519
environment have does it commonly get

363
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:27,899
powdery mildew in your environment have

364
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,700
you grown Outdoors the last couple of

365
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,440
years do you know people who have grown

366
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,660
outdoors in your region in the last few

367
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,420
years what did they experience what

368
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:38,219
problems past the pathogens did they

369
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:40,259
experience did they get powdery mildew

370
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,180
do they get a certain kind of bug at a

371
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,799
certain time of the year if you talk to

372
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,719
the farmers in your area they will

373
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,819
already know what you need to prepare

374
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,860
for so maybe find the other ganja

375
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,899
farmers in your area join the groups

376
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,759
join the community and find out what is

377
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,500
coming also talk to the other Farmers

378
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,778
the people that are just growing normal

379
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,039
conventional crops the lettuce Farmers

380
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,480
the carrot Farmers I don't know what

381
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,519
they're growing in your neighborhood but

382
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,079
talk to them and see what should I

383
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,240
expect this year they will let you know

384
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,559
now is the time to start researching and

385
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,480
selecting plants that are going to

386
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,759
handle those conditions those problems

387
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,379
and that environment properly you will

388
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,360
see on some breeders websites that they

389
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,799
do say these plants handle powdery

390
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,539
mildew these plants are great and this

391
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,458
region these plants are great in this

392
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:22,139
region you will see things like that on

393
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,239
my website and many other breeders

394
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,639
websites so start doing your research

395
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,500
also go see what other growers in your

396
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,299
area are growing maybe you need the same

397
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,339
strains maybe there's a reason why

398
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:34,078
everybody in that area chooses that same

399
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,600
clone because it does very well there

400
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,759
there's probably a breeder in your area

401
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,680
that is producing seeds that has been

402
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,139
producing seeds for Generations after

403
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,120
generation in that area to make the

404
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,620
perfect strain for that area so maybe

405
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,899
you need to find the breeder in your

406
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,578
area that's got the crop for you I know

407
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,679
that the things I breed here work very

408
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,359
well here of course they're being bred

409
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,278
here so if I spread them out to my

410
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,620
friends grows here we have great success

411
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,620
there's probably somebody like that in

412
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,820
your area now here's something I always

413
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,220
want to talk about when it comes to

414
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,500
planning Outdoors first of all I should

415
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,480
say follow the rules follow the laws if

416
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,278
you're going to plant outdoors know how

417
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,019
many plants you can put out there know

418
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,519
if they've got to be under lock and key

419
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,440
behind a fence if they've got to be

420
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,539
hidden that is up to you I am not your

421
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,639
legal Council I am the guy teaching you

422
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:23,099
how to produce high quality cannabis do

423
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,259
not get yourself or me in trouble while

424
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,060
you were doing that now that being said

425
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:30,179
follow your plant count follow all the

426
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,379
rules but always plant extra

427
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,539
um you're going to lose some you're

428
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:35,519
definitely most likely probably going to

429
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,199
lose some of your outdoor crop you're

430
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,820
going to lose some to weather you're

431
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,699
going to lose some to bugs you're going

432
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,160
to lose some to animals there are also

433
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:46,198
thieves and then maybe even law

434
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,698
enforcement and then hopefully after all

435
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:49,078
of that at the bottom of the list maybe

436
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:51,120
you're on the list and you'll get some

437
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,599
cannabis at the end of this for yourself

438
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,940
but make sure you plant extra because

439
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,379
here here where we are we always lose a

440
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,540
couple of plants I had a friend who had

441
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,159
a big outdoor grow in his backyard and

442
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:03,719
every year the plant right there at the

443
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,399
corner and that plant right there at the

444
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,079
back corner those would be the first two

445
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,519
to disappear and when those started

446
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,958
getting cut down by the thieves we knew

447
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,698
that was when it was time for us to get

448
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,219
out there and actually start harvesting

449
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:15,659
our crop so I've had plants stolen from

450
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,160
my backyards before that's why I don't

451
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:19,860
even bother to grow outdoor cannabis

452
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,419
here my neighbors are 20 feet that way

453
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,579
and 20 feet that way and probably 40

454
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:25,500
feet that way they can all see it the

455
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:26,879
fences are real low it's going to

456
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,320
disappear around here so there's no

457
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,059
point in growing outdoor cannabis here

458
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,100
the thieves are going to come get it but

459
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:35,939
make sure that you plant extra because

460
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,879
like I said bugs animals weather thieves

461
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,519
cops uh who knows what else could go

462
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,720
wrong there could be a great flood I

463
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,339
don't even want to wish I don't want to

464
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,000
jinx you and send other [ __ ] your way

465
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,339
but plant extra and plan ahead

466
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,740
um outdoor can be as simple or as

467
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,240
elaborate as you want to make it it

468
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,278
could be as easy as putting some pots

469
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,320
Outdoors or you could really prep the

470
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,419
soil build a bunch of structure build a

471
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,760
watering system it is up to you the

472
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,620
beauty of it is that sun is so amazing

473
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,480
that sun is free and it is out there so

474
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,820
you should take advantage of that if

475
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,459
you've got the space and the legal means

476
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,440
to do so it's all about how much effort

477
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,759
you want to spend into it but the first

478
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,399
things I would think about definitely

479
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,259
are good genetics if you don't have good

480
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,698
genetics for outdoors or not go you may

481
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,159
not even make it all the way to harvest

482
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,599
or harvest time may come and your plants

483
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,179
might not even be finished it may be

484
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,639
snowing on you maybe Halloween here in

485
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,138
Colorado it snows almost every year on

486
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,360
Halloween the joke is that you've got to

487
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,579
base your Halloween costume around your

488
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,139
jacket and around the snow to I rock the

489
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,778
Chewbacca costume it's always nice and

490
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:41,579
warm but it's going to snow maybe your

491
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:43,439
plants won't even be done by then if you

492
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:45,419
have not selected the appropriate

493
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,680
genetic so choose the right genetics

494
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,740
then the next thing I would think about

495
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:51,000
is probably amending the soil uh the

496
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,919
soil is where the plants are going to

497
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,480
get their energy their life their food

498
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,399
their nutrients that's coming from the

499
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,379
soil unless you plan on feeding your

500
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,019
outdoor crop bottled nutrients I would

501
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:03,120
really invest in amending the soil good

502
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,679
soil I've done several podcasts with

503
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,140
Jesse I've done a lot of other outdoor

504
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,459
episodes and also follow build a soil if

505
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,319
you really want to know about building a

506
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,000
good outdoor soil and getting your

507
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,980
products affordably and getting them

508
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
shipped right to your door build a soil

509
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,740
does not pay me anything for that I just

510
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,058
know it's a great company and they've

511
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,099
got all the shits that you're going to

512
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:21,899
need so build a good soil get that

513
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,759
outdoor soil going then something else I

514
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,419
would definitely consider is something

515
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:30,179
to cover your outdoor plants from storms

516
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:32,040
here in Colorado we get a hail storm

517
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,419
right in the middle of the summer it's

518
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,319
going to be a super nice day and then

519
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,360
you're going to look up and it's going

520
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,558
to be dark as [ __ ] up in the sky the

521
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,819
clouds are going to be all rolling

522
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,740
around and look crazy and you're going

523
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:42,240
to see lightning in about 40 seconds

524
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,400
after that there's going to be hail the

525
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,319
size of golf balls and grapefruits get

526
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,179
the [ __ ] indoors cover your car get your

527
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,460
car in the garage bring the dog inside

528
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,259
but now what about the ganja plants now

529
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,058
is the time before we put those plants

530
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:56,400
Outdoors to start thinking about that

531
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:57,899
hail storm storm the rainstorm the crazy

532
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,280
winds we're going to get I don't know

533
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,179
what comes your way I don't know where

534
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,678
you are

535
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,940
but you're going to get some [ __ ]

536
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,200
weather

537
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,140
um it's their plants are going to be out

538
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,960
there June July August September maybe

539
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,280
October maybe even into later than that

540
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,660
if you depending on what you're going to

541
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,240
do they're going to be out there for

542
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,179
five six months you're going to get at

543
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,339
least one two maybe five or six terrible

544
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,259
[ __ ] nights of weather be prepared

545
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:24,480
for that let's build something to cover

546
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,099
these plants from the hail let's build

547
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,019
something to protect them from the rain

548
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:30,298
let's build a way to protect them from

549
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,859
the crazy winds that do come up be

550
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:33,720
prepared and expect that don't act

551
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,000
surprised when it [ __ ] hails on you

552
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,279
it is going to happen that's what nature

553
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,839
does especially when we all put a bunch

554
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,240
of ganja plants outside nature because

555
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,740
you think so [ __ ] and it just

556
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,819
drops all the ice trays right on your

557
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,339
head and laughs at you that's the way

558
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:49,918
nature works so be prepared plan ahead

559
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:51,418
like I said before set yourself up for a

560
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,640
success we all know the storm is coming

561
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,440
we know that the animals are coming we

562
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,940
know the bugs are coming we know the

563
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,919
weather is coming we know that a thief

564
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,960
is going to think about it be prepared

565
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,700
for all of this [ __ ] you guys so I would

566
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,380
focus on getting good genetics then I

567
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,940
would amend that soil then I would

568
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,679
definitely work on something to cover

569
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,019
and protect those plants it happens

570
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,600
every year it ruins people's crops I've

571
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,339
seen people lose entire Summer's worth

572
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,439
of work and one night due to a hail

573
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:17,819
storm so be prepared for that another

574
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
thing that you should definitely think

575
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:21,538
about in your outdoor garden and

576
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,179
planting your outdoor Garden early is

577
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:26,220
integrated Pest Management what are you

578
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,380
going to do to keep bugs away from your

579
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,319
garden what is going to show up in your

580
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,600
area we all run the risk of spider mites

581
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,399
white flies fungus gnats here in

582
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,139
Colorado in my region we get a lot of

583
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,419
caterpillars that turn into beetles or

584
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,679
they turn into uh the caterpillars they

585
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,440
turn into these little moths they turn

586
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,820
and they lay these uh weird uh cocoons

587
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,019
inside of the buds and then they break

588
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,240
open and they have these little orange

589
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,619
uh that are melon worms or something

590
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,359
they turn into these orange [ __ ]

591
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:52,678
worms and they eat your weed and then if

592
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,479
you smoke those orange worms you get

593
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,679
high as giraffe [ __ ] but I haven't done

594
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,419
that since like high school so don't do

595
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,400
that [ __ ] anymore but think about your

596
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,259
integrated Pest Management strategy not

597
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,179
only insects are you going to get

598
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,099
rabbits are you going to get deer is

599
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,900
there a possibility of bear maybe

600
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,779
there's dogs maybe there's cats think

601
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,400
about all of that [ __ ] and how to

602
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:14,099
humanely keep them away from the grow

603
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,840
let's not hurt uh any of the animals the

604
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,819
bugs the natural life that was there

605
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,220
that land that was there was there

606
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,019
before you it is yours now to grow on

607
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,058
but in the future I don't know whose it

608
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,279
will be so please take good care of that

609
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:27,660
land for the future Generations maybe

610
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,220
you've got kids maybe you don't

611
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,660
somebody's going to have to deal with

612
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,700
that land in the future please don't

613
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,380
[ __ ] it up also something else I should

614
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,779
mention when we're using our pesticides

615
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,580
or integrated Pest Management uh keep

616
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:40,678
your neighbors in mind let's not destroy

617
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:42,899
or damage or ruin their side of the

618
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,640
fence keep that [ __ ] in mind let's not

619
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,380
destroy any of the nature around us

620
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,759
let's uh let's improve it I know we have

621
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,520
to get rid of some bugs we have to be

622
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,200
safe we have to protect our crop but be

623
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,599
respectful to the environment that is

624
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,179
around you so with that being said find

625
00:20:54,599 --> 00:21:01,379
an ideal humane way to keep rabbits

626
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:02,340
chickens dogs cats goats deer bear I

627
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,020
don't know what is in your neighborhood

628
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:05,879
maybe there's a crazy pasta maybe you

629
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,019
got spider monkeys I don't know what is

630
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,940
there but

631
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,519
figure out a way to safely and humanely

632
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,380
keep them away from your plants also

633
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,418
think about thieves oh we need to keep

634
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,100
thieves away from our plants I would

635
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:18,840
never recommend hurting anybody for your

636
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:20,219
ganja plants you will go to jail if you

637
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,659
hurt somebody protecting your ganja

638
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,819
plants depending on what state you're in

639
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,500
you could very well go to jail for

640
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:27,480
Defending Your criminal Enterprise which

641
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,619
is your ganja plant so think about what

642
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,179
you're going to do if somebody comes

643
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:32,699
into that yard one night to take your

644
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,500
plants also keep in mind you've got bait

645
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,759
out there you are never entering a

646
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,380
criminal Enterprise or this sort of

647
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,079
Realm before but now you've got a very

648
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,760
profitable a cash crop a very valuable

649
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,319
commodity in your backyard and people

650
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,259
may want that think about that before

651
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:48,418
you enter this endeavor here before you

652
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,700
even put those plants out there also

653
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,440
I've said this before it is my

654
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,600
responsibility as just a good friend and

655
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,640
as a podcaster to remind you think about

656
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,859
law enforcement is it legal to grow

657
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,299
where you're growing if it's not legal

658
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,219
to grow where you're growing are you

659
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:04,500
ready to face those consequences which

660
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,759
whatever may happen whatever may come

661
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,798
from it now you're going to say No One's

662
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,140
Gonna know however they they gonna know

663
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:11,700
this [ __ ] happens dude maybe uh recently

664
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,620
my basement flooded and I had to have

665
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,480
plumbers and [ __ ] people down in my

666
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,459
basement near where my grow space is

667
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,500
luckily it's legal here in Colorado I've

668
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,759
only got a few [ __ ] plants I just

669
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,558
straight up showed that because it was

670
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,000
easier to be like hey here's this in

671
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,019
here please don't go in this room and

672
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,880
they all looked and they said oh there's

673
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:28,019
plants and it was out of the way I just

674
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,400
showed them you know I mean here just

675
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,779
lift up my dress like let me let you

676
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,820
take a peek that way they weren't

677
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:33,960
curious but I've got my legal amount of

678
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,460
plants down there it's nothing crazy

679
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,679
they went huh and they were bored with

680
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,259
it but maybe it's not legal where you

681
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,820
are so maybe one day the gas guy comes

682
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,859
to check the gas meter or the water

683
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,538
meter or the electrical meter or maybe

684
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:46,979
there's a [ __ ] cop helicopter just

685
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:49,319
happens to randomly fly over your

686
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,460
backyard maybe your neighbors get in a

687
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,418
fight and then the cops go to the

688
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,100
neighbor's house and they're in the

689
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,720
backyard just talking and they go what's

690
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:56,459
that over the fin so it's a big ass weed

691
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,140
plant think about all of the [ __ ] that

692
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,519
could go wrong I don't want anything to

693
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,080
go wrong for you but I want you to be

694
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,940
prepared for it because [ __ ] has gone

695
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,558
wrong for me and I wish that somebody

696
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,419
would have warned me the [ __ ] that I

697
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,279
could have gotten myself into so just

698
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,840
being a bro trying to help you out think

699
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,538
about it if it's not completely legal

700
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,158
where you are weigh your options legally

701
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:15,839
probably I should say don't [ __ ] do

702
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,400
it but you're a grown ass adult and I

703
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,599
recommend that every grown adult does

704
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,340
what the [ __ ] they want don't be

705
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,079
governed by a Rasta Jeff or the

706
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:24,418
government if that's how you feel all

707
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,639
right let me get myself back on on track

708
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,559
here uh integrated Pest Management plan

709
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,320
for every bug imaginable plan for every

710
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,418
pest animal uh problem pathogen

711
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,819
imaginable then also prepare for thieves

712
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:37,200
and prepare for law enforcement however

713
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:39,178
you want to deal with them is up to you

714
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,038
I should also say that booby traps are

715
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:42,960
highly illegal if you set up some sort

716
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,359
of booby traps in your grow in your yard

717
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,798
in your space and somebody else gets

718
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,779
hurt especially a law enforcement

719
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,339
officer you're in deep [ __ ] you're going

720
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:52,319
to get sued you're going to go to jail

721
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:54,119
if you own the property you're in extra

722
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,158
trouble if you're just a renter the

723
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,658
