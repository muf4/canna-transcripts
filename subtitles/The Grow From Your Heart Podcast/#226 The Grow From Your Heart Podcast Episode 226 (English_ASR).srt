00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,519
67 68 69 and 70 of the girl from Earhart

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,929
podcast if you're new to the show let me

8
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,550
explain what I'm doing a lot of

9
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:21,618
listeners have been asking for the old

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,830
episodes a lot of the old episodes have

11
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:26,660
really detailed grow lessons and there's

12
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:28,009
an episode where I schedule a perpetual

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,649
grow there's an episode where I talk

14
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,300
about drying and cheering buds a lot of

15
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:34,039
the good stuff is in the old episodes

16
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,599
when I first started and a lot of those

17
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,789
episodes have fallen out of the feed

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,000
iTunes and stitcher only holds 100

19
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,350
episodes this will be episode 226 so

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,210
that means there are a hundred and

21
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,920
twenty-six episodes that have fallen out

22
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,539
of iTunes I wanted to put them back

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,370
somehow but I figured that every time I

24
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,670
put in a new episode a new one falls

25
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:54,500
right out so I'm doing 3-hour chunks of

26
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,600
episodes 3 hours is about as long as my

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,130
recording software wants to handle 3

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,590
hours seems to be about the biggest file

29
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,600
you guys can download into your phones

30
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,340
without messing up your data plans so

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,829
I'm doing 3-hour chunks of old episodes

32
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,480
that puts usually 3 to 5 episodes in a

33
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:10,280
block that way you guys can hear the old

34
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,020
gems and then I can continue to put out

35
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,150
old stuff on Thursdays new stuff on

36
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:15,649
Mondays and everybody gets old content

37
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,280

38
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,680

192
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,149
to Denver that's a 125 miles it took me

193
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:55,668
close to two and a half hours just to

194
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:59,028
get to the south end of Denver I drove

195
00:06:55,668 --> 00:07:00,159
to garden of Weeden had a Airbnb spot

196
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:02,769

197
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,670

198
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:07,810
honestly I was in Louisville Colorado

199
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,310

200
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,509
house that they got there sweet score

201
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,819
but it's kind of far out of the way for

202
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:14,349
me anyway I drove out there I got dabbed

203
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,699
out with some of the crew from garden of

204
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,080
Weeden I wanted to meet up with those

205

guys hang out with them on a Friday

206
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,550

207
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:23,649
they've been busy as [ __ ] since then so

208
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,420
I hung out with the garden of Weeden

209
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:26,739

210
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,110
like I kind of hungry got kind of tired

211
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,939
so I headed back to the hotel my hotel

212
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,230
super cozy I was glad I got that room

213
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,490
that I got it was cheap so I was a

214
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,840
little questioning I was kind of

215
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,150
questioning on what how it was gonna be

216
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,500
as affordable and it was cozy it was a

217
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,870
great room for one guy that was a little

218
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,759
bed a couch a desk a TV I barely turned

219
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,889

220
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,360

228
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:05,500
get full already but there was one spot

229
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,300
I found it was open right away right

230
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,730
near the gate it cost me 30 bucks to

231
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,949
park about 30 feet from the gate that I

232
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,270
needed to use so I parked my car I got

233
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,519
myself organized they headed into the

234

241
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,879
together when I walked in I was just a

242
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,129
bunch of empty spaces with square booths

243
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,569
and a bunch of walkways on the people

244
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,279
were emptying everything out of boxes

245
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,529
and everyone was all frantic and moving

246
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,848
around I wasn't the smoke fest that you

247

249
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,200

packed and jumpin I got an early

251
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,379

252
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,060
people that I know there were it only

253
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:50,679
took me a few seconds to walk in and see

254
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:52,479
people that I know also I need to give a

255
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,949
big shout out to Robert and Anita I

256
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,330
don't know if they listened to the

257
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,770
podcast or not but I have some friends

258
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,150
that are local friends I bumped into so

259
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:03,519
there's a big-ass line outside the cup

260
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,840
right and there was a vendor entrance

261
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,909
and I just walked right in it nobody

262
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,100
asked me for any credentials I never

263
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:10,659
showed a wristband I never showed her an

264
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
idea never showed a ticket I walked

265
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,870
right in that son of a [ __ ]

266
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,310
where I passed everybody right into the

267
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,720
thing house in the cannabis cup at 9:00

268
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:20,109
a.m. while everybody else is waiting in

269
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,339
line and so uh I'm a kind guy had bumped

270
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,899
into Robert and Anita while I was in

271
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:24,220
line or while I was walking from the car

272
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,799
I saw them they were going to actually

273
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,060
use a porta potti and I thought well

274
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,078
should I saw my friends I should call

275
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:30,458
them and tell them about this so I

276
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:32,919
invited them to come join me and I met

277
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:34,719
them over by another area there's inside

278
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,708
the event and then they walked around

279
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,339
with me for a little while and hung out

280
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:40,568
so that was fun yeah so big shout out to

281
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,160
Robert and Anita for keeping me company

00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:43,689
for the first part of the morning there

283
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,490
that was kind of fun actually

284
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,779
I knew a lot of people there at the cup

285
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,159
and they kind of got annoyed that every

286
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:49,689
10 feet we would walk somebody would

287
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,159
bump into me and take a picture with us

288
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,569
and hang out them they wanted to go

289
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,469
cannabis cup so they ditched me what

290
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:54,490
should they didn't really teach me they

291
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,720
told me they were taking off which was

292
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,919
cool so Robert had fun left me wandering

293
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,660
around for myself for a little while I

294
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,479
bumped into so many people actually I

295
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:06,879
went to a booth I was looking to dab I

296
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,120
wanted a dad and I ran into Johnny be

297
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,620
from no goon on stick and he had a cool

298
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,179
booth and he said what's up and his crew

299
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,100
said hi to me in at the back of their

300
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:18,849
booth they shared a booth with some

301
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,439
other people and these fellers ah man I

302
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,579
feel like a dick right now because there

303
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:23,379

304
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:25,088
Fairley's very very similar

305
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:26,110

306
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,300
learned him by the end of the weekend

307
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,188

a brother with dreadlocks and there was

309
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:33,789

328
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,480
Cannabis Cup so this was how I walked

329
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:28,940
into the cup this is what I was

330
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:32,480
introduced with so I'm gonna take it all

331
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,070
right I took a nice chunky size dad

332
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,060
wasn't too ridiculous good and chunky

333
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,410
though there's a good dab

334
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:42,909
there's no cough so talk about the

335
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:45,740
flavor the flavor is very smooth it

336
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:49,419
doesn't taste like cheese to me or the

337
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,860
stream the cheese I get kind of uh

338
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:54,139
there's some sweetness to it there's a

339
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,340
little bit of funk to it you know the

340
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,990
cheese is setting it now that it's a

341
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,280
draw my tongue is kind of absorbing it a

342
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,710
little the cottonmouth thing is kicking

343
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:06,649

345
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:11,299
definitely the hint of the cheese in

346
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:12,829

more seed sales by walking around and I

406
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,700

reaction to the seeds and whatnot I

412
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,280
thought people would be more interested

413
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,800

414

the weather kept changing so we got cold

425
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,649
this is Saturday night so I headed back

426
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:53,659
to the hotel room to warm up get some

427
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,309
food I had some of that pizza that I had

428
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,469
left over from the night before that was

429
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:59,029
pretty big delicious I actually took a

430
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,370
couple fatty dabs and fell asleep for a

431
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:03,949
couple hours cuz I got a sunburn I was

432
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,929
up early but after that I woke up and I

433
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,370
headed to a private party there was a

434
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:12,559
private party outside the oriental

435
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:14,690
theater and so we weren't able to smoke

436
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,339
in the theatre I never even made it

437
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,170
inside the theater honestly it was loud

438
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,340
as [ __ ] and crowded but we weren't able

439
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:21,319
to smoke in there because the fire

440
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,870
department the police and the meed were

441
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,670
all doing random inspections on clubs

442
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,929
that weekend to see who was smoking cuz

443
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:28,549
they knew people are gonna be smoking in

444
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:31,069
clubs and it's illegal to smoke in

445
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:34,689
places so we weren't allowed to smoke in

446
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,640
there so we found a way around it and

447
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,720
I guess since the party's over excuse me

448
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,669
I'm burping I guess since the party's

449
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,769
over I could blow up the spot this is

450
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:44,439
how we did it outside the theater these

451
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:46,389
people Park to tour buses one of the

452
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,670
tour buses had a private party and since

453
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:50,230
the bus is private nobody can come in

454
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,579
and tell us that we can't smoke there if

455
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,960
the cops aren't even welcome on the bus

456
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,000
without a warrant or unless a crime

457
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,530
happens in there the fire department has

458
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,090
no damn reason and the meed is

459
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:01,839

00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,569
really respectful people mr. spliff of

489
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,759
cannabis has some our mr. spliff of now

490
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,500

491
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,529
some of my US beans now he'll be doing

492
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,088
that stuff I got late so I went back to

493
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:08,769
my hotel to gear up for gate day two

494
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:10,958
because this was only the first day of

495
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,400
the copy guys I get to meet up with a

496
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,500
lot of people I get to hang out tasks

497
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,329
Rock I don't want to list all the people

498
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,670
that I saw because I will forget more

499
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:20,349
people than I remember it was a huge

500
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,810
weekend and I got a sunburn

501
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:23,889
I got dabbed out and I recently had a

502
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,379
head injury and I feel like I don't

503
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:29,440
remember as much [ __ ] as I should but uh

504
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,300
for Sunday I slept in a little because

505
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,799
it wore myself out Saturday I definitely

506
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,980
was exhausted I slept in a little I

507
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,899
headed to the cup around lunchtime I got

508
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,250
smart Oh to the grocery store and got a

509
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,690
bunch of fruit and since I had the

510
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,519
vendor wristband I was able to take some

511
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,259
fruit and some healthy drinks into my

512
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,519
backpack with me and sneak those inside

513
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,940
didn't have a security thing to go

514
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,168
through

515
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,240
all the normal people had to go through

516
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:50,379
security I got the little VIP vendor

517
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,579
pass no I just got to walk right past

518
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:54,250
all that [ __ ] that was awesome

519
00:17:51,579 --> 00:18:01,480
so do that dab is working by the way

520
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:02,798
that she's definitely kicking in with me

521
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,599
so I had some food it took me about an

522
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,548
hour to park that day from the time I

523
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:08,408
got you know what before I got to the

524
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:11,740
58th Street exit traffic was already

525
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:13,090
backed up on the exit and it took me 15

526
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,069
minutes to get from the exit to the

527
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:17,109
parking areas and then I had to drive

528
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:19,599
around for another 20 or 30 to find a

529
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:24,008
parking spot and the parking cost me 20

530
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:25,418
or 30 bucks each day so I got into the

531
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:27,450
cup I wandered around and then

532
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:29,409
eventually I bumped into Jay again ah

533
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,940
her and I walked around the cup and

534
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,460
bumped into a bunch of friends until we

535
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,808
decided we needed some serious dabs at

536
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,220
the Cannabis Cup you think there's a lot

537
00:18:34,808 --> 00:18:38,048
of places to hang out and take some dabs

538
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,200
but there was really not a lot of comfy

539
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:42,759
places to just chill out and smoke there

540
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,669
are some VIP areas and [ __ ] but they

541
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,360
fill up quickly so my friend Jay and I

542
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:49,450
Julie

543
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,949
we found a loading dock area and we made

544
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,778
a little area for ourselves and got

545
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,220
comfy there and just dabbed out and took

546
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:56,558
a bunch of selfies and had a good time

547
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,149
for a few so sunday was a really fun day

548
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,740
it was more relaxing Saturday Saturday

549
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:01,148
was kind of crowded it's gonna hustle

550
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,138
and bustle II cuz everyone's trying to

551
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:03,428
meet up with all their friends it's like

552
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,839
the first day of school I haven't seen a

553
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:07,538
lot of those people in close to a year

554
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,500
if not a year so I was mostly pumping in

555
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:09,940
her friends and hanging out with Jay

556
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,450
until the evening when we headed to the

557
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:17,889
award ceremony let's see there's a

558
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,058
three-day event so I'm confused by that

559
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,500
I get [ __ ] up on that all the time

560
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,668
usually you do the awards at the last

561
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,619
day but they didn't which we'll talk

562
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:25,659
about something on that also so until

563
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:27,579
the awards ceremony the highlight of my

564
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:30,970
day was probably hanging out and eating

565
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:32,648
lunch with Addison de Moura the lines

566
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,950
were really long and all the food trucks

567
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:38,378
but there's one food truck that serves

568
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,940
organic gluten-free food and it's funny

569
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:42,459
because there's chicken legs hot dogs

570
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,840
burgers french fries all kinds of food

571
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,519
trucks right and then in the middle

572
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,470
there's this one little blue baby blue

573
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:51,069
food truck that sells salads for nine

574
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,048
bucks I got a salad with some chopped up

575
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:54,579
strawberries and some blueberries and

576
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:56,138
some fruit that I couldn't identify it

577
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:57,730
was delicious I mean it was good I just

578
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:58,839
don't know what the hell it was and then

579
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,849
in the bottom there were chunks

580
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,529
of feta and then every time I stirred it

581
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:03,969
I found another layer of goodness in

582
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:06,759
there but there was honey all over it

583
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,160
for dressing I was nine bucks but that

584
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:10,599
was like the most uh most edible stuff

585
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,490
I'm a vegetarian and I try to eat well

586
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:14,289
so I was the most edible stuff there so

587
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,759
that wine was to people long there's two

588
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:18,220
people in front of me and I had my food

589
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,019
in less than like five minutes Jay

590
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,779
wanted some food from another car and

591
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:24,849
she waited in line for the entire time

592
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:27,339
that I was in line plus the time that I

593
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,259
ate my food plus a little bit longer

594
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:31,480
some people walked by and saw me at a

595
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:33,039
table and I was sitting at a table where

596
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,480
four people could fit they saw me there

597
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,589
by myself know like hey dude can we eat

598
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,599
with you and as like well [ __ ] yeah you

599
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:39,579
got plenty of time and those people ate

600
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,619
their meals cleaned up after themselves

601
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:43,480
shook my hand said goodbye and took off

602
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:45,729
before Jay even got her food that's how

603
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,950
long some of the food lines were ah so

604
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,110
since I'm sitting by the organic food

605
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,600
truck eating my food my buddy Addison

606
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:54,339
tomorrow walked up and sat down and

607
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,569
ordered food at the food truck and then

608
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:57,609
after that he came and sat down with me

609
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:59,079
and I think having lunch with that he

610
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:01,379
might have been my highlight of my

611
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,609
afternoon up until the award ceremony

612
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,020
Addison is a busy man and it seems like

613
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:07,119
everybody at the Cannabis Cup knew him

614
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:08,799
so getting an hour out of his life for

615
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,959
him to just sit down and hang out not

616
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,240
talk business to just be my bro for an

617
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,680
hour and hang out ketchup was really an

618
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,569
honor so shout out to Addison I hope you

619
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,250
get to hear this bro so after a bunch of

620
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:20,139
dabs with Addison and dab so hard and

621
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,730
Julie joined us at the table we made

622
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,080
another friend at the table too I cannot

623
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,960
remember her name her name might have

624
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:27,759
been Elise yeah was her name was Elise

625
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,319
she was a medical cannabis user and she

626
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,700
uses cannabis for several reasons and

627
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,980
she was just waiting for her friend and

628
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,600
lion also so she sat down and ate with

629
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,009
me and said she ate with me when she was

630
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,599
done I gave her some dabs just like the

631
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:43,690
rest of the truth she really appreciated

632
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:45,189
it I misjudged that lady she was I don't

633
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,590
even want to guess how old she was older

634
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,299
than me and she seemed all nice and kind

635
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,769
but she took a dad like a [ __ ]

636
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:51,359
champion I should have given her larger

637
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,309
dabs

638
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,539
it's pretty funny so after the a bunch

639
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:58,059
of dabs and she was time for the award

640
00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:02,230
ceremony the award ceremony was really

641
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:03,460
neat it's kind of like the first award

642
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,720
they made a mistake they announced the

643
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,950
third place is the first place in the

644
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,960
first place is the third place and it

645
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,920
was always already chaos but that's how

646
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,440
High Times likes to do [ __ ]

647
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,279
so they finally got their [ __ ] together

648
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,450
Vader won the first three awards we'll

649
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,859
talk about that in a minute but one

650
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,450
thing that really stood out to me was

651
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:22,669
when High Times brought out two members

652
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:26,660
of the Jamaican ganja Farmers

653
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:28,340
Association one guy was he had short

654
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,009
hair and wore a jacket and then the

655
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:34,789
other guy was taller and had dreadlocks

656
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:37,759
to his ass and he was the representative

657
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:39,740
of the Rasta community and these guys

658
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,950
spoke about legalization in Jamaica and

659
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,960
they announced that the high times would

660
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,470
be hosting a cannabis cup on the island

661
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,390
of Jamaica in November so I'm thinking

662
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,890
about going but honestly I don't know if

663
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,610
I want to travel to Jamaica for a

664
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:59,030
cannabis cup it might not be the most

665
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:59,539
financially sound idea but I'll think

666
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:01,240
about it

667
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:03,230
in a lot of things I'm thinking about

668
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,700
one thing I thought was funny when the

669
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,870
Jamaican came out the Jamaican guy the

670
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:10,519
Rasta started speaking he said greetings

671
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:12,439
in the name of the Most High his

672
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,779
Imperial Majesty King Haile Selassie I

673
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,720
had the first jaw and all of the Rastas

674
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:19,129
in the room yield Rastafari and a guy

675
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,870
behind me bumped his buddy on the

676
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:24,020
shoulder and said what did he just say

677
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:26,209
and I jokingly turned back and politely

678
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:27,769
said he said hello I thought it was

679
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,390
pretty funny because the dude behind me

680
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:32,298
had no idea what this little Rasta man

681
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:34,100
just said so I was really excited to see

682
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:35,990
a Rasta man come out it's a cannabis cup

683
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:37,849
and tell me that there's gonna be a

684
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,109
cannabis cup in Jamaica in November that

685
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,308
was kind of neat just to see some true

686
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:42,139
Rastas come on get to celebrate

687
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:45,950
Rastafari at the Cannabis Cup was nice

688
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:48,500

extract category I'm proud of [ __ ] for

699
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,859
my crew to tell you the truth I had that

700
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,620
head wound right I didn't feel good for

701
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:20,149
a few days and I went to spence's to go

702
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:22,489
kick back just to get away and he had

703
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,259
just made the cup entry and he's like

704
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,319
try this dog

705
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:28,809
my CBD entry and I hid it and it tasted

706
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,089
like I just bit into oranges it tastes

707
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,529
like I had a mouthful of delicious sweet

708
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:34,619
oranges but I'm drooling now and I kind

709
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:37,839
of want an orange because of this but

710
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:40,029
and I blew it out and I had had a

711
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,289
concussion and it felt like I had a belt

712
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:42,759
tied around my head I feel like just

713
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:45,279
pressure around my head when I blew out

714
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:47,230
this dab it felt like you undid the belt

715
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,789
a couple of notches and he gave me a

716
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,589
couple of more tabs and I looked at him

717
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,450
and I was like bro I am the most

718
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,309
comfortable right now that I have been

719
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,019
in several days because I was in pain

720
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:58,539
and my head hurt and I wasn't feeling

721
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:01,240
right then those dabs like sent me right

722
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:03,670
dude and he told me he said you look

723
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,559
like you're the best you've been in a

724
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,180
few days like I guess people could

725
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:08,980
physically see that I didn't feel good I

726
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,310

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,690
care givers if you have to go to a

975
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:21,628
dispensary for CBD medicine

976
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,070
I either recommend the green and healthy

977
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:24,539
well are green and healthy cannabis or

978
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,159
natural mystic cannabis caregivers

979
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:27,809
there's the only two spots that syndra -

980
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,340
they're both medical shops those are the

981
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:31,679
only places to go - we talked about the

982
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,800
third place that is industrial hemp CBD

983
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,039
extract so then we move on to best CBD

984
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,450
edible I had the honor of meeting the

985
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:43,980
guy from foxtrax

986
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:45,949
Fox extracts this dude made a 160

987
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:49,019
milligrams banana pudding bar in

988
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:51,089
collaboration with shoe melt and it won

989
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:53,550
first place in the best CBD edible and

990
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:55,169
dude I eat three squares of that thing

991
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,269

992
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:58,529

00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:00,599
that's twenty forty sixty eight sixty

994
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,548

995
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,960

996
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:06,420

of the afternoon

999
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:12,150
maybe that's why Saturday was so mellow

1000
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:14,219
for me so the second place was rocky CBD

1001

1068
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:47,849
let's talk about something that I found

1069
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,670
kind of disrespectful at the Cannabis

1070
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:52,980
Cup a company called Vader won several

1071
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,050
awards they won the first three awards

1072
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,690
that were given away at the cup they had

1073
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,130
a huge set up at the they had a place

1074
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,530
called invader village in the cannabis

1075
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,180
cup is a huge setup with a stage they

1076
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,010
had live musical acts they had semi

1077
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:06,809
famous celebrities at the booths all day

1078
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,220
my friend had a bill was they're

1079
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:10,289
launching prizes into the crowd he had

1080
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:12,839
the t-shirt gun the t-shirt cannon he

1081
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:16,679
would fill it up with packages of

1082
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,390
shatter and launch and joints and bags

1083
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:20,219

1084
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:22,619
shatter and joints into the crowd of

1085
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:24,059
people people would go nuts and get it

1086
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,859
so they win best booth they want all

1087
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:27,449

1088

1095

1096
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,780
up at night while everyone was asleep

1097
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:51,179
and they took off Monday before the

1098
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,920
couple open at noon and that just seems

1099
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:54,239
disrespectful to me like if you're gonna

1100
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,159
come to a competition if you're gonna

1101
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,989
come to an event and you're gonna build

1102
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,420
a big-ass stage and make a big spectacle

1103
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:01,979
then you win hang out for the last day

1104
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,750
and play with all the cool kids don't be

1105
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,619
a dick and leave I just found that

1106
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:10,409
disrespectful that's not even my event

1107
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:11,940
whatever I found that rude so congrats

1108
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:14,429
on all your wins Vader but that was not

1109
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,750
a classy move to do that um so let's

1110
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:16,469
move on a little bit this leads me into

1111
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,389
Monday

1112
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:20,659

1114
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:25,549
the weather had been sketchy all weekend

1115
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,889
so at some points I was wearing a

1116
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,510
t-shirt and I was sweating and then

1117
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:32,719
other times I was had a hoodie on with

1118
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:35,720
my hood up and I was freezing so the

1119
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,369
weather was super sketchy Monday had a

1120
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,569
nice break in the weather so it felt

1121
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:40,250
like everybody showed up for the last

1122
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,750

1125
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,730
crazy but I got there around lunchtime I

1126
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,309

1127

1211
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:56,980
sometimes it pays to be Rasta Jeff and

1212
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,420
have a little podcast because while I

1213
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,490
was at the Cannabis Cup somebody walked

1214
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,139
up to me and this happened two days in a

1215
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:04,209
row he walked up to me and he handed me

1216
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:07,059
these little packages and it says

1217
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:15,490
electrum extracts I'm just gonna pull

1218
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:17,409
this hard to read so I can see it it

1219
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:18,669
says electrum extracts and you unfold it

1220
00:43:17,409 --> 00:43:20,649
on the other side it says lemon

1221
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:23,320
sometimes banana cush contains 100%

1222
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:25,269
organic cannabis whole plant extracted

1223
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,400

1224

nice amber e color to it let's see I'm

1288

smelling it off the parchment

00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:18,909
we're out of this so we're gonna take a

1293
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:22,900
DAB once again guys join me hope you got

1294
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:25,599
a DAB this is the sativa blend cannabis

1295
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,309
this is whole plant extract it via so a

1296
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,110
whole plant does that mean that you just

1297
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:31,869
Chuck the cut the buds off the sticks

1298
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:34,059
and do like fan leaves and nugs all at

1299
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:35,619
once I've done that at school it comes

1300
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:36,849
out great I like to do that with my CBD

1301
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:39,069
medicine so you get that full spectrum

1302
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:42,489
just curious with that a whole plant

1303
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:52,870
they're hinting out there all right guys

1304
00:46:42,489 --> 00:47:00,909
here we go that lime flavor catches me

1305
00:46:52,869 --> 00:47:04,150
but this one's good oh it's the team of

1306
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:08,889
two cuz my head is just like that I love

1307
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:11,079
that feeling yeah okay definitely both

1308
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:14,319
of those were smooth both of them had a

1309
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,909
nice texture both more well done there's

1310
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,890
too much of a lime flavor on this rare

1311
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:20,170
dankness one for me but it's just a

1312
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:22,960
personal thing but overall that's a

1313
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,490
great hash both of these are great the

1314
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,990
only the only reason I don't give this

1315
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:28,929
one a perfect 10 is cuz the wine thing

1316
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:30,879
is not my flavor the orange flavored one

1317
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,699
or the lemon flavoured one wins so I do

1318
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,490
give you a thumbs up on both of these

1319
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:40,899

01:03:14,088 --> 01:03:18,858
in Los Angeles and he told me that there

1730
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,509
is a big room where you can set up and

1731
01:03:18,858 --> 01:03:23,179
everybody records their podcast out

1732
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:25,099
there and he said that if I come he

1733
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:28,369
would be on my show and he shook my hand

1734
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:30,140
so if I make it to LA pod fast pod fest

1735

1736
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:34,458
podcast that would be [ __ ] cool he

1737
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:36,048
was he was a really nice guy I know that

1738
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:38,178
I can't keep it in check tonight I've

1739
01:03:36,048 --> 01:03:41,170
said the f-bomb probably 15 times

1740
01:03:38,179 --> 01:03:41,170
already yeah

1741
01:03:45,509 --> 01:03:51,190
but but Graham amazed me because he was

1742
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:54,400
funny and he was clean which is hard to

1743
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:56,440
do so like just more props to him he was

1744
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,599
really funny if he would ever listen to

1745
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,088
this I hope he would hear us say that uh

1746
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:03,249
he was the best part of that night

1747
01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:06,518
because Doug Benson came on after him

1748
01:04:03,248 --> 01:04:08,889
and Doug first thing he said he goes uh

1749
01:04:06,518 --> 01:04:11,469
I woke up this morning I started smoking

1750
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:12,578
this was on 4/20 yeah this was on 4/20

1751
01:04:11,469 --> 01:04:15,098
so let's yeah let's remind the people

1752
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:18,818
that yeah so he woke up he started

1753
01:04:15,099 --> 01:04:21,519
smoking he did a 420 show up til he was

1754
01:04:18,818 --> 01:04:23,739
he was smoking up until then he just

1755
01:04:21,518 --> 01:04:26,379
kept smoking all day and that was the

1756
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:27,998
first thing he said is like he did all

1757
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:30,278
he could do to make it to where he

1758
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:32,498
couldn't make it to that last show his

1759
01:04:30,278 --> 01:04:34,778
goal was to be too high to record that

1760
01:04:32,498 --> 01:04:36,489
show I think he succeeded you know I've

1761
01:04:34,778 --> 01:04:38,768
seen I've gotten Doug Benson high

1762
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:41,858
several times and I've never seen him

1763
01:04:38,768 --> 01:04:44,528
that high I got high like bragging but

1764
01:04:41,858 --> 01:04:46,028
I'm kind of not bros with internet

1765
01:04:44,528 --> 01:04:48,670

1766
01:04:46,028 --> 01:04:50,079
we're talking [ __ ] some of the comedians

1767
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:52,119
know who I am by now because I've gone

1768
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,410
to enough shows so he'd relies on Ross

1769
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:54,730
did you have to get him high before the

1770
01:04:53,409 --> 01:04:56,920
show he knows I've got some dank weed

1771
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:58,389
and I'm not psycho so he hits me up he

1772
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,039
hit me up to get him high what time I

1773
01:04:58,389 --> 01:05:01,690
got him high and he told me from the

1774
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:03,690
stage he [ __ ] up a joke and looked at

1775
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:06,278
me and said you got me too I bro yeah

1776
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:08,950
that night he was three or four times

1777
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:11,858
beyond that level of Highness he was he

1778
01:05:08,949 --> 01:05:14,409
was so [ __ ] skinny I'd [ __ ] you

1779
01:05:11,858 --> 01:05:16,989
could not see when I was anyone I was

1780
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:19,778
always I think what I was working kind

1781
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:24,420
of but it was it was [ __ ] I don't

1782
01:05:19,778 --> 01:05:27,759
know dude he was so baked that he just

1783
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:29,170
he it just wasn't even that much fun he

1784
01:05:27,759 --> 01:05:31,210
kept putting his head on the microphone

1785
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:32,588
you guys heard this sound a lot and that

1786
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,940
was his head hitting the microphone so

1787
01:05:32,588 --> 01:05:35,710
that he could take a little break he was

1788
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:37,599
I mean he was laughing at his own jokes

1789
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,369
and there was some really hilarious [ __ ]

1790
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,410
that he said he spent 30 minutes reading

1791
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:42,910
[ __ ] tweets thank you the first 30

1792
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:45,548
minutes of his show he read tweets which

1793
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:47,379
he what the problem was that 30 minutes

1794
01:05:45,548 --> 01:05:49,420
was only divided up by like five tweets

1795
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:51,599
yes it wasn't like a whole bunch of

1796
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:53,739
tweets it was like five people that were

1797
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,360
audacious enough to pull their phone out

1798
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:58,119
in a comedy show

1799
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:00,190
and send him a shout or and tweet it

1800
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:03,609
right then yeah that's we're up front

1801
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:05,200
row I can't do that grandma started me

1802
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,610
because my phone was on my lap because

1803
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,279
it's too big for my pocket I got this

1804
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:11,050
iPhone six-plus my lap and gram kept

1805
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,460
looking at it I felt like grandma would

1806
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,460
looked at my phone twice like he's got

1807
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:17,789
[Music]

1808
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:32,079
grandma's checking it out literally on

1809
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:35,230
he had to move the mic from his face and

1810
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:38,259
yaw on stage performing his comedy

1811
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:40,119
special so he actually said ah this is

1812
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,770
my third time recording this and what I

1813
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:43,539
want to do is make sure to get the jokes

1814
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:45,940
that I didn't get perfect the last

1815
01:06:43,539 --> 01:06:47,800
couple of times no now don't don't let

1816
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:50,139
me say anything other than I respect him

1817
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,110
for being honest but I just didn't pay

1818
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:54,819
to go see a guy just kind of muddle

1819
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,860
through something right do you know what

1820
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,090
I mean yeah when I go to see a concert I

1821
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:02,019
don't want to watch Metallica do

1822
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:07,269
soundcheck five times that would be well

1823
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:09,400
I mean maybe I don't want to watch him

1824
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:13,150
try to do some song they haven't done

1825
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:15,880
right in a couple of weeks properly

1826
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:18,639
we're gonna try it yeah three times yeah

1827
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:20,559
I mean things I guess he did things

1828
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,629
three times that day though he did a

1829
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,610
couple of the bits twice because he

1830
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:26,980
forgot he did one when he was doing a

1831
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:28,599
bit fo yeah well it's because he broke

1832
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,730
it off early in the first part he didn't

1833
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:33,369
tell like the same part of the story

1834
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:36,550
dude I don't remember how high were we

1835
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:39,190
part of that was because he had a pocket

1836
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:42,220
full of notes if it worked disheveled it

1837
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:44,139
looked like it looks like your grandpa

1838
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:45,489
had gone to Lowe's you know when grandpa

1839
01:07:44,139 --> 01:07:47,409
comes home from going out all day he's

1840
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:49,419
got a pocketful of receipts and a couple

1841
01:07:47,409 --> 01:07:56,589
of breath mints and a [ __ ] toothpick

1842
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:58,599
and like well he had there's like four

1843
01:07:56,590 --> 01:08:00,640
or five different colors of pieces of

1844
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:02,170
paper in there there was a receipt for

1845
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,179
Barnes and Noble in there that I could

1846
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:06,340
see like I don't know if he had

1847
01:08:04,179 --> 01:08:07,848
scribbled on all of it but that's what

1848
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:12,259
that's where his notes were

1849
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:42,859
in that handful of grandpa is also the

1850
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:47,868
name of my new metal band made it this

1851
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:49,460
far into this podcast we salute you you

1852
01:08:47,868 --> 01:09:09,559
know we're probably not gonna be talking

1853
01:08:49,460 --> 01:09:10,880
too much about growing you could put

1854
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:21,560
your notebook away there will be nothing

1855
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:23,480
to write down notes right and then

1856
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:27,909
that's where we were there yeah and then

1857
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:30,408
he just and I think he needs glasses a

1858
01:09:27,908 --> 01:09:34,189
little bit because they were [ __ ]

1859
01:09:30,408 --> 01:09:37,929
closed locked up somebody threw a joint

1860
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:37,928
on stage and it took him two minutes to

1861
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:42,469
was waiting and if you've ever seen the

1862
01:09:40,368 --> 01:09:44,118
comedy works like stage it's well lit

1863
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:49,279
and it's maybe the size of your kitchen

1864
01:09:44,118 --> 01:09:51,198
table yes it's not a big thing there was

1865
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,119
nothing on the stage it's like a blue

1866
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:56,299
carpet what did somebody say the floor

1867
01:09:53,118 --> 01:10:02,569
looked like somebody tweeted oh yeah or

1868
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:04,760
a salon floor vacuumed beautifully it

1869
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:06,829
was perfect anyway no but it was just

1870
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,349
like 30 minutes on five tweets which was

1871
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:11,118
kind of boring got into some other stuff

1872
01:10:09,349 --> 01:10:13,340
and then he tried to do like other

1873
01:10:11,118 --> 01:10:15,710
tweets or something like later in the

1874
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:19,029
show didn't he wasn't he doing tweet

1875
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:20,920
relief oh yeah he did a thing it's

1876
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:22,149
watch this knot that is a game that he

1877
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,158
plays on a show where he lets the

1878
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:26,679
audience members select movies and then

1879
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:28,118
he decides which one to watch but he was

1880
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:32,649
too high to keep track of what the other

1881
01:10:28,118 --> 01:10:35,308
audience members were saying it was the

1882
01:10:32,649 --> 01:10:38,348
things called promotional tool and I

1883
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:42,099
mean we we definitely felt like we got

1884
01:10:38,349 --> 01:10:44,770
used like a tool yeah it did it felt a

1885
01:10:42,099 --> 01:10:46,179
little like like you know what guys it

1886
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:47,530
sucks to be you but this is what's

1887
01:10:46,179 --> 01:10:56,050
happening and maybe that's the way it

1888
01:10:47,529 --> 01:10:57,698
has to be I didn't want to be like that

1889
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,119
was kind of [ __ ] whack for my twenty

1890
01:10:57,698 --> 01:11:00,428
bucks

1891
01:10:58,118 --> 01:11:02,828
well you went and hung out with Doug and

1892
01:11:00,429 --> 01:11:05,139
then me and my boy drew took off

1893
01:11:02,828 --> 01:11:06,368
yeah we were all stupidly enough there

1894
01:11:05,139 --> 01:11:08,260
were three car loads of people from

1895
01:11:06,368 --> 01:11:09,819
Pueblo with one or two people in each

1896
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:11,199
car because we didn't plan I had come

1897
01:11:09,819 --> 01:11:12,578
from the cannabis cup you came up on

1898
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:14,948
your own and then I invited Danielle

1899
01:11:12,578 --> 01:11:16,599
right after you left I was already in

1900
01:11:14,948 --> 01:11:18,368
monument by the time she had me up yeah

1901
01:11:16,599 --> 01:11:20,050
well she made it so I'm proud of her

1902
01:11:18,368 --> 01:11:21,939
super proud she made that but yes we all

1903
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:23,320
had to get in separate cars so once we

1904
01:11:21,939 --> 01:11:25,178
linked up and talked about it it was

1905
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:28,019
like yeah I felt like we kind of were

1906
01:11:25,179 --> 01:11:28,020
his guinea pigs

1907
01:11:28,408 --> 01:11:32,979
he saved the [ __ ] show Doug I'm not

1908
01:11:31,658 --> 01:11:34,388
being disrespectful to you but I just

1909
01:11:32,979 --> 01:11:37,808
feel like that third show man you were

1910
01:11:34,389 --> 01:11:39,429
too high and if I wasn't unlike a loyal

1911
01:11:37,809 --> 01:11:41,139
Doug fan so it's kind of neat for me to

1912
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:42,399
see that like I've seen enough Doug

1913
01:11:41,139 --> 01:11:44,380
that's why I'm watching my friend do

1914
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,750
comedy now whatever and I feel AP seats

1915
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:49,118
and [ __ ] but if I was a normal civilian

1916
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:51,099
listener I might not have been impressed

1917
01:11:49,118 --> 01:11:52,839
with that show well like I told you the

1918
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:54,760
only interaction I've had with them is

1919
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,989
just listening to Doug loves movies yeah

1920
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,760
and so that's not a whole lot of Doug

1921
01:11:55,988 --> 01:11:59,589
that's a lot of everybody else right I

1922
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,690
haven't watched Doug specials before

1923
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:04,449
that was my first chance of seeing Doug

1924
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:05,888
Benson and I was not impressed I've said

1925
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:08,859
it on the podcast before that I think

1926
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:10,690
maybe Doug's excessive cannabis use may

1927
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:12,988
be slowing down his comedy and his

1928
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:16,029
career and I think that our experience

1929
01:12:12,988 --> 01:12:17,589
solidifies my theory yeah yeah and that

1930
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:19,538
sucks because cannabis shouldn't be used

1931
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:21,038
as a slowing down it should be used as a

1932
01:12:19,538 --> 01:12:24,158
way to move yourself forward

1933
01:12:21,038 --> 01:12:26,469
well then real quick and then we didn't

1934
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:27,879
bring this up before but when when there

1935
01:12:26,469 --> 01:12:29,109
was that he said we're all gonna go

1936
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,449
smoke outside and I was like alright

1937
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:31,489
cool

1938
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:33,409
so we'll go smoke there was what like a

1939
01:12:31,489 --> 01:12:34,789
hundred people people I was like a

1940
01:12:33,409 --> 01:12:36,170
hundred people in that alleyway I don't

1941
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:37,729
know if you guys have ever seen that

1942
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:38,840
economy works alleyway but it's probably

1943
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:42,409
30 feet wide

1944
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:44,810
yeah well I'm just trying to give it a

1945
01:12:42,409 --> 01:12:52,340
little bit of practice and a person on

1946
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:54,410
either side of the car yeah I guess all

1947
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,360
right so so we'll say ten feet wide

1948
01:12:54,409 --> 01:12:57,979
maybe fifteen but there was there was

1949
01:12:56,359 --> 01:13:01,339
like 75 to honor people are a lot of

1950
01:12:57,979 --> 01:13:04,189
people in there um and and it started

1951
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:05,750
feeling real bro II well while Doug was

1952
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:08,299
smoking Doug could take a hit of a joint

1953
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:10,699
and everybody would cheer for it yeah as

1954
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:12,619
though he was like some hero like coming

1955
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:16,399
home from war and this was his first

1956
01:13:12,619 --> 01:13:18,979
like step on American soil it was [ __ ]

1957
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:21,319
it was just like yeah that's that's it

1958
01:13:18,979 --> 01:13:22,939
like we're doing it we're outside didn't

1959
01:13:21,319 --> 01:13:25,819
call it Rado doing it it was just like

1960
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:27,859
no this is this isn't the attitude I

1961
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:29,420
want to have around weed yeah yeah it

1962
01:13:27,859 --> 01:13:30,949
kind of wasn't it seemed like we were

1963
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:34,340
taking tequila shots and everybody was

1964
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:36,439
high-fiving shots yeah yeah that's how I

1965
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:38,180
felt about it I'm glad that I didn't I

1966
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:38,839
didn't stick around I have to get home I

1967
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,520
was dying

1968
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,529
actually Doug usually hangs out and

1969
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,670
smokes with everybody but he uh he

1970
01:13:42,529 --> 01:13:45,229
smoked with a few people and then he

1971
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:47,060
knows me so he actually turned to me and

1972
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:48,439
he said hey Ross - Jeff how are you man

1973

1976
01:13:52,609 --> 01:13:55,579

01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:31,430
industry for a long time but I finally

1994

1997
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:40,630

1999

2025
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:41,079
check that one out it may lose some of

2026
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:43,000
you guys some you guys may like it Clint

2027
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:45,729
I could tell that it was a little bit

2028
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:49,270
lost during the show yeah it was either

2029
01:15:45,729 --> 01:15:51,279
lost or it was just I don't know he gets

2030
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:53,110
a little ratty you know how it is yeah

2031
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:56,349
he calls that the boring preachy part of

2032
01:15:53,109 --> 01:15:58,329
his show that's a good portion of his

2033
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:00,160
show apparently because uh there was a

2034
01:15:58,329 --> 01:16:01,510
lot of preachy parts there was some joke

2035
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,859
parts at the start they just take a

2036
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:05,110
little while he's got like a lot of

2037
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:06,939
references and stuff that just it just

2038
01:16:05,109 --> 01:16:08,469
takes a while to get to things I'm more

2039
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:11,229
of a you know let me hit you with the

2040
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:13,360
left and a right black his comedy he's

2041
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:14,739
doing he's a smart guy and I like the

2042
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:16,269
guy and he's funny like some of the

2043
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:17,679
jokes he had were really funny it just

2044
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:19,810
takes a little while to get there but

2045
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:23,079
he's I'm pretty sure he's like improving

2046
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:24,760
all of that all of that Wednesday was

2047
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,769
the podcast Thursday Friday and Saturday

2048
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,420
he's doing stand-up which will be

2049
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:30,340
completely different than what you saw

2050
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:31,720
that's the thing is like improv is a

2051
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:34,900
different thing to me you know what I

2052
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:36,909
mean like I do stand-up I don't do

2053
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:39,369
improv and it's nothing against improv I

2054
01:16:36,909 --> 01:16:41,649
just don't do it so I don't know those

2055
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:44,079
skills like those guys are better at

2056
01:16:41,649 --> 01:16:45,519
many many things but I think just

2057
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,309
getting to the joke and keeping people

2058
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,050
laughing that's where stand-up reigns

2059
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,670
right

2060
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:53,579
keeping you engaged and stuff like that

2061
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:55,230
now improv is kind of like well let's

2062
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:57,420
try to figure out how do we get back to

2063
01:16:55,229 --> 01:16:58,919
this like neutral points or whatever so

2064
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:01,079
that way we can make it funny in here

2065
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,880
but those guys that's a challenge and a

2066
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:05,579
half what the audience is a little bit

2067
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,050
more gives you more leeway with that oh

2068
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:09,090
yeah you know what I mean so maybe you

2069
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:11,940
guys know in the podcast were giving him

2070
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:13,860
more leeway than I was well I'm not

2071
01:17:11,939 --> 01:17:16,349
they're just for the funny I'm expecting

2072
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:18,719
to be enlightened a little by Greg

2073
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:21,510
educated slightly offended at some

2074
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:23,400
points I know he's the thinking man's

2075
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:24,720
comedian he you have to den he calls

2076
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:27,029
himself the world's smartest man it's

2077
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:29,550
not it's that's a joke that's just a but

2078
01:17:27,029 --> 01:17:31,229
it's smart dude he's a smart sucker and

2079
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:32,789
he's been doing improv we you asked him

2080
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:34,199
how long you've been doing comedy and he

2081
01:17:32,789 --> 01:17:35,789

2088
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:49,829
mine to be you and he kind of did kind

2089
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:51,719
of just dismiss me as though I was

2090
01:17:49,829 --> 01:17:54,329
saying like an [ __ ] but what I meant

2091
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:56,520
like was all respect like if you'd like

2092
01:17:54,329 --> 01:17:58,409
I just I just want to know that there is

2093
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,570
the possibility that in like you've been

2094
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:02,130
doing this for 30 years that's what it

2095
01:18:00,569 --> 01:18:04,319
takes to get to you cool man

2096
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:06,090

01:18:06,899 --> 01:18:13,649
his name is show right whose line is it

2100
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:15,090
anyway he's uh no offense to Greg but

2101
01:18:13,649 --> 01:18:17,429
he's probably the one that you call the

2102
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:18,930
gay one yeah he's not he's got a

2103
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:20,520
beautiful wife named Jennifer and he is

2104
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:29,280
completely straight and he stands up for

2105
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:36,330
women's rights it's just like I probably

2106
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:38,639
wouldn't want to marry that guy nothing

2107
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:41,220
else about that situation he wears a

2108
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:44,400
suit all of the time he had a suit with

2109
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:46,140
an kind of it it's a blueish jacket with

2110

2111
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:50,250
had a purple hankie in one pocket and at

2112
01:18:48,569 --> 01:18:52,559
one point he pulled out a hankie out of

2113
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:55,020
his jacket pocket to do a joke and the

2114
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,360
hankie out of his pocket was perfectly

2115
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:59,850
pressed and it was purple and it had

2116

head-to-toe his shoes were sharp the

2120
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:10,420
only thing that shocked me about the man

2121
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:11,920
was uh so we saw the comp we saw him

2122

2124
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:16,510

2128
01:19:21,699 --> 01:19:25,300

2129
01:19:24,069 --> 01:19:26,590

2133
01:19:30,789 --> 01:19:33,939

2135
01:19:33,939 --> 01:19:38,229
Proops fan so uh I looked over in

2136
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:39,909
Gregg's kind of far Clint's gonna fall

2137
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:41,649
into sleep a couple of times and then

2138
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:42,970
after the show we're looking for the

2139
01:19:41,649 --> 01:19:44,109
guys and we can't find him and a friend

2140
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:45,909
of mine is like dude they're down here

2141
01:19:44,109 --> 01:19:47,529
in this area smokin just walk back there

2142
01:19:45,909 --> 01:19:49,059
and I walk back there and I could hear a

2143
01:19:47,529 --> 01:19:51,099
guy from a block away he's got a very

2144
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:52,270
recognizable voice so we walk down the

2145
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,210
stairs and they're just hanging out

2146
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:57,130
smoking so and guy who greets me and

2147
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:58,960
knew my name and then I introduced

2148
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,890
myself to Greg Proops he sticks out his

2149
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,329
hand we shake hands

2150
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:04,329
I asked if we're interrupting they said

2151
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:06,909
no I lit a joint that's just what I felt

2152
01:20:04,329 --> 01:20:12,880
like needed to happen hanging out with

2153
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:15,760
these guys was the thing that shocked me

2154
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,560
about Greg he smokes cigarettes I never

2155
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,060
would have guessed Greg Proops smokes

2156
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,140
cigarettes I don't know why he would

2157
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:21,460
have thought that he was smarter than

2158
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:23,680
that is that what you're saying I think

2159
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:25,480
so yes nothing against you cigarette

2160
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:30,119
smokers I know because I have just

2161
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:33,369

2163
01:20:33,369 --> 01:20:38,590

2164
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:39,880
thing well it's better for me but it

2165
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:43,930
could also get me fired from a job oh

2166
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:47,498
yeah Clint this is bobby mcgee here

2167

2170
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:58,089

2172
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:02,230
too that's kind of it was so weird that

2173
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:04,059
like I smell his cigarette worse than I

2174
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:05,859
could smell all the dank around us

2175
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:08,460
Shantanu and guy oh he pulled out some

2176
01:21:05,859 --> 01:21:10,589
tangi from cali doing it

2177
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:12,210
steak and some flavor to it that tangi

2178
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:14,219
was delicious I think it's a chance to

2179
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:15,899
try ice melt it I was already too high

2180
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:17,730
by the time he had pulled that out ice

2181
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:20,819
melts it though I think my plant emoji

2182
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:22,468
trumped it the Platinum OD was I gave

2183
01:21:20,819 --> 01:21:23,519
him the last of my platinum og that I

2184
01:21:22,469 --> 01:21:26,219
had with me and he looked quite

2185
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:28,380
impressed with it he was he was a nice

2186
01:21:26,219 --> 01:21:29,939
guy too so and guy was a great dude that

2187
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:32,190
is true we smoked with these guys for

2188
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:34,919
like an hour and they were talking to us

2189
01:21:32,189 --> 01:21:36,269
not at us not about us like we were just

2190
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,039
hanging out with normal people

2191
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:39,690
at one point Greg Proops was telling a

2192
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:40,800
baseball story go figure

2193
01:21:39,689 --> 01:21:43,079
if you know anything about proofs you

2194
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,619
know he's a huge baseball fan and he was

2195
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:49,409
talking about a player leading off of

2196
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:52,079
first blade base in a celebration and in

2197
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:53,909
the umpire yelled play ball and the guy

2198
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:55,769
just stayed way off of first blade base

2199
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:58,409
and so the first baseman reaches over

2200
01:21:55,770 --> 01:22:00,930
with the ball and tags him out and as he

2201
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:03,779
talks about tagging about he damn near

2202
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:06,000
punched me in the tape because he tagged

2203
01:22:03,779 --> 01:22:09,420
me out as like a physical act to show

2204
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,539
what happened he was being cool story

2205
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:15,000
was the Kansas City Royals own George

2206
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:16,469
Brett for all the stoner [ __ ]

2207
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,140
baseball that was the story you were

2208
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:20,600
that we were being told 5,000 light up

2209
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,950
on you - yeah yeah that's exactly

2210
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:25,170
celebrating his 3,000 tip but so when

2211
01:22:22,949 --> 01:22:28,529
Proops was acting out the smack he

2212
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:30,270
smacked me his buddy and I tried not to

2213
01:22:28,529 --> 01:22:31,769
light up like a schoolgirl because I was

2214
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:32,460
stupid excited but I thought I was

2215
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:35,130
pretty awesome

2216
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:37,590

2217
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:40,079
nerd and he's a comedy legend and I'm a

2218
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:44,090
podcaster and he's got a great podcast

2219
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:46,829
so something about Enys articulate and

2220
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:48,779
he makes me speak and write better it

2221
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:51,149
actually makes me more conscious of my

2222
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:53,849
my vocabulary in my mouth when I'm

2223
01:22:51,149 --> 01:22:55,949

2399
01:31:20,069 --> 01:31:22,889
was a little rambling

2400
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,659
I apologize it was a lot of rambly but

2401
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:26,160

2477
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:38,199
I got my medical marijuana card renewed

2478
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:40,599
dude the process has gotten super simple

2479
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:42,880
I pretty much called made an appointment

2480
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:44,140
I showed up they got me in at my

2481
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,279
scheduled appointment time that's the

2482
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:47,890
first time that's ever happened at a

2483
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:51,519
Medical Marijuana doctor ah they got me

2484
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:55,090
in there I mean they got my it's a it's

2485
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,920
not a license guys it's nobody here has

2486
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:58,960
a marijuana license it's a medical

2487
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:00,579
marijuana recommendation from a doctor

2488
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,869
that's not a prescription it's not a

2489
01:35:00,579 --> 01:35:04,409
license so he writes out a

2490
01:35:01,869 --> 01:35:07,000
recommendation for you and then um you

2491
01:35:04,409 --> 01:35:08,649
know I was debating if I wanted to talk

2492
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,119
about this or not on the table and the

2493
01:35:08,649 --> 01:35:12,789
doctor's office there's just a little

2494
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:14,649
sign and it says increased black count

2495
01:35:12,789 --> 01:35:17,260
will require records and then there's a

2496
01:35:14,649 --> 01:35:18,699
dollar sign and then an amount of plants

2497
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:20,289
and then another dollar sign and an

2498
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:22,809
amount of plants and if you provide

2499
01:35:20,289 --> 01:35:25,119
records and you tell this doctor that

2500
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:27,100
you were in need of a higher plant count

2501
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:29,409
he will increase your plant count for a

2502
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:30,490
small fee so if you're not a Colorado

2503
01:35:29,409 --> 01:35:32,380
resident and if you're not familiar with

2504
01:35:30,489 --> 01:35:34,059
all that that means is when you go to

2505
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:34,989
this doctor when you get your medical

2506
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:38,590
marijuana card

2507
01:35:34,988 --> 01:35:40,988
now allowed to grow six plants in your

2508
01:35:38,590 --> 01:35:43,659
private residence these doctors are now

2509
01:35:40,988 --> 01:35:45,998
able to write in recommendations that

2510
01:35:43,658 --> 01:35:48,279
you are able to grow more cannabis and

2511
01:35:45,998 --> 01:35:50,679
possess more cannabis than the original

2512
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:52,658
six but to do that you've got to bring a

2513
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:54,190
little bit of doctor note some sort of

2514
01:35:52,658 --> 01:35:56,049
history some sort of record saying that

2515
01:35:54,189 --> 01:35:59,408
something's wrong with you and you also

2516
01:35:56,050 --> 01:36:00,610
have to pay a fee so for a small fee I

2517
01:35:59,408 --> 01:36:01,779
walked out of there with a handsome

2518
01:36:00,609 --> 01:36:02,920
plant count I won't talk about the

2519
01:36:01,779 --> 01:36:04,029
numbers on the show I don't really have

2520
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:06,248
a huge plant count I don't need that

2521
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:07,779
many I just want it to be safe so and I

2522
01:36:06,248 --> 01:36:09,519
went for what he would give me just see

2523
01:36:07,779 --> 01:36:11,859
if he would do it and I got the highest

2524
01:36:09,519 --> 01:36:14,590
he offered there so that was super easy

2525
01:36:11,859 --> 01:36:17,018
I want to talk about the benefits of

2526
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:18,639
doing that um the reason I did is

2527
01:36:17,019 --> 01:36:20,289
because of course I grow and I want to

2528
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:23,199
keep my grow protected with my medical

2529
01:36:20,288 --> 01:36:24,609
marijuana card that allows me it gives

2530
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:27,460
me a little bit more safety I feel like

2531
01:36:24,609 --> 01:36:30,130
and also the recreational shops are

2532
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:32,078
really high priced if you were to buy a

2533
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:34,059
gram of hash at a recreational shop it

2534
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:37,058
would cost you probably twice as much as

2535
01:36:34,059 --> 01:36:40,360
it would at a medical shop so I keep my

2536
01:36:37,059 --> 01:36:42,969
medical marijuana privileges intact a

2537
01:36:40,359 --> 01:36:44,828
lot for that because sometimes I do run

2538
01:36:42,969 --> 01:36:46,118
out of shatter and I have to go I go to

2539
01:36:44,828 --> 01:36:48,189
green and healthy wellness and Colorado

2540
01:36:46,118 --> 01:36:51,219
Springs and I purchased grams of hash

2541
01:36:48,189 --> 01:36:54,549
from our friends hunt and the Jordans

2542
01:36:51,219 --> 01:36:56,948
and the John's a bit healthy walnut so

2543
01:36:54,550 --> 01:37:00,279
that's a good reason to keep my medical

2544
01:36:56,948 --> 01:37:01,719
marijuana card intact so I talked about

2545
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:03,488
the benefits I talked about the process

2546
01:37:01,719 --> 01:37:04,719
and I talked about the cost I feel like

2547
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:06,158
you cover the medical marijuana card

2548
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,408
experience it was super easy this time

2549
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:09,609
I'm not gonna say the doctor's name or

2550
01:37:08,408 --> 01:37:11,109
anything on the podcast but if you'd

2551
01:37:09,609 --> 01:37:12,488
like his information just email me it's

2552
01:37:11,109 --> 01:37:14,049
grow from a heart of hotmail.com and

2553
01:37:12,488 --> 01:37:15,729
I'll get you that doctor he is in Pueblo

2554
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:17,260
Colorado so if you're looking for a

2555
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:19,419
doctor in Pueblo I've got a

2556
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:20,679
recommendation for you let's move on to

2557
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:21,940
my next topic I really want to get to

2558
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:23,819
the grow lesson but I've got a few

2559
01:37:21,939 --> 01:37:26,288
things written down that I want to cover

2560
01:37:23,819 --> 01:37:27,939
this is just kind of a personal thing I

2561
01:37:26,288 --> 01:37:32,170
keep seeing a lot of people talking

2562
01:37:27,939 --> 01:37:34,029
about the temperature of their email the

2563
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:37,020
email is the little box that plugs into

2564
01:37:34,029 --> 01:37:39,840
the wall that's got a

2565
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:41,160
an LED or an LCD display on there's

2566
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,890
usually an LED right little LED light

2567
01:37:41,159 --> 01:37:45,059
display shows numbers and then it's got

2568
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:46,410
an up-and-down switch on it you can make

2569
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,090
the temperature hotter and cooler and

2570
01:37:46,409 --> 01:37:49,349
then the one I have actually has a USB

2571
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:50,699
port in it so that you can charge your

2572
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:52,140
iPhone or whatever kind of phone you got

2573
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:53,399
on there but then it's got a little cord

2574
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:55,350
that comes out and it attaches to the

2575
01:37:53,399 --> 01:37:56,519
nail and it heats up the nail 40 all the

2576
01:37:55,350 --> 01:38:00,000
time so that's the email then your dad

2577
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:04,500
nail is always hot right is it

2578
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,960
temperature on your nail does not match

2579
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:08,130
what the numbers on that box say that's

2580
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,590
what I'm trying to get to here that's

2581
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:12,090
gonna be my point a lot of people say

2582
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:14,940
they've seen pictures of my email and

2583
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:18,140
right now it's flashing at 8:52 it's

2584
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:20,069
jumping between 850 and 850 - and

2585
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:22,079
honestly if you try to take a DAB with

2586
01:38:20,069 --> 01:38:23,849
that 852 degrees I feel like that'd be

2587
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,010
too hot but that is not a representation

2588
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:29,579
of degrees that is simply a setting on

2589
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:31,440
the box I don't think that and maybe

2590
01:38:29,579 --> 01:38:33,029
there is one brand maybe one or two

2591
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:36,869
brands that does this but I don't think

2592
01:38:33,029 --> 01:38:38,789
that that coil is sending the

2593
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:40,079
temperature to that nail and all the way

2594
01:38:38,789 --> 01:38:43,470
back to there and telling it that it's

2595
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:46,289
860 degrees that is more of a setting

2596
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:48,240
like a like if you turn your volume on

2597
01:38:46,289 --> 01:38:50,640
your car stereo to 11 you're not putting

2598
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:52,529
out 11 anything so you're just on 11 you

2599
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:54,090
know that 11 is like I know that my car

2600
01:38:52,529 --> 01:38:55,710
stereo I can crank it up to about 28

2601
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:58,440
before the subwoofer starts sounding

2602
01:38:55,710 --> 01:39:00,539
like complete crap so I know that 26 is

2603
01:38:58,439 --> 01:39:02,429
my ideal temp on my car stereo it

2604
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:04,439
doesn't mean I'm putting out 26 anything

2605
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:05,460
in particulars it's just the level where

2606
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:07,769
it is and that's what I think your

2607
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:10,680
emails are doing we have established

2608
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:13,260
that the 816 I'm seeing on my screen

2609
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:16,010
right now on my LED is actually a

2610
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:18,180
frequency that is being put out and

2611
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:20,880
that's what's being measured by that

2612
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:22,530
number so you got to keep in mind that

2613
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,060
that number has to travel all the way

2614
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:26,189
down the cord and then it has to get to

2615
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:28,650
the coil and that coil is the heating

2616
01:39:26,189 --> 01:39:30,000
part that coil has to heat whatever type

2617
01:39:28,649 --> 01:39:31,109
of nail you're using I'm using this new

2618
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,960
highly educated

2619
01:39:31,109 --> 01:39:34,979
it's the email insert which one is it

2620
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,460
it's got the name printed on it let me

2621
01:39:34,979 --> 01:39:37,349
read it

2622
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:43,380
I knew the name until I started talking

2623
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:44,579
it is the HED adapter so I'm using that

2624
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:46,500
one so you've got to heat up this

2625
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:47,970
barrel-shaped piece and then the head of

2626
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:49,639
the nail heats up after that is the

2627
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:52,280
heats gotta travel

2628
01:39:49,639 --> 01:39:54,650
for it to know what the exact heat is on

2629
01:39:52,279 --> 01:39:56,750
the head of that nail would be kind of

2630
01:39:54,649 --> 01:39:59,448
kind of ridiculous to ask of that device

2631
01:39:56,750 --> 01:40:01,310
so my point is that number doesn't match

2632
01:39:59,448 --> 01:40:04,549
that head of the nail guys that is a

2633
01:40:01,310 --> 01:40:07,159
frequency or a dial setting so when you

2634
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:08,630
find the ideal number just remember that

2635
01:40:07,158 --> 01:40:10,039
ideal number and that's kind of where

2636
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:13,159
you want to be you're not actually

2637
01:40:10,039 --> 01:40:14,868
getting at 856 degrees or I've seen some

2638
01:40:13,158 --> 01:40:16,879
of them said perfectly 710 because

2639
01:40:14,868 --> 01:40:18,198
people think that's the perfect temp the

2640
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,118
number is not correlating to the nail

2641
01:40:18,198 --> 01:40:22,279
you guys so when you see my pictures in

2642
01:40:20,118 --> 01:40:24,710
a/c 850 quit bitching at me I think

2643
01:40:22,279 --> 01:40:30,170
that's my point here all right I have

2644
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:33,079
another topic written down the next one

2645
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:35,868
oh the pesticide issue man we talked

2646
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:37,010
about this a little bit in a previous

2647
01:40:35,868 --> 01:40:39,589
episode I talked about some of the

2648
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:41,810
dispensaries that got in trouble and I

2649
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:42,770
saw a quick article scroll through my

2650
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:45,469
phone here should've been a little more

2651
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:48,409
prepared people are kind of upset about

2652
01:40:45,469 --> 01:40:52,250
this pesticide issue and here's what I

2653
01:40:48,408 --> 01:40:54,488
saw this was all over it was Oliver

2654
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:56,810
social media websites today it says

2655
01:40:54,488 --> 01:40:58,609
pesticide violations were issued to the

2656
01:40:56,810 --> 01:41:00,980
following recreational marijuana grow

2657
01:40:58,609 --> 01:41:03,109
facilities and then it lists mindful

2658
01:41:00,979 --> 01:41:06,468
green solutions evolutionary Holdings

2659
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:09,408
Green Cross Colorado MMJ America organic

2660
01:41:06,469 --> 01:41:11,960
greens altitude East treatments are Ino

2661
01:41:09,408 --> 01:41:14,868
and sweet leaf all violators were using

2662
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:16,929
eagle 20 and petroleum-based fungicide

2663
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:19,189
that is harmful to humans and animals

2664
01:41:16,929 --> 01:41:21,500
altitude each treatments was also using

2665
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:23,960
mallet and habit both harmful to humans

2666
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:25,729
and animals drink ross denver was also

2667
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:27,829
using mallet many of these violations

2668
01:41:25,729 --> 01:41:29,718
are well known and then it goes on to

2669
01:41:27,829 --> 01:41:30,979
talk about a lot more stuff you know I

2670
01:41:29,719 --> 01:41:32,510
don't know the original source of that

2671
01:41:30,979 --> 01:41:34,368
because I've seen it cut and pasted on

2672
01:41:32,510 --> 01:41:35,449
so many different social media sites

2673
01:41:34,368 --> 01:41:38,289
that I don't know who to give credit to

2674
01:41:35,448 --> 01:41:41,988
that but uh these guys were spraying

2675
01:41:38,289 --> 01:41:44,479
Eagle 20 on plants and then selling

2676
01:41:41,988 --> 01:41:46,549
those buds to people and the weird part

2677
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:48,829
here is MMJ America just won a cannabis

2678
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:50,719
cup so what's going on with that these

2679
01:41:48,829 --> 01:41:52,698
guys are did they enter their Eagle 20

2680
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:55,219
Laden buds into the cannabis cup or are

2681
01:41:52,698 --> 01:41:56,629
they growing separate cups or separate

2682
01:41:55,219 --> 01:41:58,158
crops and entering that and not even

2683
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:59,010
giving the public a chance to go by that

2684
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:00,750
because

2685
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:03,780
suspect if that's what some of the shops

2686
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:05,340
do so these plants have been taken off

2687
01:42:03,779 --> 01:42:07,738
the market those plants will never make

2688
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:10,890
it to harvest and those buds will never

2689
01:42:07,738 --> 01:42:13,469
be sold to customers or patients but I'm

2690
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:16,050
sure that there was medicine or product

2691
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:17,850
that did make it out of the door and has

2692
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:19,619
been treated with eagle 20 or whatever

2693
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:21,570
else they were listening here that we

2694
01:42:19,619 --> 01:42:23,340
definitely should not be consuming if

2695
01:42:21,569 --> 01:42:25,109
this were to happen - if these were

2696
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:26,400
tomatoes and they discovered that these

2697
01:42:25,109 --> 01:42:29,789
people had been spraying Tomatoes with

2698
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:31,500
these products the tomato farmer or

2699
01:42:29,789 --> 01:42:33,750
distributor or whoever's in charge at

2700
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:35,340
that point would have to go make some

2701
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:37,319
sort of a press release and apologize

2702
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:38,610
they'd have to be held accountable this

2703
01:42:37,319 --> 01:42:39,988
would have been a much larger deal if

2704
01:42:38,609 --> 01:42:42,000
this would have been another

2705
01:42:39,988 --> 01:42:44,579
agricultural product or a horticultural

2706
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,170
product and what's ridiculous is the

2707
01:42:44,579 --> 01:42:48,988
cannabis industry makes so much money

2708
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:51,329
that they should have been kind of on

2709
01:42:48,988 --> 01:42:53,459
top of this and been doing the right

2710
01:42:51,329 --> 01:42:55,019
thing anyway like we're getting a legal

2711
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:56,399
cannabis here and then we're trying to

2712
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:58,530
set the pace here and then they're gonna

2713
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:00,389
go and do [ __ ] like this which really

2714
01:42:58,529 --> 01:43:02,609
puts I don't know kind of a black eye on

2715
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:03,840
the legal cannabis industry I don't know

2716
01:43:02,609 --> 01:43:05,399
I think that the people that were a

2717
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,860
leading industry should have been more

2718
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:10,529
responsible with our industry all right

2719
01:43:07,859 --> 01:43:11,880
so I can't seem to not shop at those

2720
01:43:10,529 --> 01:43:13,139
stores or anything like that do what you

2721
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:14,460
want to do but I would definitely pay

2722
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:16,079
more attention to where my medicine is

2723
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:17,579
coming from and I would pay more

2724
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:19,829
attention to what's going in my medicine

2725
01:43:17,579 --> 01:43:21,359
all the more reason you guys to grow

2726
01:43:19,829 --> 01:43:23,430
your own cannabis that's my solution

2727
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:24,839
that's what I think I've got a couple

2728
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:27,869
more notes what else did I want to get

2729
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:29,130
on to actually we're gonna let's just

2730
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:31,409
get right to it I want to talk about

2731
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:32,970
grow room scheduling you guys we're ten

2732
01:43:31,409 --> 01:43:36,659
minutes into the show already and I have

2733
01:43:32,970 --> 01:43:39,030
got a lot of notes here so this is

2734
01:43:36,659 --> 01:43:41,729
probably gonna end up taking us a couple

2735
01:43:39,029 --> 01:43:43,738
of episodes here honestly so we're gonna

2736
01:43:41,729 --> 01:43:47,129
get through the veg process today and

2737
01:43:43,738 --> 01:43:49,859
then the next lesson we'll be planning

2738
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:52,440
your flowering cycles so I wrote a whole

2739
01:43:49,859 --> 01:43:53,969
bunch of stuff and honestly it took me a

2740
01:43:52,439 --> 01:43:56,039
little bit to get this together because

2741
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:57,869
I and I'm gonna apologize right now I

2742
01:43:56,039 --> 01:43:59,670
know that the last few episodes have

2743
01:43:57,869 --> 01:44:01,619
been a little wonky I seriously had a

2744
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:04,470
major concussion and I can't focus to

2745
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:06,149
write long long things like I used to

2746
01:44:04,470 --> 01:44:08,340
long lessons and [ __ ] it's coming back

2747
01:44:06,149 --> 01:44:10,229
to me slowly but it takes me a little

2748
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:11,630
more effort and a lot more time to focus

2749
01:44:10,229 --> 01:44:14,000
and write down [ __ ]

2750
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:15,199
so please bear with me but the lessons

2751
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,850
are coming back things are getting

2752
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:18,500
better I know that things have not been

2753
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:19,910
the way they should be with the show but

2754
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,020
I have not been the way I should be so I

2755
01:44:19,909 --> 01:44:22,789
couldn't bring you the show you needed

2756
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:24,170
I'm getting my [ __ ] back together which

2757
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:26,960
means the show is getting at [ __ ] back

2758
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:30,170
together - I apologize for being kind of

2759
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:31,880
slacking off but I didn't even know when

2760
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:33,289
you get a head injury you don't know

2761
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,810
what the hell is going on and it's crazy

2762
01:44:33,289 --> 01:44:37,100
weird so I'm getting back to it the

2763
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:38,510
show's getting back to it so let me

2764
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:41,270
prove that to you here's what I have

2765
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:42,770
written and I have got a lot here I

2766
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:44,270
think I'm gonna try to read it off the

2767
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:45,920
computer because the phone screen is

2768
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:47,930
tiny let's put the same thing here on

2769
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,720
the phone same thing on the computer

2770
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:53,480
does it match up dated all right we're

2771
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:57,199
gonna read it off the phone it goes like

2772
01:44:53,479 --> 01:45:00,109
this so an average bro should take about

2773
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:02,329
100 to 120 days maybe 150 days total in

2774
01:45:00,109 --> 01:45:05,269
the soil before harvesting drying

2775
01:45:02,329 --> 01:45:06,649
trimming and curing our goal our goal is

2776
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:08,540
to provide our plants with optimal

2777
01:45:06,649 --> 01:45:10,460
conditions appropriate feedings careful

2778
01:45:08,539 --> 01:45:12,170
training and selective pruning in order

2779
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:14,779
to produce the finest medicine we can

2780
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:17,000
offer to our patients or clients I think

2781
01:45:14,779 --> 01:45:18,590
that every day in each cycle is an

2782
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,789
opportunity to show the plants some love

2783
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:22,010
and help your crop reach its full

2784
01:45:19,789 --> 01:45:24,289
potential I feel like each feeding each

2785
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:26,060
application of tea's bug sprays foliar

2786
01:45:24,289 --> 01:45:27,979
feeding and any interaction with your

2787
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:29,450
plants is your chance to make sure your

2788
01:45:27,979 --> 01:45:32,329
crop reaches your clients expectations

2789
01:45:29,449 --> 01:45:34,010
and the plants full potential a great

2790
01:45:32,329 --> 01:45:36,170
way to improve your crops is to start a

2791
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:37,760
solid grow schedule today I want to talk

2792
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:39,680
about two different schedules a grower

2793
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:41,840
should be on top of the first schedule

2794
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:43,340
will be the basic planning of a crop

2795
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,289
from seed to clone all the way up to

2796
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:47,329
harvest time I want to discuss the

2797
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:49,399
phases of growth from a small cloner

2798
01:45:47,329 --> 01:45:51,319
seedling into vegetative growth into the

2799
01:45:49,399 --> 01:45:53,059
flowering phase on a breakdown the

2800
01:45:51,319 --> 01:45:54,529
flowering phase in two trimesters and

2801
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:55,880
talk about what the plants are doing and

2802
01:45:54,529 --> 01:45:58,309
what they want through the flowering

2803
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:00,260
phase I'll also talk about what you

2804
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:03,260
could be doing at each phase to improve

2805
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:05,150
your harvest um I wrote here that if I

2806
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:07,310
can get you through 120 day girl lesson

2807
01:46:05,149 --> 01:46:08,569
in this episode I'll just start my I'll

2808
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:09,950
start my discussion on planning a

2809
01:46:08,569 --> 01:46:11,779
schedule that keeps your grow spaced

2810
01:46:09,949 --> 01:46:14,329
producing as much herb as possible with

2811
01:46:11,779 --> 01:46:15,859
as little downtime as possible this of

2812
01:46:14,329 --> 01:46:18,109
course will take multiple lights and at

2813
01:46:15,859 --> 01:46:19,759
least two small grow spaces but setting

2814
01:46:18,109 --> 01:46:21,409
up a small perpetual grow to keep

2815
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:24,140
yourself supplied with head stash is

2816
01:46:21,409 --> 01:46:25,349
probably easier than you think I realize

2817
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:26,610
now that I've written way too

2818
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:28,260
much for one episode so this is

2819
01:46:26,609 --> 01:46:30,809
definitely gonna be broken down you guys

2820
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:32,100
so here's what we get into it before you

2821
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:33,930
begin your grow I suggest getting

2822
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:36,240
yourself a planner and making a schedule

2823
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:37,740
in advance you can be flexible because

2824
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:39,840
these are plants but try to stick with

2825
01:46:37,739 --> 01:46:42,359
your plan if you can I also suggest

2826
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:44,819
taking a lot of notes you guys take a

2827
01:46:42,359 --> 01:46:46,859
lot of notes don't wonder what you did

2828
01:46:44,819 --> 01:46:48,949
to that plant to make it so special

2829
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:52,920
write down what you did so that you know

2830
01:46:48,949 --> 01:46:55,710
all right so here's where I'll describe

2831
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:57,149
the phases of growth and timeframes of

2832
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:59,609
our plants I said that this grows gonna

2833
01:46:57,149 --> 01:47:02,399
take about 100 to 120 days if you want

2834
01:46:59,609 --> 01:47:03,929
to go larger plants you can go to 150

2835
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:05,519
I've seen people take a lot longer

2836
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:06,470
that's the vege period is what you're

2837
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,940
gonna make your difference there so

2838
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:10,680
we'll start off with seedlings or clones

2839
01:47:08,939 --> 01:47:13,379
right and that's gonna take about 14

2840
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:15,270
days to be in the seedling phase I think

2841
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:17,699
about 14 days when you start germinating

2842
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:18,990
it from the day you germinate it so the

2843
01:47:17,699 --> 01:47:21,239
day it's like a little plant it's about

2844
01:47:18,989 --> 01:47:23,550
14 days we're gonna call that 14 days a

2845
01:47:21,239 --> 01:47:25,619
clone takes about 14 days to root and

2846
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:27,390
get ready to be a plant so I'm gonna say

2847
01:47:25,619 --> 01:47:30,090
seedling and clone phase is about 14

2848
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:32,250
days the veg growth depends on your goal

2849
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:34,110
you guys if you want to veg if you're

2850
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:35,819
going in small pots you can veg for 2

2851
01:47:34,109 --> 01:47:36,899
weeks if you're gonna go into larger

2852
01:47:35,819 --> 01:47:39,299
pots you can veg

2853
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:41,670
I've seen people veg for 3045 days I've

2854
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:43,829
also seen guys veg for 60 days some of

2855
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:46,199
the outdoor plants that people veg for

2856
01:47:43,829 --> 01:47:47,130
the the early start of the year before

2857
01:47:46,199 --> 01:47:49,050
the outdoor season

2858
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:51,569
I've seen people veg plants were 4 or 5

2859
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:53,010
or 6 months to put them outside so

2860
01:47:51,569 --> 01:47:54,119
what's gonna happen is your plants are

2861
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:57,300
gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger

2862
01:47:54,119 --> 01:47:59,099
it's a longer you veg so we're just

2863
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:01,110
gonna go for a short veg in this one

2864
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:02,820
so you're flowering phase I'm gonna go

2865
01:48:01,109 --> 01:48:04,769
for a nine-week flowering phase most of

2866
01:48:02,819 --> 01:48:07,139
the plants I work with are about 9 to 10

2867
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:09,120
weeks nine weeks is a good number

2868
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:11,160
because that gives us three trimesters

2869
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:12,599
of three weeks you should talk about I

2870
01:48:11,159 --> 01:48:16,680
can talk about my theory of the

2871
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:18,090
trimesters on the plants so yeah that'll

2872
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:20,670
help us out so we got 14 days in

2873
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:22,350
seedling 63 days and flowering are you

2874
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:25,020
looking at 77 days there that gives us

2875
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:28,950
about 30 days to veg and fix any

2876
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:31,770
problems so let's just basically start a

2877
01:48:28,949 --> 01:48:33,380
short grow from cedar clone this is kind

2878
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:35,730
of the drama to talk about now is

2879
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:37,680
basically the type I would of grow I

2880
01:48:35,729 --> 01:48:39,328
would do if I were searching through a

2881
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:41,399
10 pack of seeds to find the

2882
01:48:39,328 --> 01:48:43,588
purrs in the pack so for this I would

2883
01:48:41,399 --> 01:48:46,199
usually use like a three gallon pot or a

2884
01:48:43,588 --> 01:48:48,809
five gallon pot and I would use I don't

2885
01:48:46,198 --> 01:48:50,788
know probably like between nine and

2886
01:48:48,809 --> 01:48:51,929
sixteen just depends on how small I'm

2887
01:48:50,788 --> 01:48:53,219
gonna keep the plants and how tight I

2888
01:48:51,929 --> 01:48:54,929
want to cramp them in the space under

2889
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:57,628
the light there's just one light as all

2890
01:48:54,929 --> 01:48:58,918
I'm talking about right now so if we

2891
01:48:57,628 --> 01:49:00,328
start from seeds or clones the only

2892
01:48:58,918 --> 01:49:02,128
difference will be the first two weeks

2893
01:49:00,328 --> 01:49:03,358
really once the clones root and the

2894
01:49:02,128 --> 01:49:05,128
seedlings take off everything I'm

2895
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:06,780
talking about is gonna work the same for

2896
01:49:05,128 --> 01:49:08,578
seeds in clumps if you're working with

2897
01:49:06,779 --> 01:49:10,018
seeds you'll have to be sure that you

2898
01:49:08,578 --> 01:49:11,398
eliminate the males before we get too

2899
01:49:10,019 --> 01:49:14,729
far into flower but that's gonna be your

2900
01:49:11,399 --> 01:49:16,229
major difference so let's start with

2901
01:49:14,729 --> 01:49:17,609
this I will say this is like if we're

2902
01:49:16,229 --> 01:49:19,889
starting day one will say start day one

2903
01:49:17,609 --> 01:49:22,260
right now so today we we would cut our

2904
01:49:19,889 --> 01:49:23,878
clones and start germinating our seeds

2905
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:25,349
I'm not gonna do any lessons on

2906
01:49:23,878 --> 01:49:26,578
germinating seeds or cutting clones

2907
01:49:25,349 --> 01:49:29,010
because I'm pretty sure I've covered

2908
01:49:26,578 --> 01:49:31,049
that in past episodes if you need a

2909
01:49:29,010 --> 01:49:32,909
refresher course go back and listen to

2910
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:34,949
those or if you guys want a brand new

2911
01:49:32,908 --> 01:49:36,208
episode on that email me and I will go

2912
01:49:34,948 --> 01:49:37,948
back and listen to the old episode and

2913
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:39,510
I'll try to do an update for you but

2914
01:49:37,948 --> 01:49:41,069
only enough enough people asked for it

2915
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:43,409
that episodes out there so it should

2916
01:49:41,069 --> 01:49:45,448
work so we cut our clones we start our

2917
01:49:43,408 --> 01:49:46,948
seeds for day one this is where you want

2918
01:49:45,448 --> 01:49:48,708
to mark the date get out your grow

2919
01:49:46,948 --> 01:49:51,208
calendar and Mark it today is day one

2920
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:52,618
for clothes and seeds I recommend a 24

2921
01:49:51,208 --> 01:49:54,628
hour light cycle you guys to start the

2922
01:49:52,618 --> 01:49:56,368
first couple of weeks the first few days

2923
01:49:54,628 --> 01:49:58,260
are just a waiting game pretty much if

2924
01:49:56,368 --> 01:50:00,268
you're waiting for seeds they'll pop up

2925
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:02,010
they'll pop up from whatever medium

2926
01:50:00,269 --> 01:50:03,599
you've put them in in like 48 hours

2927
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:04,708
hopefully or maybe it'll take them a

2928
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:06,599
couple days to start growing to the

2929
01:50:04,708 --> 01:50:10,069
light I suggest putting your seedlings

2930
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:12,538
into I use beer cups like Solo cups ah

2931
01:50:10,069 --> 01:50:14,759
put those put your seedlings into the

2932
01:50:12,538 --> 01:50:16,050
cups the white potting mix with plenty

2933
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:18,659
of drainage and holes in the bottoms of

2934
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:20,070
the cups of course once your seedlings

2935
01:50:18,658 --> 01:50:21,328
have developed a nice tap root of like

2936
01:50:20,069 --> 01:50:23,099
about an inch to three inches long

2937
01:50:21,328 --> 01:50:25,408
that's when you want to throw those in

2938
01:50:23,099 --> 01:50:27,328
your dirt so cones will be lazy but

2939
01:50:25,408 --> 01:50:28,228
they'll root around 10 to 14 days some

2940
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:30,058
of you guys are gonna take a little

2941
01:50:28,229 --> 01:50:31,530
longer to get your clones to root it's

2942
01:50:30,059 --> 01:50:34,739
all about a healthy mother plant a good

2943
01:50:31,529 --> 01:50:35,969
rooting environment be patient and if it

2944
01:50:34,738 --> 01:50:37,708
takes you more time to get your clones

2945
01:50:35,969 --> 01:50:39,448
rooted just plan that into your next run

2946
01:50:37,708 --> 01:50:41,458
give yourself an extra week on extra

2947
01:50:39,448 --> 01:50:42,808
five days whatever it takes and then

2948
01:50:41,458 --> 01:50:44,010
you'll start learning how to keep

2949
01:50:42,809 --> 01:50:45,418
healthier mother plants you'll start

2950
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:46,708
learning how to clone better and you'll

2951
01:50:45,418 --> 01:50:49,050
speed up your cloning time it'll get

2952
01:50:46,708 --> 01:50:50,309
better take a lot of extra clones at

2953
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:51,510
first cuz they're gonna die if you're

2954
01:50:50,309 --> 01:50:51,960
not good at cloning if you're new at

2955
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:54,989
this

2956
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:57,630
take extras because you will lose some

2957
01:50:54,988 --> 01:50:59,309
and don't be sad about it so after

2958
01:50:57,630 --> 01:51:00,659
several days let's see where was I the

2959
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:02,039
seedings ceilings are gonna start

2960
01:51:00,659 --> 01:51:04,109
growing tall and skinny in the first few

2961
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:05,579
days after several days they'll develop

2962
01:51:04,109 --> 01:51:07,229
their first true leaves by this time the

2963
01:51:05,579 --> 01:51:09,059
clones are rooted and ready for cups and

2964
01:51:07,229 --> 01:51:11,399
the seedlings will be small plants and

2965
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:12,960
catching up to the clones so I wouldn't

2966
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:15,000
feed the seedlings until about 7 to 10

2967
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,800
days in and when you do feed them focus

2968
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,529
on root inoculant and building a good

2969
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:21,690
root base for the plants I like a worm

2970
01:51:19,529 --> 01:51:24,119
casting tea or something like that maybe

2971
01:51:21,689 --> 01:51:27,179
something like great white you can use a

2972
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:28,409
GT something something that focuses on

2973
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:31,860
root inoculants you want

2974
01:51:28,409 --> 01:51:32,789
trichoderma yeah you guys hopefully

2975
01:51:31,859 --> 01:51:33,389
you've caught on to what I'm talking

2976
01:51:32,789 --> 01:51:35,460
about by now

2977
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:37,380
I've talked a lot about root inoculant

2978
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:38,579
with Shawn so I would feed the clones

2979
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:41,219
the same thing when you put those into

2980
01:51:38,579 --> 01:51:42,630
cups I definitely like to feed my clones

2981
01:51:41,219 --> 01:51:45,300
and my seedlings a lot of root

2982
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:47,880
inoculants to get that soil funky and

2983
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:49,739
get the roots FAT FAT better roots the

2984
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:53,279
better the fruits is what I say all the

2985
01:51:49,738 --> 01:51:54,659
time so by now I feel like we should be

2986
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:56,159
putting our clones into cups and

2987
01:51:54,659 --> 01:51:59,488
starting week 3 if everything went

2988
01:51:56,159 --> 01:52:00,630
correctly we fed the plants once now

2989
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:02,039
this makes me feel like everything is

2990
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:03,390
one lesson now now that we've gotten to

2991
01:52:02,039 --> 01:52:04,469
week three in the clones and the

2992
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:05,550
seedlings are caught up I feel like

2993
01:52:04,469 --> 01:52:07,500
there won't be much difference between

2994
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:09,090
the cloud and the seedling clone and the

2995
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:10,469
seedling that was hard to say the

2996
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:12,029
seedlings may grow more quickly because

2997
01:52:10,469 --> 01:52:13,500
they have what we call seed vigor but

2998
01:52:12,029 --> 01:52:16,079
that's not always the case if you have

2999
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:17,729
good clones I've seen some clones

3000
01:52:16,079 --> 01:52:19,949
outgrow seedlings before it's been kind

3001
01:52:17,729 --> 01:52:21,269
of surprising so all we've done up to

3002
01:52:19,949 --> 01:52:23,340
this point is pretty much plant our

3003
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:25,380
seeds and clones we've gotten our

3004
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:26,760
starter plants in two cups and we've fed

3005
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:28,829
them some worm tea or some root

3006
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:31,289
inoculant maybe some great white maybe

3007
01:52:28,829 --> 01:52:34,409
some o GT something like that to get

3008
01:52:31,289 --> 01:52:35,939
them started and now I'm gonna call this

3009
01:52:34,409 --> 01:52:38,010
the beginning of veg some people may

3010
01:52:35,939 --> 01:52:41,609
call it pre veg because we haven't done

3011
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:43,079
into our big pots yet but I'm gonna call

3012
01:52:41,609 --> 01:52:44,488
it veg starting now now that we've

3013
01:52:43,079 --> 01:52:46,170
gotten out of the cloner now that we're

3014
01:52:44,488 --> 01:52:48,779
not little baby seedlings anymore I'm

3015
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:50,520
gonna say we're into veg so the veg

3016
01:52:48,779 --> 01:52:52,710
state can last as long as you want

3017
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:55,350
the longer you veg like I said earlier

3018
01:52:52,710 --> 01:52:57,840
the larger your plants are gonna get the

3019
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:59,610
veg phase is where we do 90% of the

3020
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:02,250
topping training and pruning of your

3021
01:52:59,609 --> 01:53:03,719
plants we kind of do a lesson on topping

3022
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:05,880
and stuff like that but I plan to do

3023
01:53:03,719 --> 01:53:07,619
another episode all about improved

3024
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:09,389
your crops and improving your improving

3025
01:53:07,619 --> 01:53:11,698
your yields and things so that'll come

3026
01:53:09,389 --> 01:53:13,889
in handy also your plants are gonna take

3027
01:53:11,698 --> 01:53:15,629
up 90% of the nitrogen that they use

3028
01:53:13,889 --> 01:53:18,359
through their entire lives during the

3029
01:53:15,630 --> 01:53:20,219
veg estate vegetative phase of their

3030
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:21,960
plants people tend to really overlook

3031
01:53:20,219 --> 01:53:23,310
the veg phase and they focus only on the

3032
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:26,189
bloom phase because that's when you can

3033
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:28,710
see your buds but the veg phase is just

3034
01:53:26,189 --> 01:53:30,238
as important and so is your veg space

3035
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:32,639
you guys a lot of people don't spend the

3036
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:34,738
time building a proper veg room and now

3037
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:36,300
it really would help you out if you if

3038
01:53:34,738 --> 01:53:37,589
you teach those kids how to run before

3039
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:40,380
you put them on the track they'd be a

3040
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:41,579
lot better performing kid so I feel like

3041
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:43,739
if we use each day as a chance to

3042
01:53:41,579 --> 01:53:47,100
prepare the plants for bloom our crop

3043
01:53:43,738 --> 01:53:48,809
will look much better at harvest time my

3044
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:52,350
veg phase for my example of this grow is

3045
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:53,460
gonna be short you guys gosh press pause

3046
01:53:52,350 --> 01:53:54,960
and take a drink I'll probably take a

3047
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:57,060
dabble on that excuse me for one second

3048
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:59,460
alright guys I feel like we are at the

3049
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:01,500
beginning of veg is where I left off so

3050
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:02,939
I like to feed my plants the first day

3051
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:05,069
of each week Monday's are usually my

3052
01:54:02,939 --> 01:54:06,599
feeding day for my personal crops for me

3053
01:54:05,069 --> 01:54:08,460
starting everything on a Monday helps me

3054
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:11,280
keep track of everything so in the first

3055
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:14,189
day of veg I would feed my plants a nice

3056
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:16,019
base nutrient a white humic acid some

3057
01:54:14,189 --> 01:54:18,569
potassium silicates to build strong cell

3058
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:20,760
walls and I would also keep focusing on

3059
01:54:18,569 --> 01:54:22,229
root development we shouldn't need any

3060
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,969
cal-mag or anything like that for the

3061
01:54:22,229 --> 01:54:25,799
first couple of weeks everything should

3062
01:54:23,969 --> 01:54:27,448
be cool so for the first couple of weeks

3063
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:28,710
your plan should be cooling the cups but

3064
01:54:27,448 --> 01:54:30,719
we're gonna have to plant them into

3065
01:54:28,710 --> 01:54:32,130
larger pots pretty soon you don't want

3066
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:33,630
to see them get root bound in those cups

3067
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:35,159
and they'll also get tall and skinny we

3068
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:36,300
want them to Bush out a little bit so

3069
01:54:35,158 --> 01:54:38,158
when we put them into a larger pot

3070
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:40,829
they'll start pushing out so it's also a

3071
01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:43,619
good time to adjust your lights from 24

3072
01:54:40,829 --> 01:54:46,859
hours to an 18-6 schedule you want them

3073
01:54:43,619 --> 01:54:48,510
on for 18 hours off for 6 plants like a

3074
01:54:46,859 --> 01:54:50,939
rest period and it's also gonna save you

3075
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:52,679
money on your energy bill so now you've

3076
01:54:50,939 --> 01:54:54,779
got your plants in two cups they're nice

3077
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:56,300
and healthy they're starting to kind of

3078
01:54:54,779 --> 01:54:59,698
grow a little bit they've got nice roots

3079
01:54:56,300 --> 01:55:00,869
or about three weeks in I think by the

3080
01:54:59,698 --> 01:55:03,928
fourth week is when we should start

3081
01:55:00,869 --> 01:55:05,069
putting everything into larger pots if

3082
01:55:03,929 --> 01:55:05,940
we leave them in the cups too long

3083
01:55:05,069 --> 01:55:07,738
they're gonna get root bound they're

3084
01:55:05,939 --> 01:55:09,149
gonna start getting Scratchy and also

3085
01:55:07,738 --> 01:55:10,649
when you put them into bigger pots they

3086
01:55:09,149 --> 01:55:12,000
can go a little bit longer without

3087
01:55:10,649 --> 01:55:14,009
needing water so that'll help you out

3088
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,420
too so if you're gonna veg for a couple

3089
01:55:14,010 --> 01:55:18,030
extra weeks and you have times first

3090
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:19,139
time and space bill for bigger pots for

3091
01:55:18,029 --> 01:55:20,578
my example we're just gonna

3092
01:55:19,139 --> 01:55:22,109
you a quick crop and we're gonna use

3093
01:55:20,578 --> 01:55:25,168
three gallon pots and they'll be just

3094
01:55:22,109 --> 01:55:27,058
fine so carefully put everything from

3095
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:29,458
your cups into a three gallon pot or a

3096
01:55:27,059 --> 01:55:31,619
larger pot which every gonna use um and

3097
01:55:29,458 --> 01:55:32,729
I think I've talked about transplanting

3098
01:55:31,618 --> 01:55:34,018
I think I've talked a little bit about

3099
01:55:32,729 --> 01:55:35,489
doing that so if you guys need help

3100
01:55:34,019 --> 01:55:36,689
transplant me let me know and I'll talk

3101
01:55:35,488 --> 01:55:38,728
more about that but I'm pretty sure I've

3102
01:55:36,689 --> 01:55:42,239
covered it so carefully put everything

3103
01:55:38,729 --> 01:55:43,708
into a larger pot and feed them it

3104
01:55:42,238 --> 01:55:45,058
should be about a week for maybe into

3105
01:55:43,708 --> 01:55:46,859
week five by now you guys I hope you

3106
01:55:45,059 --> 01:55:48,090
started doing these indica into pots

3107
01:55:46,859 --> 01:55:50,880
around week four I hope you didn't wait

3108
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:52,679
too long so feed them and you're gonna

3109
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,239
feed them a strong dose of root

3110
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:56,279
inoculant of course we're always gonna

3111
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:58,018
do that through veg right up to kind of

3112
01:55:56,279 --> 01:56:00,599
the start of a flower feed them a veg

3113
01:55:58,019 --> 01:56:02,039
based nutrient I use if I'm using

3114
01:56:00,599 --> 01:56:04,199
bottled nutrients for this I would

3115
01:56:02,038 --> 01:56:07,408
recommend a botanic air pure blend Pro

3116
01:56:04,198 --> 01:56:08,578
soil formula the growth formula they

3117
01:56:07,408 --> 01:56:11,069
don't pay me to say that it's just what

3118
01:56:08,578 --> 01:56:13,498
I use I would use some humic acid in

3119
01:56:11,069 --> 01:56:15,238
there for this grow for my

3120
01:56:13,498 --> 01:56:17,010
recommendation if you're using bottles I

3121
01:56:15,238 --> 01:56:19,678
would say liquid karma from botanic air

3122
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:21,599
I've used a fulvic acid which organic

3123
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:24,418
hair sells a liquid fulvic acid that

3124
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:25,860
works great for this I would use some

3125
01:56:24,418 --> 01:56:27,630
cal-mag at this point you guys you're

3126
01:56:25,859 --> 01:56:29,998
going to start eating some cal-mag in

3127
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:32,429
there a very light dose of cal-mag to

3128
01:56:29,998 --> 01:56:34,408
start because your babies aren't ready

3129
01:56:32,429 --> 01:56:36,118
for it just yet possibly and I don't

3130
01:56:34,408 --> 01:56:37,828
want you to burn them so be careful with

3131
01:56:36,118 --> 01:56:39,839
that cal-mag but it's about to be time I

3132
01:56:37,828 --> 01:56:42,898
would also recommend something to feed

3133
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:44,849
the microbes basic molasses or something

3134
01:56:42,899 --> 01:56:45,630
like Humboldt honey or something like

3135
01:56:44,849 --> 01:56:48,119
that

3136
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:50,550
hi Bree would be good anything like that

3137
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:52,708
with a lot of molasses II type stuff

3138
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:55,199
there so now our plants are in their

3139
01:56:52,708 --> 01:56:56,729
final pots they've been fed these plants

3140
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:58,379
can be topped or super cropped or

3141
01:56:56,729 --> 01:57:00,360
manipulated into a screen of green or

3142
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:01,828
whatever you have planned for them I'll

3143
01:57:00,359 --> 01:57:04,679
just make sure that if you're gonna do

3144
01:57:01,828 --> 01:57:06,418
any topping or pruning do that about ten

3145
01:57:04,679 --> 01:57:08,399
to ten to fourteen days before you start

3146
01:57:06,418 --> 01:57:09,719
flowering the plants your plants need a

3147
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:12,239
little bit of time to recover after

3148
01:57:09,719 --> 01:57:14,069
you've topped up plants our apical

3149
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:15,538
dominate which means they want to top so

3150
01:57:14,069 --> 01:57:17,849
after you've cut the tops the hormones

3151
01:57:15,538 --> 01:57:19,469
have to move around it's got to move

3152
01:57:17,849 --> 01:57:20,699
hormones around you want those hormones

3153
01:57:19,469 --> 01:57:22,649
built up in the tips of your plants

3154
01:57:20,698 --> 01:57:24,478
before you flower to them it's really

3155
01:57:22,649 --> 01:57:25,979
helpful for your plants if you start

3156
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:27,119
topping stuff and pruning things that

3157
01:57:25,979 --> 01:57:28,679
flower right away you're just gonna make

3158
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:29,719
little tiny buds and confuse the [ __ ]

3159
01:57:28,679 --> 01:57:32,690
out of your plant it

3160
01:57:29,719 --> 01:57:35,118
disappointed so now that we are in our

3161
01:57:32,689 --> 01:57:37,399
bigger pots and we fed everything I'm

3162
01:57:35,118 --> 01:57:38,748
gonna say we are in full veg mode we

3163
01:57:37,399 --> 01:57:40,279
have our plants in the finishing pots

3164
01:57:38,748 --> 01:57:41,929
things have been topped in super crops

3165
01:57:40,279 --> 01:57:44,509
we've got our whites on a veg schedule

3166
01:57:41,929 --> 01:57:46,908
of 18 on and six hours off we should be

3167
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:48,619
feeding a solid veg recipe at the start

3168
01:57:46,908 --> 01:57:51,198
of every week and watching for any signs

3169
01:57:48,618 --> 01:57:53,238
of bug problems it'd be a good idea to

3170
01:57:51,198 --> 01:57:54,978
start a bug prevention regimen by now if

3171
01:57:53,238 --> 01:57:56,468
you haven't already started spraying or

3172
01:57:54,979 --> 01:57:59,090
doing something to keep the mites away

3173
01:57:56,469 --> 01:58:01,489
neem oil is a great way to prevent bugs

3174
01:57:59,090 --> 01:58:03,619
while you're in veg but do not ever

3175
01:58:01,488 --> 01:58:05,839
spray a flowering plant with neem oil

3176
01:58:03,618 --> 01:58:07,339
one application of neem oil on a

3177
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:09,828
flowering plant will ruin the entire

3178
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:11,420
thing the flavor will be miserable if

3179
01:58:09,828 --> 01:58:13,788
you make extracts they will taste like

3180
01:58:11,420 --> 01:58:15,590
neem oil I just please don't do that you

3181
01:58:13,788 --> 01:58:18,170
guys don't spray anything on your

3182
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:19,550
flowering plants any bug sprays or

3183
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:20,779
anything on your flowering plants if

3184
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:22,670
you're gonna spray stuff on flowering

3185
01:58:20,779 --> 01:58:32,960
plants make sure it's a well

3186
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:34,578
well-thought-out foliar feed so I said

3187
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:36,139
that we should feed on Monday of every

3188
01:58:34,578 --> 01:58:39,049
week right that's my opinion I like to

3189
01:58:36,139 --> 01:58:40,519
feed on Monday I mix up nutrients I mix

3190
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:43,279
up a nice reservoir of nutrients and

3191
01:58:40,519 --> 01:58:45,559
feed the plants every Monday they get a

3192
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:47,149
nice healthy feed and then usually by

3193
01:58:45,559 --> 01:58:48,650
Wednesday or Thursday they need more

3194
01:58:47,149 --> 01:58:51,078
they need a water

3195
01:58:48,649 --> 01:58:53,299
so I'll just feed them clean pH balanced

3196
01:58:51,078 --> 01:58:55,429
water with no nutrients in it I'll just

3197
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:58,159
feed them that and then on Monday again

3198
01:58:55,429 --> 01:58:59,840
I will give them nutrients and then the

3199
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:01,518
next time that they're thirsty probably

3200
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:04,369
that next Wednesday or Thursday they

3201
01:59:01,519 --> 01:59:06,498
will get a fully organic worm tea that I

3202
01:59:04,368 --> 01:59:08,389
have brewed for like 36 hours

3203
01:59:06,498 --> 01:59:10,819
I'll put worm castings in there and put

3204
01:59:08,389 --> 01:59:13,909
CRO Kashi in there put a little bit of

3205
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:15,590
uh dragonfly earth medicine the lush

3206
01:59:13,908 --> 01:59:19,098
roots in there put a little bit of fish

3207
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:20,389
Hydra sleet put some sea crop and then

3208
01:59:19,099 --> 01:59:22,969
I'll feed my plants that and they get

3209
01:59:20,389 --> 01:59:24,949
fed teas probably twice in veg and

3210
01:59:22,969 --> 01:59:26,448
probably three times during the flower

3211
01:59:24,948 --> 01:59:28,788
phase and I think it makes a huge

3212
01:59:26,448 --> 01:59:30,078
difference because I make a pretty

3213
01:59:28,788 --> 01:59:31,880
awesome tea that Shawn taught me how to

3214
01:59:30,078 --> 01:59:33,679
make I really think it makes a

3215
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:35,809
difference so that's kind of my feeding

3216
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:38,510
idea I don't think I've ever broken down

3217
01:59:35,809 --> 01:59:40,010
my week to week feeding schedule I don't

3218
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:41,389
want to be responsible for your weekly

3219
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:42,090
feeding I kind of want to let you

3220
01:59:41,389 --> 01:59:43,380
experience

3221
01:59:42,090 --> 01:59:45,569
find what works for you but if you've

3222
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:47,640
got questions about specific nutrients

3223
01:59:45,569 --> 01:59:49,619
let me know and I'll do my best to

3224
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:51,780
figure out how to incorporate that into

3225
01:59:49,619 --> 01:59:54,149
your girl for you that's gonna take a

3226
01:59:51,779 --> 01:59:55,500
lot of work so like I've seen earlier we

3227
01:59:54,149 --> 01:59:56,849
can veg as long as we want from my

3228
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:59,100
example we're gonna veg for about 30

3229
01:59:56,850 --> 02:00:00,900
days you can top and manipulate the

3230
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:02,250
plants as much as you want one veg that

3231
02:00:00,899 --> 02:00:02,909
I already read this no but I would stop

3232
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:05,819
talking about

3233
02:00:02,909 --> 02:00:07,559
I would stop talking topping about two

3234
02:00:05,819 --> 02:00:09,149
weeks before flowering my short crops

3235
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:10,470
don't really get much topping and

3236
02:00:09,149 --> 02:00:11,609
pruning you guys if I'm earning a seed

3237
02:00:10,470 --> 02:00:14,610
crop and I want to see what the

3238
02:00:11,609 --> 02:00:16,049
seedlings are I really don't top much I

3239
02:00:14,609 --> 02:00:17,789
take two clones from each plant just

3240
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:20,279
before I flower it I clean up the

3241
02:00:17,789 --> 02:00:22,350
bottoms just a little bit and then once

3242
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:23,819
I flower I clean up the bottoms once I

3243
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:25,620
flower but my small crops really don't

3244
02:00:23,819 --> 02:00:27,599
get much topping or pruning I try to let

3245
02:00:25,619 --> 02:00:28,979
that if the test crops just in and out

3246
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:31,230
quickly so I can see what I'm working

3247
02:00:28,979 --> 02:00:32,669
with because if I've got a bunch of boys

3248
02:00:31,229 --> 02:00:34,379
in there or if I don't see the traits

3249
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:35,640
I'm looking for then I just want to get

3250
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:37,170
that out of there and scrap it as soon

3251
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:42,690
as possible I'm looking for specific

3252
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:44,970
traits at this point basically we need

3253
02:00:42,689 --> 02:00:46,859
to watch for bugs watch for problems and

3254
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:49,350
keep the plants as healthy and happy as

3255
02:00:46,859 --> 02:00:52,049
possible so I suggest checking each

3256
02:00:49,350 --> 02:00:53,579
plant every single day I know that

3257
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:55,170
sounds ridiculous but however many

3258
02:00:53,579 --> 02:00:57,059
plants you've got you should be in there

3259
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:58,529
you should touch every plant every

3260
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:59,910
single day that's how you know you're

3261
02:00:58,529 --> 02:01:02,009
drawing from your heart that's how you

3262
02:00:59,909 --> 02:01:03,750
know you've got solid medicine that

3263
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:05,610
doesn't need to be sprayed with Eagle 20

3264
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:07,229
that's how you know that if you do see a

3265
02:01:05,609 --> 02:01:09,059
problem you'll be on top of it you'll be

3266
02:01:07,229 --> 02:01:10,469
able to cure it you'll be able to solve

3267
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:12,690
the problem before it gets out of

3268
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:15,270
control that's super important being a

3269
02:01:12,689 --> 02:01:18,029
good gardener so I suggest checking each

3270
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:19,770
day and make notes of what you see if

3271
02:01:18,029 --> 02:01:21,539
you see anything that stands out to you

3272
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:23,070
make a note of it if it's good if it's

3273
02:01:21,539 --> 02:01:25,350
bad if it's weird if you're not sure if

3274
02:01:23,069 --> 02:01:29,609
it's new if it's questionable make a

3275
02:01:25,350 --> 02:01:30,960
note and don't forget because I know

3276
02:01:29,609 --> 02:01:32,729
you're gonna say I'll remember ship the

3277
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:34,710
notes are in my head dude where pot

3278
02:01:32,729 --> 02:01:36,299
heads were pot growers we're dabbers

3279
02:01:34,710 --> 02:01:39,569
you're gonna forget you're gonna forget

3280
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,529
something write it down and when maybe

3281
02:01:39,569 --> 02:01:42,420
one day you're gonna want to run a

3282
02:01:40,529 --> 02:01:43,649
business and the guy with the notes will

3283
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:44,819
get the opportunity to run a business

3284
02:01:43,649 --> 02:01:46,199
over the guy with the head full of

3285
02:01:44,819 --> 02:01:47,489
[ __ ] and ideas you've written

3286
02:01:46,199 --> 02:01:48,689
something down that shows you've done

3287
02:01:47,489 --> 02:01:51,090
something the other guy's like I

3288
02:01:48,689 --> 02:01:52,589
remember doing this the people that are

3289
02:01:51,090 --> 02:01:54,090
hiring you to be their master girl right

3290
02:01:52,590 --> 02:01:55,199
their dispensary don't want your hopes

3291
02:01:54,090 --> 02:01:56,760
and dreams in your head

3292
02:01:55,198 --> 02:01:58,678
see it on paper if you take notes you

3293
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:59,909
got something that's documented and now

3294
02:01:58,679 --> 02:02:01,079
that it's legal you don't have to worry

3295
02:01:59,909 --> 02:02:03,059
about it I understand the old-school

3296
02:02:01,079 --> 02:02:05,789
drillers didn't want any notes I get it

3297
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:07,260
but now he can so so set a date for your

3298
02:02:05,789 --> 02:02:09,149
flowering cycle is what I think you

3299
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:10,829
should do decide how long you want to

3300
02:02:09,149 --> 02:02:14,159
veg send a date for your flowering cycle

3301
02:02:10,829 --> 02:02:16,409
and then commit to that and veg for that

3302
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:17,729
long get your plants trimmed up get them

3303
02:02:16,409 --> 02:02:19,198
pruned get them topped if you're gonna

3304
02:02:17,729 --> 02:02:20,939
put them in a screen of green like

3305
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:23,519
Spence taught us about put them in the

3306
02:02:20,939 --> 02:02:24,899
screen of green get them nice and happy

3307
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:28,260
and we'll get them ready for the

3308
02:02:24,899 --> 02:02:31,679
flowering cycle I've gone for 30 minutes

3309
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:33,690
I don't think I can get enough of the

3310
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:36,510
flowering cycle to make it worth your

3311
02:02:33,689 --> 02:02:38,399
listen in to this episode so I think

3312
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:39,810
we're just gonna start wrapping up the

3313
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:41,729
show at 30 minutes you guys really

3314
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:43,260
listen a lot when I put out shorter

3315
02:02:41,729 --> 02:02:45,238
episodes you don't seem to get the

3316
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:46,440
attention deficit disorder so we're just

3317
02:02:45,238 --> 02:02:47,968
gonna do a short episode here I

3318
02:02:46,439 --> 02:02:50,460
appreciate you guys for listening I will

3319
02:02:47,969 --> 02:02:52,439
come back in a week and I will have a

3320
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:55,140
solid lesson about the flowering

3321
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:56,849
schedule for you I hope to get Spence on

3322
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:58,350
an upcoming episode I was talking to

3323
02:02:56,850 --> 02:02:59,940
Sean and he'll be back in the future

3324
02:02:58,350 --> 02:03:01,739
I've got an episode coming up about how

3325
02:02:59,939 --> 02:03:02,698
to improve your garden I've got a lot of

3326
02:03:01,738 --> 02:03:04,198
things planned you guys I'm really

3327
02:03:02,698 --> 02:03:06,238
getting back on my game so I'm getting

3328
02:03:04,198 --> 02:03:07,559
more lessons written down getting more

3329
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:09,479
episodes planned I appreciate you

3330
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:12,050
sticking through my rough patch there

3331
02:03:09,479 --> 02:03:15,149
while I had to do some sloppy episodes

3332
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:16,920
big thanks to everybody who sent me well

3333
02:03:15,149 --> 02:03:18,379
wishes on taking care of my head wishing

3334
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:21,090
me better on my head I feel much better

3335
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:24,260
I'd like to say I'm about I kept sin as

3336
02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:26,550
90% I'm about 85% back I keep noticing

3337
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:27,960
sometimes I'll say the wrong word in a

3338
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:31,110
sentence the other day I told somebody

3339
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:33,630
that I was going to eat this banana and

3340
02:03:31,109 --> 02:03:35,250
I was actually holding a burrito and I

3341
02:03:33,630 --> 02:03:36,900
didn't even realize that I'd I kept

3342
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:38,520
saying banana but it was a burrito and

3343
02:03:36,899 --> 02:03:40,049
they corrected me and I said yeah this

3344
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:42,270
banana is tasty and they're like it's a

3345
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:45,360
[ __ ] burrito dude so I realized I was

3346
02:03:42,270 --> 02:03:48,300
doing that I was describing something

3347
02:03:45,359 --> 02:03:51,988
that was purple and I called it orange

3348
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:53,159
and I know I did that but I don't yeah

3349
02:03:51,988 --> 02:03:54,419
so there's stuff like that that's going

3350
02:03:53,159 --> 02:03:56,579
on in my head that's still a little bit

3351
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:58,020
goofy and sometimes I forget my password

3352
02:03:56,579 --> 02:03:59,819
still and I try to log into my computer

3353
02:03:58,020 --> 02:04:00,960
but I'm getting it back together so I do

3354

appreciate you guys sticking with me

3355
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:03,810

3356
02:04:02,039 --> 02:04:06,510
time but I feel like I'm coming back

you guys a huge apology I know that

3429
02:06:38,359 --> 02:06:42,380
there was an issue with the last episode

3430
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:44,600
I posted the stitcher but it has since

3431
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:46,760
been corrected drop down that music a

3432
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:48,500
little bit I'm gonna repeat that the

3433
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:50,869
last episode I posted the stitcher went

3434
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:52,189
up I went to iTunes it went to stitcher

3435
02:06:50,869 --> 02:06:53,930
I went to the website everything went

3436
02:06:52,189 --> 02:06:55,759
perfectly but for some reason when

3437
02:06:53,930 --> 02:06:58,820
stitcher grabbed it it only took the

3438
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:59,989
first 14 or 15 minutes of it so for the

3439
02:06:58,819 --> 02:07:01,880
first couple of days of the week you

3440
02:06:59,989 --> 02:07:03,739
guys were only able to access a 15

3441
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:05,300
minute episode right when the Gros

3442
02:07:03,739 --> 02:07:06,460
lesson came in everything cut off I

3443
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:08,420
apologize for that

3444
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:10,699
Didrik got it fixed it took him a couple

3445
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:13,100
of days but stitcher did repair that for

3446
02:07:10,699 --> 02:07:14,929
me so a big shout out the stitcher big

3447
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:17,720
thanks to everybody who listened to that

3448
02:07:14,930 --> 02:07:20,329
episode if you guys tried to listen and

3449
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:22,460
gave up because it sucked go back and

3450
02:07:20,329 --> 02:07:24,800
the whole episode is there now it's a 30

3451
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:27,109
something minute episode we cover most

3452
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:29,510
of veg growth so now that that's out of

3453
02:07:27,109 --> 02:07:32,119
the way let's move forward with the show

3454
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:33,650
I received a question that I want to

3455
02:07:32,119 --> 02:07:35,359
answer it'll be real quick somebody

3456
02:07:33,649 --> 02:07:38,960
asked me why do you turn off the lights

3457
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:40,909
during your foliar feeding when I'm

3458
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:43,939
using a bug spray or a foliar feed I

3459
02:07:40,909 --> 02:07:45,769
turn off the lights because when you

3460
02:07:43,939 --> 02:07:47,149
spray the plants with a liquid it makes

3461
02:07:45,770 --> 02:07:47,960
little bubbles on there right and then

3462
02:07:47,149 --> 02:07:51,109
you've got these high-intensity

3463
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:52,819
discharge lights right above them and it

3464
02:07:51,109 --> 02:07:55,219
works the same way as if you took a

3465
02:07:52,819 --> 02:07:57,679
magnifying glass and shone the Sun

3466
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:59,990
through it it makes that little I call

3467
02:07:57,680 --> 02:08:01,970
it a reflector bubble and the magnifying

3468
02:07:59,989 --> 02:08:03,649
glass of the Sun work and it makes that

3469
02:08:01,970 --> 02:08:05,720
little dot on [ __ ] and then it burns it

3470
02:08:03,649 --> 02:08:07,429
it'll create you can catch paper on fire

3471
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:08,780
when I was a kid I remember

3472
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:11,480
ants and [ __ ] with the magnifying glass

3473
02:08:08,779 --> 02:08:13,039
using the Sun the bubble on your plants

3474
02:08:11,479 --> 02:08:16,779
will do the exact same thing will create

3475
02:08:13,039 --> 02:08:16,779
that magnifier bubble the light will hit

3476
02:08:21,609 --> 02:08:26,179
your feet or a bug spray I fully

3477
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:27,710
recommend you turn off the lights it's

3478
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:30,530
ideal to do it right before the lights

3479
02:08:27,710 --> 02:08:32,480
go out if you can but sometimes we have

3480
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:34,639
jobs and prevent us from doing that so

3481
02:08:32,479 --> 02:08:35,599
that is why I turn off the lights when I

3482
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:37,070
follow your feet and that's why I

3483
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:39,770
recommend you turn off the lights when

3484
02:08:37,069 --> 02:08:41,869
you follow your feet or bug spray let's

3485
02:08:39,770 --> 02:08:43,820
see what's going on in my world man I

3486
02:08:41,869 --> 02:08:45,380
was at the spa yesterday I spent a

3487
02:08:43,819 --> 02:08:47,090
couple hours out at the spot dispensary

3488
02:08:45,380 --> 02:08:48,710
in Pueblo West and things are really

3489
02:08:47,090 --> 02:08:51,590
moving forward I should be out there

3490

3491

3492
02:08:54,590 --> 02:09:02,119
need a couple small more we need a few

3493
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:03,410
small steps to get through before I am

3494
02:09:02,119 --> 02:09:04,670

3495
02:09:03,409 --> 02:09:06,680

02:09:20,029 --> 02:09:25,699
like my head is improving if you guys

3506
02:09:22,729 --> 02:09:28,699
follow the show I had a serious

3507
02:09:25,699 --> 02:09:30,470
concussion a few episodes the beginning

3508
02:09:28,699 --> 02:09:31,519
of April mid-april were a little bit I'm

3509
02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:34,460
gonna say there were shitty in my

3510
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:36,080
opinion I know they were not up to the

3511
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:38,359
standard I have created they did not

3512
02:09:36,079 --> 02:09:40,689
follow the format that I've created but

3513
02:09:38,359 --> 02:09:43,009
honestly I was not in my head I was

3514
02:09:40,689 --> 02:09:44,989
recovering from a major head wound but

3515
02:09:43,010 --> 02:09:47,210
the good part is I feel like I'm getting

3516
02:09:44,989 --> 02:09:49,789
my [ __ ] together it's been a week since

3517
02:09:47,210 --> 02:09:51,890
I sat down to record and it came

3518
02:09:49,789 --> 02:09:53,899
together the recording equipment came

3519
02:09:51,890 --> 02:09:56,480
together easily my podcast notes came

3520
02:09:53,899 --> 02:09:58,489
together easily the notes that I wrote

3521
02:09:56,479 --> 02:10:01,399
last week I brushed them up and made a

3522
02:09:58,489 --> 02:10:02,449
lot more sense out of them so the good

3523
02:10:01,399 --> 02:10:03,859
part is I feel like I'm getting back

3524

together I want to thank you guys for

3525

3526
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:09,920

3536
02:10:24,779 --> 02:10:28,590
I appreciate that you guys have no idea

3537

what that means to me I'm getting back

3538
02:10:28,590 --> 02:10:31,650
on my feet I've been on my feet but I'm

3539
02:10:30,510 --> 02:10:35,039
getting my head back in there while I'm

3540
02:10:31,649 --> 02:10:36,779
doing it so let's move on to the guys

3541
02:10:35,039 --> 02:10:38,460
I've written a bunch of stuff and I'm

3542
02:10:36,779 --> 02:10:41,279
gonna try to convince it all into one

3543
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:42,899
lesson for you so I may leave a little

3544
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:44,939
bit out if you have any questions just

3545

3546
02:10:44,939 --> 02:10:49,649
went too fast on alright I'm gonna take

3547
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:52,289
a quick drink and a DAB and we're going

3548
02:10:49,649 --> 02:10:53,489

3549
02:10:52,289 --> 02:10:55,019
I'm taking a DAB make sure you support

3550
02:10:53,489 --> 02:10:56,789
our sponsors the rocky mountain worm

3551
02:10:55,020 --> 02:10:58,710
company if you need organic soil

3552
02:10:56,789 --> 02:11:06,149
amendments or high-quality worm castings

3553
02:10:58,710 --> 02:11:07,590
check out www.sceeto.com today alright

3554
02:11:06,149 --> 02:11:09,719
guys in the last episode I talked a lot

3555
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:11,220
about vegetative growth and we got right

3556
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:12,240
up to the first day of flowering and

3557
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:15,119
that's where I want to start off today

3558
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:16,439
let's start a flowering cycle the first

3559
02:11:15,119 --> 02:11:18,659
let's talk a little bit about the

3560
02:11:16,439 --> 02:11:20,639
flowering period I've alluded that there

3561
02:11:18,659 --> 02:11:21,899
are three trimesters to the flowering

3562
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:24,210
period don't let me explain a little

3563
02:11:21,899 --> 02:11:26,279
what I meant by that for this we're

3564
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:28,800
gonna talk about a nine week plan a nine

3565
02:11:26,279 --> 02:11:30,539
week flowering plant will use grateful

3566
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:32,000
dog as an example cuz it likes to finish

3567
02:11:30,539 --> 02:11:34,500
in about nine weeks so that's perfect

3568
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:37,409
the first trimester is what I would

3569
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:40,470
refer to as the transition phase the

3570
02:11:37,409 --> 02:11:42,659
second trimester is full flower and the

3571
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:44,550
finishing and the third trimester is the

3572
02:11:42,659 --> 02:11:45,960
finishing and ripening phase so I'm

3573
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:47,310
gonna try to talk a little bit about

3574
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:49,619
what the plants want during each

3575
02:11:47,310 --> 02:11:51,420
trimester and I'll do my best to kind of

3576
02:11:49,619 --> 02:11:53,340
break it down week by week for you and

3577
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:55,460
let you know what to feed and what you

3578
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:58,020
can be doing to your plants each week

3579
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:59,609
we'll find like the main important

3580
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:01,320
things to do to your plants each week

3581
02:11:59,609 --> 02:12:02,789
and then I'll give you some ideas that

3582
02:12:01,319 --> 02:12:04,590
will really improve your crops and then

3583
02:12:02,789 --> 02:12:08,939
in a future episode we're gonna focus

3584
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:10,710
all about improving your crops so let's

3585
02:12:08,939 --> 02:12:12,719
get on it let's start a flowering cycle

3586
02:12:10,710 --> 02:12:15,420
today would be day one of week one a

3587
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:16,920
flower so I would start on a Monday

3588
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:18,510
that's just my preference we've talked

3589
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:20,340
about that I would go to that Monday and

3590
02:12:18,510 --> 02:12:22,770
I would say day one a flower a week one

3591
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:24,539
day one then I would go through and mark

3592
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:26,670
that calendar week two week three week

3593
02:12:24,539 --> 02:12:30,630
four week five week six so that it's

3594
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:32,039
easily easily viewable alright so you

3595
02:12:30,630 --> 02:12:33,989
want to set the lights for a twelve

3596
02:12:32,039 --> 02:12:34,439
twelve cycle that means we want the

3597
02:12:33,989 --> 02:12:36,479
lights to be

3598
02:12:34,439 --> 02:12:38,099
on for 12 hours and offer 12 hours of

3599
02:12:36,479 --> 02:12:40,679
uninterrupted darkness every day and

3600
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:42,449
every night we can't have any dark

3601
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:44,340
during the night cycle I can't stress or

3602
02:12:42,448 --> 02:12:45,839
any light during the night cycle I can't

3603
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:47,130
stress how important it is to have total

3604
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:49,860
darkness for the dark period of your

3605
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:51,779
bloom cycle the room needs to be totally

3606
02:12:49,859 --> 02:12:54,420
pitch-black dark if you can see any

3607
02:12:51,779 --> 02:12:56,488
light in there it's too much if you can

3608
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:58,170
stand in the room and put your hand in

3609
02:12:56,488 --> 02:13:00,209
front of your face if you can see your

3610
02:12:58,170 --> 02:13:03,779
hand at all you need more darkness in

3611
02:13:00,210 --> 02:13:06,359
there that's completely important it's

3612
02:13:03,779 --> 02:13:07,738
also let's see where was it's equally

3613
02:13:06,359 --> 02:13:10,019
important not to interrupt the dark

3614
02:13:07,738 --> 02:13:11,729
period interrupting the dark trade will

3615
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:14,010
cause your plants to possibly Herm and

3616
02:13:11,729 --> 02:13:15,809
possibly make seeds your plants are

3617
02:13:14,010 --> 02:13:17,159
asleep you want to let them sleep it

3618
02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:18,920
pisses you off when I wake you up in the

3619
02:13:17,159 --> 02:13:21,329
middle and I'd piss your plants off too

3620
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:23,340
so running a twelve twelve cycle I like

3621
02:13:21,329 --> 02:13:25,380
to keep my metal halide bulbs in for the

3622
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:27,449
first two weeks of flowering for the

3623
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:29,369
first week of flowering alright here we

3624
02:13:27,448 --> 02:13:31,859
go for the first week of flowering I

3625
02:13:29,369 --> 02:13:33,869
would feed my vegetative base nutrients

3626
02:13:31,859 --> 02:13:36,179
and I would start pumping up my P and K

3627
02:13:33,869 --> 02:13:37,590
values okay and I would also keep

3628
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:40,020
focusing on root development a little

3629
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:42,239
bit if I were using bottled nutrients I

3630
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:44,760
would use a little bit of liquid karma

3631
02:13:42,238 --> 02:13:47,339
some silica blast I would use a little

3632
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:49,920
bit of humble honey and some roots zho

3633
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:51,600
or something similar some kind of

3634
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:54,630
similar rooting powder or maybe some

3635
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:57,060
like what was I using before OGT that

3636
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:58,650
works great white shark works anything

3637
02:13:57,060 --> 02:14:00,449
like that would work for you and also

3638
02:13:58,649 --> 02:14:02,159
maybe I would add in some hydrazine I

3639
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:03,750
don't expect to see a whole lot of

3640
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:06,180
action from the plants your first week

3641
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:08,039
of flower this is the start of the

3642
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:10,500
transitional period like I said this is

3643
02:14:08,039 --> 02:14:12,840
transitional phase from vegetable and

3644
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:15,600
then in about six to ten days is where

3645
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:16,770
you're really gonna see your changes so

3646
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:17,969
let me add something here while I'm

3647
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:20,910
thinking about it your plants are gonna

3648
02:14:17,969 --> 02:14:23,039
get fed nutrients on every Monday but

3649
02:14:20,909 --> 02:14:24,750
they're probably gonna get thirsty you

3650
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:27,029
need a drink before the next Monday so

3651
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:30,448
it's probably gonna be Wednesday or

3652
02:14:27,029 --> 02:14:33,769
Thursday but on that day water your

3653
02:14:30,448 --> 02:14:36,269
plants with just clean water pH dat 6.5

3654
02:14:33,770 --> 02:14:37,920
you don't want to feed every day because

3655
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:39,989
in your plants are going to start to get

3656
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:42,929
over fertilized and they are going to

3657
02:14:39,988 --> 02:14:44,609
get what we call nutrient lock out all

3658
02:14:42,929 --> 02:14:46,829
of your bottle nutrients are assault

3659
02:14:44,609 --> 02:14:48,029
based and if we keep feeding these salts

3660
02:14:46,829 --> 02:14:49,979
to our plants

3661
02:14:48,029 --> 02:14:52,109
they get salty and they don't want to

3662
02:14:49,979 --> 02:14:53,669
take up more salts so they simply stop

3663
02:14:52,109 --> 02:14:55,439
taking up nutrients and that's called

3664
02:14:53,670 --> 02:14:57,060
nutrient lockout so we're gonna feed

3665
02:14:55,439 --> 02:15:00,059
clean water every Wednesday or Thursday

3666
02:14:57,060 --> 02:15:02,850
and prevent that nutrient lockout by

3667
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:06,680
giving these girls a fresh drink so

3668
02:15:02,850 --> 02:15:09,780
that's going to put us into week two for

3669
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:11,310
week two I would start feeding my bloom

3670
02:15:09,779 --> 02:15:13,619
base nutrients and I would add some

3671
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:15,180
cal-mag I would add this is if you're

3672
02:15:13,619 --> 02:15:16,559
gonna use bottled nutrients and this is

3673
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:18,270
what I would use if I were using liquid

3674
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:20,370
karma if you're using a different brand

3675
02:15:18,270 --> 02:15:22,140
all of these products are easily

3676
02:15:20,369 --> 02:15:24,090
replaceable just look at your feet chart

3677
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:25,730
and look at your the other brand and

3678
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:30,029
replace the bottles it'll be that easy

3679
02:15:25,729 --> 02:15:32,309
so for week two I would do some cal mags

3680
02:15:30,029 --> 02:15:33,809
some liquid karma silica blast and I

3681
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:36,060
would add a little bit of cplex

3682
02:15:33,810 --> 02:15:37,650
a week to is where you really need to

3683
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:38,940
start paying attention for mail plants

3684
02:15:37,649 --> 02:15:41,729
if you started from seeds you're gonna

3685
02:15:38,939 --> 02:15:43,079
start seeing little ball sacks develop

3686
02:15:41,729 --> 02:15:45,299
if you've got males in there get them

3687
02:15:43,079 --> 02:15:46,920
out in week two you should start seeing

3688
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:48,480
pre flowers and the plants are starting

3689
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:50,430
to stretch by the end of this week you

3690
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:52,439
should have identified your males and

3691
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:54,840
isolated them if you don't plan on

3692
02:15:52,439 --> 02:15:57,210
breeding definitely get those males out

3693
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:58,800
of there cut them down if you put them

3694
02:15:57,210 --> 02:16:00,210
in the garage they may keep going if you

3695
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,130
put them somewhere they may keep going

3696
02:16:00,210 --> 02:16:04,529
and make pollen kill them cut them down

3697
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:05,940
kill them unless you plan on breeding

3698
02:16:04,529 --> 02:16:06,929
and if you plan on breeding then I don't

3699
02:16:05,939 --> 02:16:09,089
need to tell you what to do with males

3700
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:10,110
you've already got that figured out so

3701
02:16:09,090 --> 02:16:11,880
for week two they're pretty much just

3702
02:16:10,109 --> 02:16:14,339
gonna grow you're gonna start seeing

3703
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:16,710
flowering set flower sets start to

3704
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:18,180
develop you'll start to see the sex if

3705
02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:19,500
you're using feminized seeds still pay

3706
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:21,659
attention to the sex you may get some

3707
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:22,949
piranha hermaphrodites some [ __ ] could

3708
02:16:21,659 --> 02:16:25,019
have gone wrong you may have gotten the

3709
02:16:22,949 --> 02:16:28,139
wrong seeds you never know pay attention

3710
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:29,880
don't take that feminized label as the

3711
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:31,940
complete this will be a perfect female

3712
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:35,159
plant that could not be the case

3713
02:16:31,939 --> 02:16:36,659
alright so week three week three is a

3714
02:16:35,159 --> 02:16:39,030
busy week this is where we really start

3715
02:16:36,659 --> 02:16:42,659
getting busy you should have identified

3716
02:16:39,030 --> 02:16:45,210
your males by now you should have pulled

3717
02:16:42,659 --> 02:16:46,829
them hopefully if you had clones of

3718
02:16:45,209 --> 02:16:49,739
those you tossed the clones of the males

3719
02:16:46,829 --> 02:16:50,969
also so if you don't have nice bud sites

3720
02:16:49,739 --> 02:16:52,649
developing by the beginning of week

3721
02:16:50,969 --> 02:16:55,559
three you may have a light leak or

3722
02:16:52,649 --> 02:16:57,119
another issue during your dark period if

3723
02:16:55,559 --> 02:16:59,850
you're not starting to see little

3724
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:01,470
dandelion looking bud sides by now go in

3725
02:16:59,850 --> 02:17:01,889
the room at night and make sure you're

3726
02:17:01,469 --> 02:17:03,420
not going

3727
02:17:01,888 --> 02:17:05,068
a light leak a small light leak will

3728
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:07,949
prevent your frontier plants from going

3729
02:17:05,068 --> 02:17:10,829
into flower so for week three I would

3730
02:17:07,949 --> 02:17:13,469
feed my bloom base nutrients I would

3731
02:17:10,829 --> 02:17:16,109
feed cal-mag I would introduce full vex

3732
02:17:13,468 --> 02:17:20,188
I believe liquid karma I would use hydro

3733
02:17:16,109 --> 02:17:22,949
Plex see Plex silica blast humble honey

3734
02:17:20,189 --> 02:17:24,929
and hydros I'm this week this will be

3735
02:17:22,949 --> 02:17:26,790
the basic recipe through flowering - the

3736
02:17:24,929 --> 02:17:29,068
hydros I'm my only hydros I'm every

3737
02:17:26,790 --> 02:17:31,319
other feed I do add a few other things

3738
02:17:29,068 --> 02:17:32,638
to my personal mix but this will get you

3739
02:17:31,318 --> 02:17:34,528
guys through flowering I don't want to

3740
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:35,728
get too crazy and have you buying a

3741
02:17:34,529 --> 02:17:37,889
whole bunch of things when you're not

3742
02:17:35,728 --> 02:17:40,260
ready for that so I did get this mix

3743
02:17:37,888 --> 02:17:42,539
from the botanic air website if you need

3744
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:44,519
help mixing up a great botanical recipe

3745
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:47,399
just go to the botanic air website go to

3746
02:17:44,519 --> 02:17:48,870
the nutrient calculator basically

3747
02:17:47,398 --> 02:17:50,189
filling it and asks how many weeks you

3748
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:52,559
want to veg how many weeks you want to

3749
02:17:50,189 --> 02:17:54,148
flower it asks you which bottles of

3750
02:17:52,558 --> 02:17:57,000
nutrients you've got you click on those

3751
02:17:54,148 --> 02:17:59,358
and it'll tell you what to feed I would

3752
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:02,129
recommend reducing it just a little bit

3753
02:17:59,359 --> 02:18:02,880
feed your plants a reduced mix and see

3754
02:18:02,129 --> 02:18:04,799
how they react

3755
02:18:02,879 --> 02:18:06,299
you can always feed more but you can't

3756
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:10,049
unfilled your plants once they've burned

3757
02:18:06,299 --> 02:18:11,759
themselves so don't overdo it they do I

3758
02:18:10,049 --> 02:18:13,858
like botanic air I like the company but

3759
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:15,630
they are a company they need you to buy

3760
02:18:13,859 --> 02:18:18,389
more so they kind of tell you to use a

3761
02:18:15,629 --> 02:18:19,348
little bit extra as my opinion the more

3762
02:18:18,388 --> 02:18:21,478
you use the sooner you got to buy

3763
02:18:19,349 --> 02:18:24,840
another bottle anyway let's talk more

3764
02:18:21,478 --> 02:18:26,039
about week 3 um yeah you can go get that

3765
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:27,299
on the botanic air website is where I

3766
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:28,859
left off right alright if you're using a

3767
02:18:27,299 --> 02:18:31,308
different brand they do have a different

3768
02:18:28,859 --> 02:18:33,359
feeding chart online for you to follow

3769
02:18:31,308 --> 02:18:35,068
almost all the popular brands have a

3770
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:36,630
feeding chart right now and you can

3771
02:18:35,068 --> 02:18:39,299
easily like i said you can easily swap

3772
02:18:36,629 --> 02:18:40,858
out bottle for bottle if you know if you

3773
02:18:39,299 --> 02:18:43,049
just read like I said liquid caramel

3774
02:18:40,859 --> 02:18:44,550
read the bottle see what's in there look

3775
02:18:43,049 --> 02:18:46,858
at whatever brand you're using and

3776
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:49,138
there's the equivalent for your brand is

3777
02:18:46,859 --> 02:18:50,488
there it's all basically the same [ __ ] I

3778
02:18:49,138 --> 02:18:52,029
just prefer botanic air if I'm going

3779
02:18:50,488 --> 02:18:54,010
bottled news

3780
02:18:52,030 --> 02:18:56,100
all right so I also like to add a nice

3781
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:58,239
dose of carbs and sugars at week three

3782
02:18:56,100 --> 02:19:00,430
we're going to start seeing resin

3783
02:18:58,239 --> 02:19:02,709
production around week mid week three

3784
02:19:00,430 --> 02:19:04,239
early week four you'll very little resin

3785
02:19:02,709 --> 02:19:05,709
production but it will start and why not

3786
02:19:04,239 --> 02:19:07,449
give it some carbs and sugars to start

3787
02:19:05,709 --> 02:19:09,639
contributing to that that's my opinion I

3788
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:11,770
also think the carbs and sugars keep the

3789
02:19:09,639 --> 02:19:14,289
mykos in your root zone living and

3790
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:16,810
healthy and happy so that is always a

3791
02:19:14,290 --> 02:19:18,220
good idea to add those guys so in Week

3792
02:19:16,809 --> 02:19:19,569
three we should really see both sites of

3793
02:19:18,219 --> 02:19:21,939
developing this is a good time to start

3794
02:19:19,569 --> 02:19:23,440
lolli popping your plants what that

3795
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:25,750
means is kind of cleaning up the bottom

3796
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:26,829
little mini buds and the sucker branches

3797
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:29,079
that aren't gonna get enough light to

3798
02:19:26,829 --> 02:19:30,789
become viable buds just get in there and

3799
02:19:29,079 --> 02:19:34,059
clean that [ __ ] right out don't be

3800
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:36,190
afraid we'll do a whole lesson on Wally

3801
02:19:34,059 --> 02:19:37,479
poppin if we haven't already you want to

3802
02:19:36,190 --> 02:19:39,310
get in there the lights only gonna

3803
02:19:37,479 --> 02:19:41,619
penetrate your canopy about eighteen to

3804
02:19:39,309 --> 02:19:43,299
twenty maybe twenty four inches if

3805
02:19:41,620 --> 02:19:45,070
you're using regular thousand watt bulbs

3806
02:19:43,299 --> 02:19:47,199
if you're using lower wattage you've got

3807
02:19:45,069 --> 02:19:48,549
even less penetration so you're gonna

3808
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:49,811
want to get in there if your plants

3809
02:19:48,549 --> 02:19:51,879
three foot tall you don't need a whole

3810
02:19:49,810 --> 02:19:53,590
three foot stock you want to kind of

3811
02:19:51,879 --> 02:19:55,479
clean off the bottom twelve inches or so

3812
02:19:53,590 --> 02:19:57,549
and that gives you more airflow down

3813
02:19:55,479 --> 02:19:59,020
there those buds that develop down there

3814
02:19:57,549 --> 02:20:00,699
are just gonna be wispy [ __ ] anyway

3815
02:19:59,021 --> 02:20:02,860
unless you're gonna make hash with it

3816
02:20:00,700 --> 02:20:04,000
clean that up send all that energy up to

3817
02:20:02,860 --> 02:20:05,380
the top of the plant because you don't

3818
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:13,060
always try them time trimming that

3819
02:20:05,379 --> 02:20:14,890
bottom [ __ ] anyway bottoms also I would

3820
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:16,690
recommend switching for a metal halide

3821
02:20:14,890 --> 02:20:18,819
bulbs to high pressure sodium bulbs at

3822
02:20:16,690 --> 02:20:21,880
the start of week three week three is

3823
02:20:18,819 --> 02:20:24,610
the last week of the first trimester and

3824
02:20:21,879 --> 02:20:27,250
it's the last week of the transition and

3825
02:20:24,610 --> 02:20:29,021
stretching phase so after this week your

3826
02:20:27,250 --> 02:20:31,060
plants will quit stretching so much week

3827
02:20:29,021 --> 02:20:32,980
three is really the super stretch and

3828
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:34,590
then week four they'll quit stretching

3829
02:20:32,979 --> 02:20:37,720
and start working more on buds for you

3830
02:20:34,590 --> 02:20:39,011
so in week 3 you want a lollipop and you

3831
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:40,869
want to change to your high pressure

3832
02:20:39,011 --> 02:20:43,210
sodium bulbs are your main goals for

3833
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:45,190
week three guys I know I'm going kind of

3834
02:20:43,209 --> 02:20:48,129
fast but we got nine weeks to cover here

3835
02:20:45,190 --> 02:20:50,300
and I'm only to week four and we're 15

3836
02:20:48,129 --> 02:20:52,310
minutes in already so

3837
02:20:50,299 --> 02:20:54,229
I'll week four I'm gonna feed a very

3838
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:56,629
similar mix than I would in week three

3839
02:20:54,229 --> 02:20:59,329
ah week four is the end of the stretch

3840
02:20:56,629 --> 02:21:00,829
phase and the start of actual bud growth

3841
02:20:59,329 --> 02:21:02,239
you'll really start to see buds

3842
02:21:00,829 --> 02:21:03,709
developing by now and if you don't

3843
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:05,060
you've got a problem we need to get in

3844
02:21:03,709 --> 02:21:06,619
there and make sure you've got darkness

3845
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:10,431
make sure you don't have some shitty

3846
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:12,021
plants so week four is another week to

3847
02:21:10,431 --> 02:21:13,521
lollipop you can definitely get in there

3848
02:21:12,021 --> 02:21:15,050
and lollipop a little bit more i just

3849
02:21:13,521 --> 02:21:16,550
use my thumbnail I don't trim my

3850
02:21:15,049 --> 02:21:17,840
thumbnail all the way down I just use

3851
02:21:16,549 --> 02:21:20,479
that to pick off those little sucker

3852
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:22,010
buds collect them up put them in a

3853
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:23,750
little trash can and toss them those are

3854
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:28,130
put in the compost pile if you're doing

3855
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:30,110
that all that energy could go up to the

3856
02:21:28,129 --> 02:21:31,489
top of the plant if you guys are growing

3857
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:34,670
for just - you could do whatever you

3858
02:21:31,489 --> 02:21:36,260
want with that I get it so now it's also

3859
02:21:34,670 --> 02:21:38,299
a good time to start adding stakes or

3860
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:40,101
some sort of supports to the branches

3861
02:21:38,299 --> 02:21:42,379
cuz we're gonna get some hefty buds and

3862
02:21:40,101 --> 02:21:44,060
once we get into week five and six we're

3863
02:21:42,379 --> 02:21:46,549
really gonna need stakes to support

3864
02:21:44,060 --> 02:21:48,351
everything but by week five and six it's

3865
02:21:46,549 --> 02:21:50,659
such a [ __ ] to maneuver those plants

3866
02:21:48,351 --> 02:21:51,829
your branches got long sticky colas on

3867
02:21:50,659 --> 02:21:53,780
there and you don't want to be playing

3868
02:21:51,829 --> 02:21:55,010
with the resin getting the resin all

3869
02:21:53,780 --> 02:21:56,510
over your clothes you want to leave that

3870
02:21:55,010 --> 02:22:00,351
on the plants so get in there about week

3871
02:21:56,510 --> 02:22:01,970
four and I like to put a stake to

3872
02:22:00,351 --> 02:22:04,670
support the middle Cola because I know

3873
02:22:01,970 --> 02:22:06,709
I'm gonna have a big huge fat cola then

3874
02:22:04,670 --> 02:22:09,200
I like to put about four maybe six and

3875
02:22:06,709 --> 02:22:10,729
sticks around the pot because I'm gonna

3876
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:13,370
get some big colas and I use those

3877
02:22:10,729 --> 02:22:16,100
sticks to strap up my major colas just

3878
02:22:13,370 --> 02:22:17,990
right to the stick I do it early because

3879
02:22:16,101 --> 02:22:19,431
like I'm saying in week five and six I'm

3880
02:22:17,989 --> 02:22:21,021
gonna have some buds going on that I

3881
02:22:19,431 --> 02:22:22,280
don't want to have to mess with so much

3882
02:22:21,021 --> 02:22:24,200
and if I got them all strapped up

3883
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:26,210
already I don't have to worry about it

3884
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:29,000
what I'm working with soil plants I

3885
02:22:26,209 --> 02:22:31,850
usually don't use a trellis or a screen

3886
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,409
or anything but at the dispensary where

3887
02:22:31,851 --> 02:22:35,900
I'm running the big grow we're

3888
02:22:33,409 --> 02:22:37,549
definitely using a trellis and if you're

3889
02:22:35,899 --> 02:22:39,799
gonna trellis the plants you need to get

3890
02:22:37,549 --> 02:22:40,909
that in there during your veg cycle

3891
02:22:39,799 --> 02:22:43,399
that's why when I was doing the veg

3892
02:22:40,909 --> 02:22:45,110
lesson I mentioned that this is the week

3893
02:22:43,399 --> 02:22:47,149
to do any type of trellising and [ __ ]

3894
02:22:45,110 --> 02:22:48,440
like that that'll have to happen in bed

3895
02:22:47,149 --> 02:22:50,629
you guys because those plants are gonna

3896
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:52,010
grow up into that trellis and you don't

3897
02:22:50,629 --> 02:22:54,079
want to be bending them and folding them

3898
02:22:52,010 --> 02:22:55,579
and manipulating them in Flour so you

3899
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:57,140
have to be prepared for that that's why

3900
02:22:55,579 --> 02:22:58,610
we're making a schedule now before we

3901
02:22:57,140 --> 02:23:00,170
put these plants in the dirt or in the

3902
02:22:58,610 --> 02:23:02,659
rockwool cubes

3903
02:23:00,170 --> 02:23:04,818
so get your stakes up you guys water

3904
02:23:02,658 --> 02:23:06,260
healthy get your stakes up more lollipop

3905
02:23:04,818 --> 02:23:08,809
not s'what you're doing for a week for

3906
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:10,639
let's transition into week five now this

3907
02:23:08,809 --> 02:23:12,769
is when the fun starts you guys the

3908
02:23:10,639 --> 02:23:15,019
plants start getting photogenic the buds

3909
02:23:12,770 --> 02:23:16,550
start getting chunky since we're gettin

3910
02:23:15,020 --> 02:23:18,500
chunky buds it's a good time to stop

3911
02:23:16,549 --> 02:23:20,179
fooling your feeding I don't talk a lot

3912
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:22,850
about foliar feeding I will in the

3913
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:24,680
future foliar feeding can lead to a lot

3914
02:23:22,850 --> 02:23:26,300
of problems if it's done incorrectly or

3915
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:28,550
at the wrong time so I haven't

3916
02:23:26,299 --> 02:23:29,719
introduced that yet but if you have gone

3917
02:23:28,549 --> 02:23:31,579
on your own and started full of your

3918
02:23:29,719 --> 02:23:33,670
feeding week five is what I would

3919
02:23:31,579 --> 02:23:35,840
recommend you quit

3920
02:23:33,670 --> 02:23:37,969
it's also important to pay attention to

3921
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:39,920
your humidity in week 5 high humidity

3922
02:23:37,969 --> 02:23:42,379
and big buds can be a great way to

3923
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:44,360
create powdery mildew or other mold

3924
02:23:42,379 --> 02:23:45,859
related problems I'm sure you guys that

3925
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:48,200
listen to the podcast have heard me talk

3926
02:23:45,860 --> 02:23:48,829
about growing in a new room I was in a

3927
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:53,329
basement

3928
02:23:48,829 --> 02:23:55,309
I had a exterior wall corner that got

3929
02:23:53,329 --> 02:23:57,409
really cold in that corner pocket right

3930
02:23:55,309 --> 02:23:59,449
there had a lot of cold air and I had a

3931
02:23:57,409 --> 02:24:01,549
5 ounce white rhino plant that I cut

3932
02:23:59,450 --> 02:24:03,350
down and discovered powdery mildew on

3933
02:24:01,549 --> 02:24:06,979
one butt of it as I was cutting it down

3934
02:24:03,350 --> 02:24:09,319
and I threw the entire plant away about

3935
02:24:06,979 --> 02:24:11,029
probably 5 ounces worth a good cannabis

3936
02:24:09,319 --> 02:24:13,549
somewhere between 4 and 6 ounces is what

3937
02:24:11,030 --> 02:24:15,350
those plants were averaging so 5 ounces

3938
02:24:13,549 --> 02:24:18,619
that my patients did not get to enjoy

3939
02:24:15,350 --> 02:24:20,149
because I let it get powdery mildew so

3940
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:22,160
pay attention to the room don't let your

3941
02:24:20,149 --> 02:24:23,750
room get too humid my problem was that

3942
02:24:22,159 --> 02:24:26,090
it was cold and I was letting cold air

3943
02:24:23,750 --> 02:24:28,760
mix with the warm air and that created

3944
02:24:26,090 --> 02:24:30,020
mildew in my room but I learned from it

3945
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:32,659
I learned a whole lot that she will

3946
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:34,370
never happen to me again hey guys if it

3947
02:24:32,659 --> 02:24:35,719
happens to you don't don't feel bad

3948
02:24:34,370 --> 02:24:37,070
shit's gonna happen you just have to

3949
02:24:35,719 --> 02:24:40,429
learn from it it's how you deal with it

3950
02:24:37,069 --> 02:24:41,869
is what makes you the grower so do your

3951
02:24:40,430 --> 02:24:43,010
best to get the humidity under control

3952
02:24:41,870 --> 02:24:44,570
you don't want too much humidity in

3953
02:24:43,010 --> 02:24:47,540
there you do not want to start getting

3954
02:24:44,569 --> 02:24:49,309
mildew um for a week 5 I would recommend

3955
02:24:47,540 --> 02:24:50,960
getting your humidity right around fifty

3956
02:24:49,309 --> 02:24:53,659
percent if you can get it to 40 there's

3957
02:24:50,959 --> 02:24:54,799
nothing wrong with that you don't want

3958
02:24:53,659 --> 02:24:56,930
it too high that's when you're gonna get

3959
02:24:54,799 --> 02:24:58,399
problems too low of humidity your rooms

3960
02:24:56,930 --> 02:25:00,530
gonna dry up kind of quickly and the

3961
02:24:58,399 --> 02:25:03,469
buds don't get as sticky I don't think

3962
02:25:00,530 --> 02:25:04,550
but if you have the option or if you're

3963
02:25:03,469 --> 02:25:06,409
stuck with one if you have to go to

3964
02:25:04,549 --> 02:25:08,840
higher to low definitely go to low of

3965
02:25:06,409 --> 02:25:10,190
humidity so let's see we talked about

3966
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:12,559
getting rid of the humidity I'm reading

3967
02:25:10,190 --> 02:25:14,270
notes as I do this oh this is where I

3968
02:25:12,559 --> 02:25:15,739
would stop lollipop you guys week five

3969
02:25:14,270 --> 02:25:17,600
don't wall-e pop anymore

3970
02:25:15,739 --> 02:25:18,920
you can if he wants you but you should

3971
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:20,149
have gotten all that taken care of by

3972
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:23,239
now and you're just gonna kind of shock

3973
02:25:20,149 --> 02:25:24,739
the plan if you keep doing it you may if

3974
02:25:23,239 --> 02:25:26,180
you keep lolli popping and [ __ ] with

3975
02:25:24,739 --> 02:25:27,949
the plant this far and you may cause it

3976
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:29,540
to stress out in her just depends on

3977
02:25:27,950 --> 02:25:32,500
what other stress you're giving to the

3978
02:25:29,540 --> 02:25:35,180
plant so you should have a room full of

3979
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:36,469
sexy chunky buds by now they're gonna

3980
02:25:35,180 --> 02:25:39,920
start falling over and needing attention

3981
02:25:36,469 --> 02:25:41,119
so hopefully you've got plenty of sticks

3982
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:43,579
in there you're in there paying

3983
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:44,540
attention every day you're gonna go in

3984
02:25:43,579 --> 02:25:45,770
there one day and you're gonna find a

3985
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:47,150
bud that you didn't notice and it's

3986
02:25:45,770 --> 02:25:49,370
gonna be straight sideways

3987
02:25:47,149 --> 02:25:51,199
like it's ready to break don't panic

3988
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:53,540
just get in there and support it give it

3989
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:55,400
some support that shit's gonna happen to

3990
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:57,170
you and you're gonna learn all these

3991
02:25:55,399 --> 02:25:58,399
things over a couple of grows of what to

3992
02:25:57,170 --> 02:26:00,800
look for and you'll learn to stop

3993
02:25:58,399 --> 02:26:01,399
panicking when you see a problem guys

3994
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:03,020
don't panic

3995
02:26:01,399 --> 02:26:04,789
that's I know I keep saying that but if

3996
02:26:03,021 --> 02:26:05,210
you freak out you're just gonna make it

3997
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:06,351
worse

3998
02:26:05,209 --> 02:26:09,050
when you see a problem in the grow room

3999
02:26:06,351 --> 02:26:11,000
just take a minute it's a plant we can

4000
02:26:09,050 --> 02:26:13,569
fix it hopefully if not we'll just make

4001
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:15,950
be HOF it you're gonna be okay

4002
02:26:13,569 --> 02:26:18,110
so for week five I like to add a really

4003
02:26:15,950 --> 02:26:19,790
strong dose of sugars and carbs one of

4004
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:22,819
my favorite bottled products is humble

4005
02:26:19,790 --> 02:26:25,190
honey I use that at week three but I use

4006
02:26:22,819 --> 02:26:28,520
a nice fat dose of it again at week five

4007
02:26:25,190 --> 02:26:29,931
so for week five you want to make sure

4008
02:26:28,521 --> 02:26:31,370
you've got your supports in place if you

4009
02:26:29,931 --> 02:26:33,471
haven't done in week four you may need

4010
02:26:31,370 --> 02:26:35,780
to add a few more sticks in place for

4011
02:26:33,470 --> 02:26:38,750
week five to get those bigger buds up in

4012
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:40,489
place what I do I put a I think it's a

4013
02:26:38,750 --> 02:26:42,261
six foot tall bamboo sticks I grow big

4014
02:26:40,489 --> 02:26:44,271
plants you guys I put a six-foot tall

4015
02:26:42,261 --> 02:26:45,290
bamboo stick toward the outer edge of

4016
02:26:44,271 --> 02:26:47,420
the plant because I don't want to

4017
02:26:45,290 --> 02:26:51,290
disrupt too much of the root I just

4018
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:53,060
shove it right into there then I grab

4019
02:26:51,290 --> 02:26:54,860
the bud that needs some support and I

4020
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:56,420
use I've used several different things

4021
02:26:54,860 --> 02:26:57,650
but right now I'm using they call them

4022
02:26:56,420 --> 02:27:00,079
fuzzy sticks

4023
02:26:57,649 --> 02:27:01,399
I got a Hobby Lobby had a whole bunch

4024
02:27:00,079 --> 02:27:03,950
for really cheap so I bought a [ __ ] ton

4025
02:27:01,399 --> 02:27:06,020
of them it's kind of like a it's a pipe

4026
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:07,490
cleaner essentially it's like a really

4027
02:27:06,021 --> 02:27:09,500
long bread tie that you can handle

4028
02:27:07,489 --> 02:27:11,780
better so I just take that and I wrap

4029
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:13,940
that right around the stalk of the bud

4030
02:27:11,780 --> 02:27:15,409
that's gonna fall over and maybe maybe

4031
02:27:13,940 --> 02:27:16,761
I'll do part of the bud just depends on

4032
02:27:15,409 --> 02:27:18,409
how I have you the bud is if I feel like

4033
02:27:16,761 --> 02:27:19,761
it'll break the stick but then I take

4034
02:27:18,409 --> 02:27:22,011
that just wrap it around the bud or the

4035
02:27:19,761 --> 02:27:23,420
stalk and wrap that around the stick

4036
02:27:22,011 --> 02:27:24,681
itself so that it's just strapped right

4037
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:27,380
up to it like you got a broken finger

4038
02:27:24,681 --> 02:27:29,030
just give that sucker some support he's

4039
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:31,520
doing it fallin over I'm breaking these

4040
02:27:29,030 --> 02:27:32,690
your whole goal maybe if you tip it a

4041
02:27:31,521 --> 02:27:34,190
little bit if it's at an angle it's a

4042
02:27:32,690 --> 02:27:36,681
good idea because then you can expose

4043
02:27:34,190 --> 02:27:38,569
more of that bud to the white instead of

4044
02:27:36,681 --> 02:27:40,131
just having it completely up and down if

4045
02:27:38,569 --> 02:27:41,931
you tip it you get a little more surface

4046
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:45,350
area for that light to hit which will

4047
02:27:41,931 --> 02:27:47,301
increase your harvests so week five you

4048
02:27:45,351 --> 02:27:49,489
want to work on your supports you want

4049
02:27:47,300 --> 02:27:51,260
to feed some sugars and carbs you want

4050
02:27:49,489 --> 02:27:53,750
to monitor your humidity get it around

4051
02:27:51,261 --> 02:27:55,881
50 to 40% and keep it there because

4052
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:57,739
you're gonna start getting chunkier buds

4053
02:27:55,880 --> 02:27:59,670
and you don't need mildew and you're

4054
02:27:57,739 --> 02:28:00,750
gonna stop foliar feeding all right

4055
02:27:59,670 --> 02:28:03,290
so that's what's gonna happen in week

4056
02:28:00,750 --> 02:28:05,790
five that's gonna move us into week six

4057
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:07,620
in week six I would feed a very similar

4058
02:28:05,790 --> 02:28:09,689
recipe as I did in week five I'd use

4059
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:10,770
high amounts of P and K and lots of

4060
02:28:09,689 --> 02:28:13,109
sugars and carbs

4061
02:28:10,770 --> 02:28:15,029
I would reduce my base nutrients and

4062
02:28:13,109 --> 02:28:16,100
focus on resin production and healthy

4063
02:28:15,029 --> 02:28:19,050
plants

4064
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:20,939
week six will be our last full feeding

4065
02:28:19,049 --> 02:28:22,438
hour but should be chunky and the resin

4066
02:28:20,939 --> 02:28:24,840
should be starting to cover the buds and

4067
02:28:22,439 --> 02:28:26,639
the small leaves after growing a strain

4068
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:28,408
that Purple's up now is a good time to

4069
02:28:26,639 --> 02:28:31,260
lower the temps a few degrees during the

4070
02:28:28,408 --> 02:28:34,680
night cycles I try to keep my grow rooms

4071
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:36,840
about 77 or 74 to 77 degrees during the

4072
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:39,329
light period during the dark period I

4073
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:42,148
try to get it down to about 68 69

4074
02:28:39,329 --> 02:28:43,770
degrees at this point in week 6 if I'm

4075
02:28:42,148 --> 02:28:45,719
working with something that will purple

4076
02:28:43,770 --> 02:28:48,180
up a little bit like the Kalonji Kush or

4077
02:28:45,719 --> 02:28:50,369
the flow or the ghost doji or The

4078
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:53,189
Grateful dog I would drop the temps down

4079
02:28:50,370 --> 02:28:55,829
just a few more to like 65 degrees maybe

4080
02:28:53,189 --> 02:28:57,988
67 and if you get to that 65 at night

4081
02:28:55,829 --> 02:28:59,488
you'll see it in at night or to those

4082
02:28:57,988 --> 02:29:01,579
plants will start to purple up the

4083
02:28:59,488 --> 02:29:05,068
leaves will turn purple for you

4084
02:29:01,579 --> 02:29:07,289
higher CBD plants I think like more cold

4085
02:29:05,068 --> 02:29:09,930
but that's just my experience with the

4086
02:29:07,290 --> 02:29:12,300
Tora Bora and the night nurse you may

4087
02:29:09,930 --> 02:29:14,609
have a totally different plant so don't

4088
02:29:12,299 --> 02:29:16,920
take that as rule that's just my

4089
02:29:14,609 --> 02:29:18,988
experience so you might want to lower

4090
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:20,670
the tips do stal ittle bit if you're

4091
02:29:18,988 --> 02:29:23,850
trying to pull out the purples if you

4092
02:29:20,670 --> 02:29:26,040
have more sativa dominant plants this

4093
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:27,390
would probably piss off the Capleton the

4094
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:29,399
white widow would not like it

4095
02:29:27,389 --> 02:29:32,028
lemon Geoffrey would not like that don't

4096
02:29:29,398 --> 02:29:34,379
put those in the cold but cushy plants

4097
02:29:32,029 --> 02:29:35,850
indica dominant plants give him a little

4098
02:29:34,379 --> 02:29:38,908
bit of cold and they'll purple up for

4099
02:29:35,850 --> 02:29:40,680
you about week six you're gonna have to

4100
02:29:38,908 --> 02:29:42,658
use more air conditioning so that may

4101
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:44,488
cost you a little bit but I think it's

4102
02:29:42,658 --> 02:29:45,658
worth it for the plant that enjoys that

4103
02:29:44,488 --> 02:29:47,430
so we accept a great week for

4104
02:29:45,658 --> 02:29:49,680
photography you guys you got big chunky

4105
02:29:47,430 --> 02:29:52,939
buds this is however your last feeding

4106
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:54,809
so whatever your plants are lacking or

4107
02:29:52,939 --> 02:29:56,550
whatever you haven't gotten in there

4108
02:29:54,809 --> 02:29:58,709
this is probably your last chance to do

4109
02:29:56,549 --> 02:30:00,090
it we are going to feed on week seven

4110
02:29:58,709 --> 02:30:01,648
but we're not going to feed the entire

4111
02:30:00,090 --> 02:30:03,779
program we're just gonna give a little

4112
02:30:01,648 --> 02:30:04,430
bit of stuff to keep it alive and happy

4113
02:30:03,779 --> 02:30:08,270
and healthy

4114
02:30:04,430 --> 02:30:11,479
so week six basically work on a good

4115
02:30:08,270 --> 02:30:12,890
feeding lower your tips if you want make

4116
02:30:11,478 --> 02:30:14,538
sure you've got everything supported and

4117
02:30:12,889 --> 02:30:16,129
staked up make sure nothing falls over

4118
02:30:14,539 --> 02:30:17,899
keep going through every single week you

4119
02:30:16,129 --> 02:30:20,688
guys and check for Herms check for mails

4120
02:30:17,898 --> 02:30:23,328
check for issues I should say this also

4121
02:30:20,689 --> 02:30:25,789
every day if you can do it every day go

4122
02:30:23,328 --> 02:30:27,708
in your garden and grab each plant and

4123
02:30:25,789 --> 02:30:29,270
just grab one leaf and flip it upside

4124
02:30:27,709 --> 02:30:31,789
down and inspect the [ __ ] out of it if

4125
02:30:29,270 --> 02:30:33,470
you see any signs of bugs any kinds of

4126
02:30:31,789 --> 02:30:35,270
pests that's when we need to get in

4127
02:30:33,469 --> 02:30:36,648
there and really deal with it hopefully

4128
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:38,988
you're not too far into flower by the

4129
02:30:36,648 --> 02:30:40,488
time we discover a pest if you're in

4130
02:30:38,988 --> 02:30:41,840
flower when we discover pests that's a

4131
02:30:40,488 --> 02:30:43,850
whole nother conversation that's when

4132
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:45,828
you have to decide are these pests going

4133
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:48,050
to ruin my garden before harvest time or

4134
02:30:45,828 --> 02:30:49,549
can I Radek ate these pests somehow

4135
02:30:48,049 --> 02:30:51,738
there are a lot of decisions to make in

4136
02:30:49,549 --> 02:30:52,998
that scramble mode we'll talk about that

4137
02:30:51,738 --> 02:30:56,868
in another episode I do have a whole

4138
02:30:52,998 --> 02:30:59,840
pest management episode and the works so

4139
02:30:56,869 --> 02:31:01,369
week six we have lowered the tips that's

4140
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:02,539
our last big feeding we got chunky

4141
02:31:01,369 --> 02:31:04,819
bullets hopefully took a lot of pictures

4142
02:31:02,539 --> 02:31:07,699
in week six because week six is

4143
02:31:04,818 --> 02:31:09,168
photogenic week seven this is when we

4144
02:31:07,699 --> 02:31:11,390
start what I've been calling the third

4145
02:31:09,168 --> 02:31:14,299
trimester this is ripening and the flush

4146
02:31:11,389 --> 02:31:16,398
phase we won't feed most of our

4147
02:31:14,299 --> 02:31:19,549
nutrients this week I would only use the

4148
02:31:16,398 --> 02:31:21,738
humble honey for the yucca extract and

4149
02:31:19,549 --> 02:31:23,028
the sweetener in there that's really

4150
02:31:21,738 --> 02:31:24,708
gonna make your plant sweet it's gonna

4151
02:31:23,029 --> 02:31:26,359
make them dense up and it's gonna make

4152
02:31:24,709 --> 02:31:30,260
them taste good and it's gonna make them

4153
02:31:26,359 --> 02:31:32,418
stinky I would also use cplex I think

4154
02:31:30,260 --> 02:31:35,090
SEAPLEX really contributes to the aroma

4155
02:31:32,418 --> 02:31:36,859
and flavor of a cush dominant plant a

4156
02:31:35,090 --> 02:31:39,049
lot of SEAPLEX and your cushy plants

4157
02:31:36,859 --> 02:31:41,959
will bring out that funk that fede smell

4158
02:31:39,049 --> 02:31:43,068
I really love it a grateful dog loves

4159
02:31:41,959 --> 02:31:45,470
SEAPLEX

4160
02:31:43,068 --> 02:31:48,559
if you're growing grateful dog when you

4161
02:31:45,469 --> 02:31:49,879
track it open there is a an offensive

4162
02:31:48,559 --> 02:31:52,158
odor that comes out of it it's almost

4163
02:31:49,879 --> 02:31:54,738
foot like it's almost armpit like and it

4164
02:31:52,158 --> 02:31:57,770
has a scent of fuel to it I think if you

4165
02:31:54,738 --> 02:31:59,748
pump up the SEAPLEX or a sea kelp based

4166
02:31:57,770 --> 02:32:01,609
product when you grow grateful dog it

4167
02:31:59,748 --> 02:32:03,421
will definitely increase that funky

4168
02:32:01,609 --> 02:32:06,871
aster pain

4169
02:32:03,421 --> 02:32:09,181
so we're using couple honey cplex hydros

4170
02:32:06,870 --> 02:32:12,090
I'm also I like enzymes at this face to

4171
02:32:09,181 --> 02:32:14,190
start breaking down dead material dead

4172
02:32:12,091 --> 02:32:16,110
roots that have maybe deep died and need

4173
02:32:14,190 --> 02:32:17,610
to be decomposed in their the hikers

4174
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:19,081
line will help eliminate that [ __ ] and

4175
02:32:17,610 --> 02:32:21,181
speed things along for the flush phase

4176
02:32:19,081 --> 02:32:22,979
also add some full vex if you want to

4177
02:32:21,181 --> 02:32:25,649
speed things up and our friend Sean

4178
02:32:22,979 --> 02:32:27,841
taught us that you can use Oh G T to

4179
02:32:25,649 --> 02:32:30,091
speed up the flushing phase of your

4180
02:32:27,841 --> 02:32:30,780
plants because the rock phosphates make

4181
02:32:30,091 --> 02:32:32,521
the plant

4182
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:34,681
cycle too quickly it speeds up the

4183
02:32:32,521 --> 02:32:36,239
nutritive cycle so that will kind of

4184
02:32:34,681 --> 02:32:38,971
assist us in the flush phase if we like

4185
02:32:36,239 --> 02:32:42,001
to I do not use any of that [ __ ] like

4186
02:32:38,970 --> 02:32:44,489
final phase or clear X or any of that um

4187
02:32:42,001 --> 02:32:46,229
I feel like that stuff leaves a little

4188
02:32:44,489 --> 02:32:47,790
bit of a flavor in the plant and I also

4189
02:32:46,229 --> 02:32:50,069
believe that if we are growing properly

4190
02:32:47,790 --> 02:32:51,510
and we're flushing properly we don't

4191
02:32:50,069 --> 02:32:53,790
need that product that's just another

4192
02:32:51,511 --> 02:32:55,591
product to sell there is a science

4193
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:58,290
behind it like I said earlier we are

4194
02:32:55,591 --> 02:33:00,450
filling the plant with salts and those

4195
02:32:58,290 --> 02:33:02,819
flushing agents are basically sugars and

4196
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:04,860
complexions breakdown salts which would

4197
02:33:02,819 --> 02:33:08,149
break the bond of the salt around the

4198
02:33:04,860 --> 02:33:10,291
Newt the root base which would allow

4199
02:33:08,149 --> 02:33:11,460
cleaner absorption of the roots and

4200
02:33:10,290 --> 02:33:13,199
everything will just taste better and

4201
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:14,729
flow better but I don't think that

4202
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:17,461
they're necessary unless you [ __ ] up

4203
02:33:14,729 --> 02:33:20,011
at some point they grow so we're very

4204
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:21,810
close to harvest time we really need to

4205
02:33:20,011 --> 02:33:23,610
start getting the excess nutrients out

4206
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:26,520
of our buds before we cut them down and

4207
02:33:23,610 --> 02:33:27,931
prepare them so we need to start getting

4208
02:33:26,521 --> 02:33:31,831
the nitrogen the phosphorus the

4209
02:33:27,931 --> 02:33:33,390
potassium the mag anaise the calcium

4210
02:33:31,831 --> 02:33:35,069
magnesium all the [ __ ] that we've been

4211
02:33:33,390 --> 02:33:39,569
shoving into these plants we want to get

4212
02:33:35,069 --> 02:33:42,270
it out of there now so that moves us

4213
02:33:39,569 --> 02:33:43,860
into week eight excuse me week eight is

4214
02:33:42,271 --> 02:33:46,921
the beginning the official beginning of

4215
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:48,751
the flush phase um what I like to do and

4216
02:33:46,921 --> 02:33:50,640
this kind of depends on your setup if

4217
02:33:48,751 --> 02:33:52,110
you have smaller pots you can move the

4218
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:54,720
pots to the bathroom of the shower

4219
02:33:52,110 --> 02:33:55,921
throw a cinder block put something down

4220
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:57,421
so you don't scratch up the baths to

4221
02:33:55,921 --> 02:33:59,130
over the shower you guys put a towel

4222
02:33:57,421 --> 02:34:01,890
down throw a cinder block or a bucket

4223
02:33:59,130 --> 02:34:03,600
right in the bathtub or the shower and

4224
02:34:01,890 --> 02:34:05,699
then if you're using a three gallon pot

4225
02:34:03,601 --> 02:34:07,650
I like to run about nine or ten gallons

4226
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:10,171
of water right through that pot I know

4227
02:34:07,649 --> 02:34:11,609
that sounds excessive but what you're

4228
02:34:10,171 --> 02:34:13,591
doing you want to walk you're washing

4229
02:34:11,610 --> 02:34:14,940
the dirt you want to get all of the

4230
02:34:13,591 --> 02:34:15,979
nutrients that we've poured into this

4231
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:18,261
plant through the past

4232
02:34:15,979 --> 02:34:20,539
seven weeks we need to rinse all that

4233
02:34:18,261 --> 02:34:21,771
[ __ ] out of the dirt now so and it's

4234
02:34:20,540 --> 02:34:23,780
also in the plant the plant has been

4235
02:34:21,771 --> 02:34:26,450
eating it so we have to kind of starve

4236
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:28,881
the plant for the next two weeks if

4237
02:34:26,450 --> 02:34:30,980
you're using bigger pots it might not be

4238
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:33,560
feasible or rational to drag them to

4239
02:34:30,979 --> 02:34:35,270
another room that's fine in a seven

4240
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:36,739
gallon pot I usually pour about a gallon

4241
02:34:35,271 --> 02:34:38,301
and a half of water through it and just

4242
02:34:36,739 --> 02:34:41,000
let it fill up in that little tray and

4243
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:42,699
then I use a shop vac a wet/dry vac to

4244
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:45,140
go suck the water out of the trays I

4245
02:34:42,700 --> 02:34:46,909
know that sounds excessive but I really

4246
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:48,949
like to clean out the plants if this

4247
02:34:46,909 --> 02:34:50,511
method doesn't work for you well you

4248
02:34:48,950 --> 02:34:53,181
have to really focus on when you're

4249
02:34:50,511 --> 02:34:55,970
flushing you want water to come out of

4250
02:34:53,181 --> 02:34:57,829
the bottom of the pot you need like if I

4251
02:34:55,970 --> 02:34:59,359
would like to say at least ten percent

4252
02:34:57,829 --> 02:35:00,681
of the water I want to see that come

4253
02:34:59,360 --> 02:35:03,110
back out of the bottom that's how I know

4254
02:35:00,681 --> 02:35:04,341
I'm actually flushing that plan and

4255
02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:05,450
pushing something out if nothing's

4256
02:35:04,341 --> 02:35:08,030
coming out of the bottom nothing's

4257
02:35:05,450 --> 02:35:09,801
coming out you got to get water to float

4258
02:35:08,030 --> 02:35:12,261
to get all those nutrients out and

4259
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:13,699
you're gonna want to do that without

4260
02:35:12,261 --> 02:35:16,159
drowning your plant you're gonna want to

4261
02:35:13,700 --> 02:35:18,530
flush it let it kind of dry and then

4262
02:35:16,159 --> 02:35:21,079
flush it again as many times as we can

4263
02:35:18,530 --> 02:35:23,181
until the end of week nine so the week

4264
02:35:21,079 --> 02:35:24,440
eight is a start of flushing you're

4265
02:35:23,181 --> 02:35:26,450
probably gonna water the [ __ ] out of it

4266
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:28,551
on Monday it's not gonna be ready for

4267
02:35:26,450 --> 02:35:31,780
water again until probably Thursday or

4268
02:35:28,550 --> 02:35:34,100
Friday because you watered it so heavily

4269
02:35:31,780 --> 02:35:35,421
don't be in too much of a rush to water

4270
02:35:34,101 --> 02:35:37,610
it again because you will drown the damn

4271
02:35:35,421 --> 02:35:39,890
planet so Thursday or Friday when you

4272
02:35:37,610 --> 02:35:41,900
water it again do the same thing lots of

4273
02:35:39,890 --> 02:35:43,761
water just lots of water just let it go

4274
02:35:41,899 --> 02:35:46,369
right on through just let it drain right

4275
02:35:43,761 --> 02:35:47,659
on through if you've got like a floor

4276
02:35:46,370 --> 02:35:49,521
drain or something just keep pouring

4277
02:35:47,659 --> 02:35:53,110
water through you can't over flush in my

4278
02:35:49,521 --> 02:35:55,700
opinion it's ideal to use three times

4279
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:58,310
the volume of the pot so if you've got a

4280
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:59,690
nine gallon pot or a three gallon pot

4281
02:35:58,310 --> 02:36:01,039
you want to use nine gallons of water if

4282
02:35:59,690 --> 02:36:02,480
you've got a five gallon pot you want to

4283
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:03,560
put fifteen gallons of water through

4284
02:36:02,479 --> 02:36:05,930
that [ __ ]

4285
02:36:03,559 --> 02:36:07,609
right no what I said finally I'll pop 15

4286
02:36:05,930 --> 02:36:08,898
gals why that's three times yeah just

4287
02:36:07,609 --> 02:36:11,180
making sure I'm doing good math here

4288
02:36:08,898 --> 02:36:12,828
head injuries coming back alright so

4289
02:36:11,180 --> 02:36:14,479
flush really good you guys I [ __ ] a lot

4290
02:36:12,828 --> 02:36:17,748
about cannabis because it's improperly

4291
02:36:14,478 --> 02:36:19,248
flushed when you're smoking a joint if

4292
02:36:17,748 --> 02:36:21,708
the joint won't stay lit if you have to

4293
02:36:19,248 --> 02:36:23,658
keep relighting it there's a good chance

4294
02:36:21,709 --> 02:36:25,789
it wasn't flushed properly or I rolled

4295
02:36:23,658 --> 02:36:28,788
it and I don't roll with the [ __ ] but if

4296
02:36:25,789 --> 02:36:30,319
your ashes are black and chunky there

4297
02:36:28,789 --> 02:36:33,049
are still nutrients in there you want a

4298
02:36:30,318 --> 02:36:34,338
nice clean white ash that's nice and

4299
02:36:33,049 --> 02:36:36,319
smooth and soft

4300
02:36:34,338 --> 02:36:38,539
you don't want chunks if you ask me your

4301
02:36:36,318 --> 02:36:40,609
hand it should feel nice you should

4302
02:36:38,539 --> 02:36:42,709
almost enjoy that nice smooth texture of

4303
02:36:40,609 --> 02:36:45,979
the ashes if your plants were flushed

4304
02:36:42,709 --> 02:36:47,539
properly one of my biggest complaints

4305
02:36:45,978 --> 02:36:50,028
about dispensary cannabis and I am

4306
02:36:47,539 --> 02:36:52,310
trying to fix this in my shop they don't

4307
02:36:50,029 --> 02:36:54,588
flush they do not flush and they do not

4308
02:36:52,309 --> 02:36:55,728
cure they pretty much say shits done cut

4309
02:36:54,588 --> 02:36:56,959
it down and sell it and I don't like

4310
02:36:55,728 --> 02:36:59,658
that so we're gonna try to change that

4311
02:36:56,959 --> 02:37:01,489
where I'm working flushing is important

4312
02:36:59,658 --> 02:37:03,889
you guys I can't stress that so from

4313
02:37:01,488 --> 02:37:05,208
week eight you want to flush run plenty

4314
02:37:03,889 --> 02:37:08,568
of clean water through that pot week

4315
02:37:05,209 --> 02:37:11,838
nine flushing is in full effect week

4316
02:37:08,568 --> 02:37:14,118
nine ends at day 63 on day 60 here's

4317
02:37:11,838 --> 02:37:16,100
what I recommend go in the grow room and

4318
02:37:14,119 --> 02:37:18,979
start taking off all of the big fan

4319
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:21,289
leaves any leaf that has a PD 'el that's

4320
02:37:18,978 --> 02:37:22,969
a stem you guys any leaf that has a stem

4321
02:37:21,289 --> 02:37:24,560
that you can get to take some scissors

4322
02:37:22,969 --> 02:37:26,719
and cut that [ __ ] off really close to

4323
02:37:24,559 --> 02:37:28,548
the bud just go in there and delete the

4324
02:37:26,719 --> 02:37:30,498
entire room you don't need these leaves

4325
02:37:28,549 --> 02:37:33,140
anymore this is gonna save you time when

4326
02:37:30,498 --> 02:37:34,609
it comes to harvest so day 60 you walked

4327
02:37:33,139 --> 02:37:37,728
in there and he took off all of those

4328
02:37:34,609 --> 02:37:40,729
leaves boom now this may sound crazy

4329
02:37:37,728 --> 02:37:43,219
this is what I do in my groves I've got

4330
02:37:40,728 --> 02:37:46,788
three days left right on the first on

4331
02:37:43,219 --> 02:37:49,488
day 61 I reduce my lights from 12 12 to

4332
02:37:46,789 --> 02:37:51,498
10 14 I'm on for 10 hours and I'm off

4333
02:37:49,488 --> 02:37:53,448
for 14 the plants are going oh [ __ ] he's

4334
02:37:51,498 --> 02:37:55,908
gonna kill us now the time is near they

4335
02:37:53,449 --> 02:37:58,908
know it the next day I'll drop him down

4336
02:37:55,908 --> 02:38:01,128
to eight hours I'm on day three I'll

4337
02:37:58,908 --> 02:38:03,978
give in 24 hours of total darkness so

4338
02:38:01,129 --> 02:38:06,100
day 63 no light at all I'll leave them

4339
02:38:03,978 --> 02:38:08,679
off for the entire day

4340
02:38:06,100 --> 02:38:10,979
day 64 wake up bright and early nice and

4341
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:13,359
ready go in and cut down the entire room

4342
02:38:10,978 --> 02:38:17,078
and just let them hang that's harvest

4343
02:38:13,359 --> 02:38:18,399
day that's 63 or 64 days you guys nine

4344
02:38:17,078 --> 02:38:21,549
weeks of full flower I got through that

4345
02:38:18,398 --> 02:38:23,078
in 30 minutes I didn't have to kind of I

4346
02:38:21,549 --> 02:38:24,248
did have to kind of skip a couple of

4347
02:38:23,078 --> 02:38:25,238
details I'm gonna take a drink I'm sorry

4348
02:38:24,248 --> 02:38:27,039
I'm trying to talk right through this

4349
02:38:25,238 --> 02:38:29,469
but I got a throat let me take a drink

4350
02:38:27,039 --> 02:38:31,510
here that's a little better I got you

4351
02:38:29,469 --> 02:38:33,458
guys through nine weeks in 30 minutes I

4352
02:38:31,510 --> 02:38:34,869
left some stuff out but I feel like that

4353
02:38:33,459 --> 02:38:36,579
leaves me more [ __ ] to teach you guys

4354
02:38:34,869 --> 02:38:38,770
and more tips to give you in the future

4355
02:38:36,578 --> 02:38:39,369
you'll survive a crop with everything I

4356
02:38:38,770 --> 02:38:41,439
taught you

4357
02:38:39,369 --> 02:38:43,720
I'm something that I should mention if

4358
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:46,809
you do grow a longer strain I would

4359
02:38:43,719 --> 02:38:50,318
recommend reducing the light to 11 hours

4360
02:38:46,809 --> 02:38:51,939
on and 13 hours off around week 9 this

4361
02:38:50,318 --> 02:38:56,288
is only for drawing something that takes

4362
02:38:51,939 --> 02:38:58,059
11 weeks or more some sativas won't

4363
02:38:56,289 --> 02:39:00,310
finish up without a shortened day period

4364
02:38:58,059 --> 02:39:02,618
the reason is they are from an area that

4365
02:39:00,309 --> 02:39:04,299
only have a few hours difference in the

4366
02:39:02,619 --> 02:39:06,159
natural day and night cycle so we need

4367
02:39:04,299 --> 02:39:07,838
to encourage them excuse me I just

4368
02:39:06,158 --> 02:39:09,578
burped Brent to the microphone we need

4369
02:39:07,838 --> 02:39:12,100
to encourage these plants to finish up

4370
02:39:09,578 --> 02:39:13,930
by shortening the days what happens when

4371
02:39:12,100 --> 02:39:17,770
we shorten the days is the plant

4372
02:39:13,930 --> 02:39:21,248
realizes that winter is coming and our

4373
02:39:17,770 --> 02:39:23,619
plants main goal is to pollinate and

4374
02:39:21,248 --> 02:39:25,270
create seeds and since it hasn't

4375
02:39:23,619 --> 02:39:26,918
received any pollen it's kind of being

4376
02:39:25,270 --> 02:39:29,470
stubborn about finishing it's like I

4377
02:39:26,918 --> 02:39:31,059
really think it's like a dude at a party

4378
02:39:29,469 --> 02:39:33,158
it thinks if it hangs out later enough

4379
02:39:31,059 --> 02:39:34,748
there's still a chance to get inlaid so

4380
02:39:33,158 --> 02:39:36,038
what we got to do is we got to start

4381
02:39:34,748 --> 02:39:38,498
messing with the lights and tell these

4382
02:39:36,039 --> 02:39:40,029
guys your time's up dude we got to tell

4383
02:39:38,498 --> 02:39:41,559
the girls actually I'm gonna turn the

4384
02:39:40,029 --> 02:39:43,869
lights down and they'll start finishing

4385
02:39:41,559 --> 02:39:45,639
on their own otherwise some of these

4386
02:39:43,869 --> 02:39:48,248
sativas will just keep on goin I had a

4387
02:39:45,639 --> 02:39:50,559
Durbin poison strain that went for 14

4388
02:39:48,248 --> 02:39:52,088
weeks and then I was getting tired of

4389
02:39:50,559 --> 02:39:53,978
that [ __ ] cuz needed the room and it

4390
02:39:52,088 --> 02:39:56,379
was I was done growing that strain in

4391
02:39:53,978 --> 02:39:57,728
that crop and I wouldn't finish and then

4392
02:39:56,379 --> 02:39:59,979
I thought well why don't I just reduce

4393
02:39:57,728 --> 02:40:01,238
the lights down a little bit and speed

4394
02:39:59,978 --> 02:40:03,038
this up and you know what within one

4395
02:40:01,238 --> 02:40:05,430
week of reducing the lights it finished

4396
02:40:03,039 --> 02:40:08,859
I just had to tell it so

4397
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:10,359
so also you may want to feed for a

4398
02:40:08,859 --> 02:40:13,420
little bit longer if you're running a

4399
02:40:10,359 --> 02:40:15,670
longer plan I would extend the week six

4400
02:40:13,420 --> 02:40:19,719
regimen if you have to extend anything

4401
02:40:15,670 --> 02:40:22,238
I'll just repeat week six until you get

4402
02:40:19,719 --> 02:40:24,219
to the like if you have three extra

4403
02:40:22,238 --> 02:40:26,170
weeks just do week six three extra times

4404
02:40:24,219 --> 02:40:28,028
that's what I'm trying to say here guys

4405
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:29,439
my voice is burning out I've got a

4406
02:40:28,029 --> 02:40:30,789
little bit more stuff here but I'm

4407
02:40:29,439 --> 02:40:32,439

really can I ordered a product from

4430
02:41:14,139 --> 02:41:17,978
Annette comm called alpha brain if you

4431
02:41:16,719 --> 02:41:19,448
listen to Joe Rogan or any of those

4432
02:41:17,978 --> 02:41:21,188
other podcasts you've heard about alpha

4433
02:41:19,449 --> 02:41:25,869
brain alpha brain is used by public

4434
02:41:21,189 --> 02:41:27,398
speakers and lecturers and folks in that

4435
02:41:25,869 --> 02:41:30,010
type of a position that have to speak

4436
02:41:27,398 --> 02:41:32,559
right but they say that alpha brain it's

4437
02:41:30,010 --> 02:41:34,960
a nootropic and it is supposed to

4438
02:41:32,559 --> 02:41:37,600
increase your ability to recall names

4439
02:41:34,959 --> 02:41:40,738
and facts and locations and it's

4440
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:43,779
supposed to broaden your vocabulary so

4441
02:41:40,738 --> 02:41:46,959
maybe that'll improve my head injury and

4442

out to everybody that's helped me out

4510
02:44:15,750 --> 02:44:19,409
this past week um I was driving up to

4511
02:44:18,029 --> 02:44:22,079
Colorado Springs to go see our good

4512
02:44:19,409 --> 02:44:24,568
friends hunt and damsel and of course

4513
02:44:22,079 --> 02:44:26,609
the Jordans and of course John Randall's

4514
02:44:24,568 --> 02:44:29,728
jr. was headed up there Springs gonna

4515
02:44:26,609 --> 02:44:32,040
make go pay them a visit and the [ __ ]

4516
02:44:29,728 --> 02:44:34,769
transmission went out on my car about a

4517
02:44:32,040 --> 02:44:36,540
mile from Colorado Springs I could see

4518
02:44:34,770 --> 02:44:38,189
the first exit in Colorado Springs I

4519
02:44:36,540 --> 02:44:40,470
could see the damn circle Drive Lake

4520
02:44:38,189 --> 02:44:41,790
Avenue sign right in front of me but I

4521
02:44:40,469 --> 02:44:44,159
just couldn't get off the highway my car

4522
02:44:41,790 --> 02:44:45,840
pretty much exploded it felt like I was

4523
02:44:44,159 --> 02:44:47,010
doing a good 75 miles an hour on the

4524
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:50,909
interstate in the rain

4525
02:44:47,010 --> 02:44:52,950
I felt like my car down shifted from 75

4526
02:44:50,909 --> 02:44:53,430
I immediately was going about 45 miles

4527
02:44:52,950 --> 02:44:58,260
an hour

4528
02:44:53,430 --> 02:45:00,329
it sounded like is what it felt like to

4529
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:01,829
me I felt like my engine was trying to

4530
02:45:00,329 --> 02:45:04,289
jump out of the car and into my lap so

4531
02:45:01,829 --> 02:45:05,579
of course I hit the brakes signal got

4532
02:45:04,290 --> 02:45:06,779
over as quickly as I could get to the

4533
02:45:05,579 --> 02:45:09,238
side of the road turn on the hazards

4534
02:45:06,779 --> 02:45:11,100
called triple-a it took triple-a they've

4535
02:45:09,238 --> 02:45:16,289
quoted me 85 minutes to get there they

4536
02:45:11,100 --> 02:45:17,939
got there in 65 so suck in 85 minute 85

4537
02:45:16,290 --> 02:45:19,620
minute wait is a long wait 65 minutes

4538
02:45:17,939 --> 02:45:21,779
was less than what they promised me so I

4539
02:45:19,620 --> 02:45:23,700
guess that that's a good job on triple

4540
02:45:21,779 --> 02:45:25,200
A's part I made friends with the Triple

4541
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:26,460
A tow truck driver I wish I had your

4542
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:28,319
business card with me right now in my

4543
02:45:26,459 --> 02:45:29,339
pocket but I have said it somewhere you

4544
02:45:28,318 --> 02:45:30,659
know what it's actually in the car

4545
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:32,639
that's broken down that is it the

4546
02:45:30,659 --> 02:45:33,568
mechanic shop so once I get your card

4547
02:45:32,639 --> 02:45:34,920
out of there I'll give you a shout-out

4548
02:45:33,568 --> 02:45:37,170
on the show because the truck driver was

4549
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:38,520
a cool guy they did a great job they

4550
02:45:37,170 --> 02:45:38,728
were super kind they'd had to tell me

4551
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:40,470
about

4552
02:45:38,728 --> 02:45:42,748
50 miles home get me back to the house

4553

4555

4575
02:46:20,969 --> 02:46:25,108

4577

02:46:30,809 --> 02:46:35,100
right here hold on all right I got the

4581
02:46:33,389 --> 02:46:37,049
bottle in my hand alpha brain is a

4582
02:46:35,100 --> 02:46:40,140
complete Earth grown nootropic with

4583
02:46:37,049 --> 02:46:41,988
alpha GPC and AC 11 you know that sounds

4584
02:46:40,139 --> 02:46:46,158
like a bunch of [ __ ] to you guys but

4585
02:46:41,988 --> 02:46:48,600
they say that lecturers educators

4586
02:46:46,158 --> 02:46:50,520
speakers public speakers radio

4587
02:46:48,600 --> 02:46:52,828
personalities and folks like that use

4588
02:46:50,520 --> 02:46:54,689
alpha brain the guy that inspired me to

4589
02:46:52,828 --> 02:46:56,369
use it is Joe Rogan when Joe Rogan does

4590
02:46:54,689 --> 02:46:58,680
his podcast he takes a couple alpha

4591
02:46:56,369 --> 02:47:00,828
brain when he does the UFC events he

4592
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:03,389
announces the commentates on the UFC's

4593
02:47:00,828 --> 02:47:06,420
he does 3 alpha brain pills for that

4594
02:47:03,389 --> 02:47:09,238
I've been taking two a day and I can

4595
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:12,478
feel a sharpness in my brain my

4596
02:47:09,238 --> 02:47:13,680
vocabulary is stronger I had a problem

4597
02:47:12,478 --> 02:47:15,568
after I hit my head I would try to

4598
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:18,479
recall words and I'd say hey can you

4599
02:47:15,568 --> 02:47:20,368
hand me my my and I just couldn't think

4600
02:47:18,478 --> 02:47:23,278
of what basic words were like

4601
02:47:20,369 --> 02:47:25,050
screwdriver or a flashlight sometimes I

4602
02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:26,760
would just forget words but the Alpha

4603
02:47:25,049 --> 02:47:28,799
brain is making that [ __ ] come back to

4604
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:31,949
me it's making me a better speaker it's

4605
02:47:28,799 --> 02:47:33,929
making me remember and recall more let's

4606
02:47:31,949 --> 02:47:35,279
we can be calmer I've described it as

4607
02:47:33,930 --> 02:47:36,600
maybe I've said this on the show maybe

4608
02:47:35,279 --> 02:47:38,578
I'm full of [ __ ] with my memory saying

4609
02:47:36,600 --> 02:47:40,439
but I've described it as my brain has

4610
02:47:38,578 --> 02:47:42,270
the main track that's happening there's

4611
02:47:40,439 --> 02:47:43,559
like gotta wake up you gotta poop you

4612
02:47:42,270 --> 02:47:44,939
gotta brush your teeth you got to get to

4613
02:47:43,559 --> 02:47:46,738
work on time you got to do your chores

4614
02:47:44,939 --> 02:47:47,970
you got to call this person you know

4615
02:47:46,738 --> 02:47:48,600
that track is playing in your head but

4616
02:47:47,969 --> 02:47:50,278
there's all

4617
02:47:48,600 --> 02:47:53,430
side [ __ ] that goes on in your head

4618
02:47:50,279 --> 02:47:55,590
like taxes and it just whispers at you

4619
02:47:53,430 --> 02:47:58,260
occasionally or I wonder what that

4620
02:47:55,590 --> 02:47:59,520
girl's doing or I miss somebody or just

4621
02:47:58,260 --> 02:48:00,960
[ __ ] that happens in your head that

4622
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:02,699
you really don't need to be focusing on

4623
02:48:00,959 --> 02:48:04,618
right now I feel like weird things pop

4624
02:48:02,699 --> 02:48:06,720
up into your head and the alpha brain

4625
02:48:04,619 --> 02:48:08,550
has kind of quieted that secondary track

4626
02:48:06,719 --> 02:48:11,698
so what I'm able to focus on what I'm

4627
02:48:08,549 --> 02:48:13,019
supposed to focus on which gets me to my

4628
02:48:11,699 --> 02:48:14,100
point the podcasts are getting much

4629
02:48:13,020 --> 02:48:16,500
better you guys I'm gonna make the

4630
02:48:14,100 --> 02:48:17,699
podcast a lot better much much better so

4631
02:48:16,500 --> 02:48:19,829
shout out to alpha brain shout out to

4632
02:48:17,699 --> 02:48:23,399
Han it labs I take two a day

4633
02:48:19,829 --> 02:48:24,779
and I definitely feel I'm more talkative

4634
02:48:23,398 --> 02:48:26,760
but it's because my thoughts are more

4635
02:48:24,779 --> 02:48:29,100
clear and I could put together much

4636
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:30,658
better sentences much better podcasts

4637
02:48:29,100 --> 02:48:32,699
definitely how do I got the phone on

4638
02:48:30,658 --> 02:48:34,379
loud here that's ridiculous they put

4639
02:48:32,699 --> 02:48:36,090
that [ __ ] on silent I apologize that's

4640
02:48:34,379 --> 02:48:42,448
very unprofessional podcast behavior

4641
02:48:36,090 --> 02:48:44,670
here we go another product you heard us

4642
02:48:42,449 --> 02:48:47,640
talk about Floria on a previous podcast

4643
02:48:44,670 --> 02:48:50,520
episode Floria is a medicated personal

4644
02:48:47,639 --> 02:48:52,579
lubricant which means it is a sexual

4645
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:54,720
lubricant that it contains cannabis

4646
02:48:52,579 --> 02:48:56,728
somebody heard that I talked about it on

4647
02:48:54,719 --> 02:48:59,099
the show and they gave me a product

4648
02:48:56,728 --> 02:49:02,488
called Evo's and from what I can tell

4649
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:04,380
Evo's and Floria are very very similar

4650
02:49:02,488 --> 02:49:05,039
fairly similar was what I wanted to say

4651
02:49:04,379 --> 02:49:07,738
ahh

4652
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:09,420
they are both coconut oil infused with

4653
02:49:07,738 --> 02:49:11,760
cannabis and they are meant to be

4654
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:12,988
applied to you know the instructions

4655
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:15,210
pretty much they apply it to the

4656
02:49:12,988 --> 02:49:19,529
female's parts so I'm gonna be straight

4657
02:49:15,209 --> 02:49:22,978
up about this I got some Evo's and I my

4658
02:49:19,529 --> 02:49:25,560
partner's goods and uh it made a

4659
02:49:22,978 --> 02:49:27,568
difference it definitely there was

4660
02:49:25,559 --> 02:49:28,978
nothing to complain about before

4661
02:49:27,568 --> 02:49:30,689
everything was going just fine but when

4662
02:49:28,978 --> 02:49:33,329
we added that stuff it made it a little

4663
02:49:30,689 --> 02:49:35,488
uh it made my junk warm it felt like

4664
02:49:33,329 --> 02:49:37,379
it's already warm I know but it felt a

4665
02:49:35,488 --> 02:49:40,049
little warmer and tingly or it made my

4666
02:49:37,379 --> 02:49:42,028
stuff feel a little more alert like it

4667
02:49:40,049 --> 02:49:44,219
was definitely a heightened experience

4668
02:49:42,029 --> 02:49:45,840
and she agreed she said that it was

4669
02:49:44,219 --> 02:49:48,179
definitely a heightened experience it's

4670
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:50,100
just coconut oil and cannabis so I had

4671
02:49:48,180 --> 02:49:52,979
no worries about putting it on my body

4672
02:49:50,100 --> 02:49:55,949
or in her body or whatever it washed off

4673
02:49:52,978 --> 02:49:57,719
really cleanly and really quickly one

4674
02:49:55,949 --> 02:49:59,220
funny thing that I said when I was done

4675
02:49:57,719 --> 02:50:00,389
and I'm sorry if I'm being too explicit

4676
02:49:59,219 --> 02:50:00,959
you guys but it's my podcast and I'll

4677
02:50:00,389 --> 02:50:04,920
talk about my

4678
02:50:00,959 --> 02:50:08,009
if I want what I was done ah I was I

4679
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:09,690
felt I wasn't aroused okay I was all

4680
02:50:08,010 --> 02:50:11,850
done and soft I don't want floppy but I

4681
02:50:09,690 --> 02:50:13,710
felt like my dick was fluffy like I've

4682
02:50:11,850 --> 02:50:15,479
given somebody a massage with a posse

4683
02:50:13,709 --> 02:50:16,799
can a lotion before and I've explained

4684
02:50:15,478 --> 02:50:19,019
my hands like feeling like I was wearing

4685
02:50:16,799 --> 02:50:21,329
Mickey Mouse gloves my dick felt like it

4686
02:50:19,020 --> 02:50:23,310
was fluffy like to the touch if I would

4687
02:50:21,329 --> 02:50:27,750
touch it I felt like it was thicker than

4688
02:50:23,309 --> 02:50:30,119
it was that's a weird on the show but I

4689
02:50:27,750 --> 02:50:31,649
tried the Evo's and if you're looking

4690
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:32,970
for something to add to the bedroom fun

4691
02:50:31,649 --> 02:50:35,250
and you want to go to the dispensary and

4692
02:50:32,969 --> 02:50:36,840
spend a few bucks there is nothing wrong

4693
02:50:35,250 --> 02:50:38,299
with evos it worked I would use it I

4694
02:50:36,840 --> 02:50:40,049
would do that again if you're listening

4695
02:50:38,299 --> 02:50:42,840
let's do that again

4696
02:50:40,049 --> 02:50:44,939
so we talked about alpha brain we talked

4697
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:46,469
about Evo's let's change the tone a

4698
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:49,380
little bit this is something that is not

4699
02:50:46,469 --> 02:50:51,269
good that happens um I was trying to

4700
02:50:49,379 --> 02:50:52,379
explain to a friend something and I

4701
02:50:51,270 --> 02:50:54,210
don't know the science behind it but I

4702
02:50:52,379 --> 02:50:57,209
know that this is happening when my dad

4703
02:50:54,209 --> 02:50:58,949
break gets dirty my chunk of globby

4704
02:50:57,209 --> 02:51:00,539
resin in there and this probably applies

4705
02:50:58,950 --> 02:51:01,950
to the bond with bond resin if you're

4706
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:04,710
just smoking flour but I've noticed that

4707
02:51:01,950 --> 02:51:06,990
when I'm hitting the dab break once the

4708
02:51:04,709 --> 02:51:08,909
rig gets dirty I feel like that chunk of

4709
02:51:06,989 --> 02:51:10,889
resin in there is actually stealing part

4710
02:51:08,909 --> 02:51:12,659
of my dad I feel like when you've got a

4711
02:51:10,889 --> 02:51:15,000
big floater if you look at my rig right

4712
02:51:12,659 --> 02:51:16,770
now there is like a quarter gram of hash

4713
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:18,450
just floating in my rig water and it's

4714
02:51:16,770 --> 02:51:20,130
not old the rig water has only been in

4715
02:51:18,450 --> 02:51:22,890
there for three or four days at the most

4716
02:51:20,129 --> 02:51:24,929
we just dab heavy here the seal never

4717
02:51:22,889 --> 02:51:26,430
turns off you guys that's like the

4718
02:51:24,930 --> 02:51:27,479
coffee pot it turns on at a certain time

4719
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:30,479
in the morning and then it goes off

4720
02:51:27,478 --> 02:51:32,250
right when I go to bed so I'm taking big

4721
02:51:30,478 --> 02:51:34,319
fat gloves are now clean the regen take

4722
02:51:32,250 --> 02:51:35,760
fat globs fat globs I get super baked

4723
02:51:34,319 --> 02:51:37,949
like just like I should but as the rig

4724
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:40,020
gets dirtier I stop getting as high and

4725
02:51:37,950 --> 02:51:41,790
stop choking and stop enjoying my dab as

4726
02:51:40,020 --> 02:51:43,500
much as it gets dirtier I think that

4727
02:51:41,790 --> 02:51:45,150
chunk of resin in there collects the

4728
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:46,409
resin that's the smoke it collects all

4729
02:51:45,149 --> 02:51:47,969
your cannabinoids and your smoke and

4730
02:51:46,409 --> 02:51:49,920
your whatever you're trying to get it

4731
02:51:47,969 --> 02:51:52,978
sticks to that ball and it's ripping you

4732
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:55,110
off so my point clean the [ __ ] rig go

4733
02:51:52,978 --> 02:51:56,519
get some rubbing alcohol if it's really

4734
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:58,739
super sticky get yourself some kosher

4735
02:51:56,520 --> 02:52:00,390
salt fill the rig halfway up with

4736
02:51:58,739 --> 02:52:01,799
alcohol put a little bit of kosher salt

4737
02:52:00,389 --> 02:52:03,209
in there the salt is working as an

4738
02:52:01,799 --> 02:52:05,689
abrasive it's gonna scratch all that

4739
02:52:03,209 --> 02:52:08,219
resin off of there cover up both holes

4740
02:52:05,690 --> 02:52:09,750
go somewhere you got a carpeted floor if

4741
02:52:08,219 --> 02:52:10,978
you're a pothead and to shake the [ __ ]

4742
02:52:09,750 --> 02:52:11,700
out of that rig and the reason we're

4743
02:52:10,978 --> 02:52:13,529
going to the carpeted

4744
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:16,290
so that when you drop the rig you have a

4745
02:52:13,530 --> 02:52:17,940
better chance of living just be careful

4746
02:52:16,290 --> 02:52:21,210
just go shake the [ __ ] out of that rig

4747
02:52:17,940 --> 02:52:22,890
and then yeah that's disgusting but just

4748
02:52:21,209 --> 02:52:24,000
pour all that [ __ ] reclaim right down

4749
02:52:22,890 --> 02:52:25,379
the drain and get rid of it you don't

4750
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,760
want that I know a lot of people that

4751
02:52:25,379 --> 02:52:28,649
use it I'm not gonna hey Lenny if you do

4752
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:31,409
I wouldn't use it especially if you just

4753
02:52:28,649 --> 02:52:32,609
mix alcohol into it but flush that [ __ ]

4754
02:52:31,409 --> 02:52:34,110
right down the drain get rid of it and

4755
02:52:32,610 --> 02:52:36,420
then rinse the rig out a couple of times

4756
02:52:34,110 --> 02:52:38,040
with super hot water let it dry let it

4757
02:52:36,420 --> 02:52:40,590
cool down to a normal tip fill it back

4758
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:41,820
up with water at the right depth what is

4759
02:52:40,590 --> 02:52:43,681
that a right amount of water whatever

4760
02:52:41,819 --> 02:52:45,420
the right level throw your nail on there

4761
02:52:43,681 --> 02:52:47,250
and get down on some clean tasty dabs

4762
02:52:45,420 --> 02:52:48,931
and enjoy the flavor of your dabs again

4763
02:52:47,250 --> 02:52:51,690
I really think a clean rig is more

4764
02:52:48,931 --> 02:52:53,370
important than people realize alright

4765
02:52:51,690 --> 02:52:56,810
that's enough of that PSA I've got more

4766
02:52:53,370 --> 02:52:59,280
[ __ ] written down here what else is next

4767
02:52:56,810 --> 02:53:00,840
somebody was asking me I got an email or

4768
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:02,280
a Facebook message I cannot recall where

4769
02:53:00,840 --> 02:53:04,829
it came from right now but somebody was

4770
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:08,400
asking me about rig selection how do I

4771
02:53:04,829 --> 02:53:11,940
choose a good rig personally if you're

4772
02:53:08,399 --> 02:53:13,979
dabbing I prefer a small rig over a big

4773
02:53:11,940 --> 02:53:16,110
piece the reason we used to smoke pop

4774
02:53:13,979 --> 02:53:18,600
out of a giant bong is so that you can

4775
02:53:16,110 --> 02:53:20,460
fill all that space with the big thick

4776
02:53:18,601 --> 02:53:22,079
chunky hit of smoke and then when you

4777
02:53:20,459 --> 02:53:23,609
pull that carb or you pull the bowl out

4778
02:53:22,079 --> 02:53:25,351
or you take your finger off however you

4779
02:53:23,610 --> 02:53:26,670
carb your bowl or your bong if you're

4780
02:53:25,351 --> 02:53:28,290
from the 70s you just take your finger

4781
02:53:26,670 --> 02:53:29,489
off that hole in the back if you're from

4782
02:53:28,290 --> 02:53:31,260
the future you got to pull the stem out

4783
02:53:29,489 --> 02:53:33,000
when you carve it you're supposed to get

4784
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:35,159
all that [ __ ] smoke and your lungs

4785
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:36,719
right at once boom you just got a big ol

4786
02:53:35,159 --> 02:53:38,670
bong hit and that's why you get baked

4787
02:53:36,719 --> 02:53:40,609
from the bong that's the purpose fill

4788
02:53:38,670 --> 02:53:44,579
that piece clear it get all your smoke

4789
02:53:40,610 --> 02:53:45,750
when we're smoking dabs your dabs just

4790
02:53:44,579 --> 02:53:47,010
burning up right when you put it on the

4791
02:53:45,750 --> 02:53:48,899
nail and you start smoking and you're

4792
02:53:47,010 --> 02:53:50,610
getting it I don't think we need a big

4793
02:53:48,899 --> 02:53:52,681
ass piece for a dab I like the little

4794
02:53:50,610 --> 02:53:54,720
tiny rig tour when you put it on there

4795
02:53:52,681 --> 02:53:56,640
you put the carb cap on there you inhale

4796
02:53:54,719 --> 02:53:59,459
you get that smoke right to your face

4797
02:53:56,640 --> 02:54:01,170
we're not trying to build a whole bunch

4798
02:53:59,459 --> 02:54:02,819
of smoke into one chamber and then clear

4799
02:54:01,170 --> 02:54:04,290
it we just want that dab you go through

4800
02:54:02,819 --> 02:54:07,409
the rig through the water to cool and

4801
02:54:04,290 --> 02:54:08,790
then into your face so my main

4802
02:54:07,409 --> 02:54:10,649
recommendation is something kind of

4803
02:54:08,790 --> 02:54:12,330
small my favourite rig and you're gonna

4804
02:54:10,649 --> 02:54:14,729
think I'm crazy but my favourite rig is

4805
02:54:12,329 --> 02:54:16,920
my hitman sidecar it's just the right

4806
02:54:14,729 --> 02:54:19,709
height I'm thinking that's probably five

4807
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:20,790
inches tall something like that if you

4808
02:54:19,709 --> 02:54:23,909
go up to the mouthpiece it's probably

4809
02:54:20,790 --> 02:54:25,090
seven inches tall it's a little rig I

4810
02:54:23,909 --> 02:54:26,920
like my mad Robbery

4811
02:54:25,090 --> 02:54:29,648
that suckers probably four inches tall

4812
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:32,469
at the most you don't need a lot of

4813
02:54:29,648 --> 02:54:34,180
percolation on a rig if you've got

4814
02:54:32,469 --> 02:54:35,978
something that gets plenty of bubbles

4815
02:54:34,180 --> 02:54:38,170
you don't need a lot of diffusion all

4816
02:54:35,978 --> 02:54:39,369
you want to do is call a cool your dab

4817
02:54:38,170 --> 02:54:41,559
smoke you don't want it coming off of

4818
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:42,670
that hot nail directly into your lung so

4819
02:54:41,559 --> 02:54:44,799
you put a little water through there

4820
02:54:42,670 --> 02:54:47,079
just enough to cool it like I don't like

4821
02:54:44,799 --> 02:54:49,569
a lot of water on my rig and also I

4822
02:54:47,079 --> 02:54:51,819
think over percolation on a dab like if

4823
02:54:49,569 --> 02:54:53,590
you've got too many sections of water

4824
02:54:51,819 --> 02:54:55,809
you're kind of overdoing it I like to

4825
02:54:53,590 --> 02:54:57,309
Touro cans that have the the tree perk

4826
02:54:55,809 --> 02:54:59,139
and then it's got the little showerhead

4827
02:54:57,309 --> 02:55:02,139
perk in the middle those are great but

4828
02:54:59,139 --> 02:55:04,239
my favorite is the hitman I really do

4829
02:55:02,139 --> 02:55:05,648
like the mothership rigs those things

4830
02:55:04,239 --> 02:55:07,869
hit like a boss but you're looking at

4831
02:55:05,648 --> 02:55:09,069
like 2500 to 3000 for a rig if you're

4832
02:55:07,870 --> 02:55:10,950
asking me for advice

4833
02:55:09,069 --> 02:55:13,809
you don't need advice on a mothership

4834
02:55:10,950 --> 02:55:15,790
get yourself a nice hitman rig don't be

4835
02:55:13,809 --> 02:55:18,189
afraid of uh you don't have to buy

4836
02:55:15,790 --> 02:55:19,450
name-brand glass just keep in mind that

4837
02:55:18,189 --> 02:55:21,159
if you're buying Chinese made glass

4838
02:55:19,450 --> 02:55:23,439
there's probably some Chinese little kid

4839
02:55:21,159 --> 02:55:25,030
making it in unsafe conditions they

4840
02:55:23,439 --> 02:55:26,020
don't have good eye protection they're

4841
02:55:25,030 --> 02:55:28,300
probably barefoot

4842
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:30,550
just try to you can buy some American

4843
02:55:28,299 --> 02:55:33,279
class to do that it's worth the extra

4844
02:55:30,549 --> 02:55:34,779
few bucks just to know that you have

4845
02:55:33,280 --> 02:55:37,510
ethically made glass they think it's

4846
02:55:34,780 --> 02:55:38,890
some karma like I said hit man's a good

4847
02:55:37,510 --> 02:55:40,239
company they don't support the show or

4848
02:55:38,889 --> 02:55:42,099
anything but they're always innovators

4849
02:55:40,239 --> 02:55:44,199
they leave the glass game in my opinion

4850
02:55:42,100 --> 02:55:46,780
if you want to go expensive get yourself

4851
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:48,399
a oil or some beer glass or something

4852
02:55:46,780 --> 02:55:50,050
like that coils gonna be ridiculous you

4853
02:55:48,398 --> 02:55:52,989
guys I'm just talking about my favorite

4854
02:55:50,049 --> 02:55:54,759
rigs here one thing I'm gonna mention so

4855
02:55:52,989 --> 02:55:56,500
get a small rig with out a lot of

4856
02:55:54,760 --> 02:55:57,880
percolation something that keeps the

4857
02:55:56,500 --> 02:55:59,379
nail a little bit away from your face

4858
02:55:57,879 --> 02:56:01,059
when you're checking out these rigs at

4859
02:55:59,379 --> 02:56:02,500
the store trying to put the nail that

4860
02:56:01,059 --> 02:56:05,500
you're gonna buy right on that rig and

4861
02:56:02,500 --> 02:56:07,000
then see how far away that nail is from

4862
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:09,430
your face because I don't really like

4863
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:11,260
the nail higher than the mouthpiece or

4864
02:56:09,430 --> 02:56:13,479
reel right in my face I needed a couple

4865
02:56:11,260 --> 02:56:14,978
inches away from my nose so they can see

4866
02:56:13,478 --> 02:56:16,369
where I'm putting the DAP I'd only go

4867
02:56:14,978 --> 02:56:18,379
cross-eyed

4868
02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:20,061
all right the important part the most

4869
02:56:18,379 --> 02:56:22,819
important part when you're buying a rig

4870
02:56:20,060 --> 02:56:24,860
is the nail that's what you're heating

4871
02:56:22,819 --> 02:56:26,539
up to a couple hundred degrees that's

4872
02:56:24,860 --> 02:56:27,950
what you're putting your extract on it's

4873
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:30,561
gonna be heated and cooled and he didn't

4874
02:56:27,950 --> 02:56:31,400
cold all the time excuse me I'm burping

4875
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:40,310
here I'm gonna take a drink right quick

4876
02:56:31,399 --> 02:56:42,829
excuse me all right I apologize for the

4877
02:56:40,310 --> 02:56:45,199
silence I needed a drink so get a good

4878
02:56:42,829 --> 02:56:47,239
quality titanium nail the only brand I

4879
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:49,579
will recommend for titanium is

4880
02:56:47,239 --> 02:56:51,379
highly-educated titanium they make a

4881
02:56:49,579 --> 02:56:53,090
nail for your ring no matter what you're

4882
02:56:51,379 --> 02:56:55,159
trying to do highly-educated

4883
02:56:53,090 --> 02:56:57,139
has got the perfect nail for you I

4884
02:56:55,159 --> 02:56:58,819
promise if you need guidance on the nail

4885
02:56:57,139 --> 02:57:02,539
hit me up send me a picture of your rig

4886
02:56:58,819 --> 02:57:05,930
I'll tell you what kind of nail to buy I

4887
02:57:02,540 --> 02:57:07,521
do really like the quartz nails if you

4888
02:57:05,930 --> 02:57:10,220
get a good quality quartz nail

4889
02:57:07,521 --> 02:57:12,290
I recommend the Heylin honey hole if you

4890
02:57:10,219 --> 02:57:14,629
do big fat dabs if you're into smoking

4891
02:57:12,290 --> 02:57:16,550
solvent less and BHO definitely get the

4892
02:57:14,629 --> 02:57:17,989
honey hole it holds a lot of heat for

4893
02:57:16,549 --> 02:57:19,609
when you smoke solve it list it's got a

4894
02:57:17,989 --> 02:57:22,069
lot of room to get a big solvent less

4895
02:57:19,610 --> 02:57:25,010
dab in there I also like the clave

4896
02:57:22,069 --> 02:57:26,659
banger the clave banger is gonna be a

4897
02:57:25,010 --> 02:57:29,989
little bit pricey but they are awesome

4898
02:57:26,659 --> 02:57:31,670
they taste super clean who just made the

4899
02:57:29,989 --> 02:57:33,530
trough was that Joe Halen they just made

4900
02:57:31,670 --> 02:57:35,960
the trough I've not had a chance to try

4901
02:57:33,530 --> 02:57:37,640
the trough yet but they look amazing if

4902
02:57:35,959 --> 02:57:40,629
it's made out of good quality quartz I

4903
02:57:37,639 --> 02:57:44,209
bet it's gonna be a good quartz banger

4904
02:57:40,629 --> 02:57:45,709
there is a company that is selling they

4905
02:57:44,209 --> 02:57:47,899
call them quartz bangers it's the nail

4906
02:57:45,709 --> 02:57:49,250
that it's quartz it looks like a faucets

4907
02:57:47,899 --> 02:57:50,810
about kind of with a little bucket at

4908
02:57:49,250 --> 02:57:53,479
the end of it they put your dab in the

4909
02:57:50,810 --> 02:57:54,920
bucket part guys there's a company

4910
02:57:53,479 --> 02:57:56,930
that's selling those that's claiming

4911
02:57:54,920 --> 02:57:58,760
their quartz in their glass be careful

4912
02:57:56,930 --> 02:57:59,930
you don't want to buy glass and reheat

4913
02:57:58,760 --> 02:58:01,101
it and let it cool and reheat it let it

4914
02:57:59,930 --> 02:58:03,760
cool it's gonna break you want a good

4915
02:58:01,101 --> 02:58:05,800
quartz piece quartz can handle the ship

4916
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:07,239

point here also recently I discovered

4928
02:58:28,390 --> 02:58:33,069
something that the people in Colorado

4929
02:58:29,771 --> 02:58:35,950
may be excited about occasionally kind

4930
02:58:33,069 --> 02:58:38,260
love in Denver has occasionally been

4931
02:58:35,950 --> 02:58:40,960
putting out clones of my lemon Geoffrey

4932
02:58:38,260 --> 02:58:42,550
they were I've actually bought seeds

4933
02:58:40,959 --> 02:58:44,500
from me at an event they bought several

4934
02:58:42,549 --> 02:58:46,270
packages of seeds and they ran the lemon

4935
02:58:44,500 --> 02:58:48,370
Geoffrey and they found their phenotypes

4936
02:58:46,271 --> 02:58:52,000
that are killer I've seen the lab tests

4937
02:58:48,370 --> 02:58:53,230
they've tested from the 24 to 26 s and

4938
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,579
they actually said that they could have

4939
02:58:53,229 --> 02:58:56,020
grown the herb better but there was an

4940
02:58:54,579 --> 02:58:58,479
issue so that means that next time

4941
02:58:56,021 --> 02:59:00,521
you're gonna see 28 to 29 percent on the

4942
02:58:58,479 --> 02:59:02,560
limit Geoffrey from kind love so

4943
02:59:00,521 --> 02:59:04,271
occasionally you can pick up lemon

4944
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:05,770
Geoffrey clones and kind love and they

4945
02:59:04,271 --> 02:59:07,960
are beautiful I've seen pictures of them

4946
02:59:05,771 --> 02:59:09,820
their big fat healthy luscious clones I

4947
02:59:07,959 --> 02:59:12,219
definitely recommend that call before

4948
02:59:09,819 --> 02:59:13,840
you drive they will not reserve a clone

4949
02:59:12,219 --> 02:59:15,489
for you so you have to call you have to

4950
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:16,750
say do they have this clone and if they

4951
02:59:15,489 --> 02:59:18,159
say yes then you got to get in the car

4952
02:59:16,750 --> 02:59:19,659
and haul ass over there because they

4953
02:59:18,159 --> 02:59:22,899
will not reserve a clone for you but

4954
02:59:19,659 --> 02:59:24,940
they might have it all right I feel like

4955
02:59:22,899 --> 02:59:26,681

want to talk about some news like I said

4977
03:00:04,021 --> 03:00:08,311
but to lead into the news I want to talk

4978
03:00:06,091 --> 03:00:10,110
a little bit about a comedy show that I

4979
03:00:08,310 --> 03:00:12,091
went to recently Clint and I were

4980
03:00:10,110 --> 03:00:14,341
bragging that we got to go see the

4981
03:00:12,091 --> 03:00:16,501
taping of Doug loves movies which is one

4982
03:00:14,341 --> 03:00:18,631
of my favorite podcasts

4983
03:00:16,501 --> 03:00:20,130
Doug Benson is a weed comedian he does a

4984
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:23,600
show called Doug loves movies where they

4985
03:00:20,130 --> 03:00:26,609
play games he usually brings three

4986
03:00:23,601 --> 03:00:27,810
comedians or some level of superstars to

4987
03:00:26,610 --> 03:00:30,060
the show with him and they are his

4988
03:00:27,810 --> 03:00:31,470
contestants and they play for the

4989
03:00:30,060 --> 03:00:33,289
audience in the audience will win the

4990
03:00:31,470 --> 03:00:36,029
prize is based on who wins in the crowd

4991
03:00:33,290 --> 03:00:38,070

4992
03:00:36,030 --> 03:00:39,751

4996
03:00:45,601 --> 03:00:51,239

5036
03:02:25,409 --> 03:02:29,431
get a VIP seat in the front row let them

5037
03:02:28,290 --> 03:02:30,480
know how many of us there will be and

5038
03:02:29,431 --> 03:02:32,880
they'll put me in the front row as long

5039
03:02:30,479 --> 03:02:34,439
as I've got tickets so I called ahead I

5040
03:02:32,879 --> 03:02:36,930
made arrangements to have my front-row

5041
03:02:34,440 --> 03:02:40,200
privileges I was told that's cool

5042
03:02:36,931 --> 03:02:42,989
we got to the club and when it was time

5043
03:02:40,200 --> 03:02:44,341
to seat us the seating people kind of

5044
03:02:42,989 --> 03:02:46,890
looked at each other with some concern

5045
03:02:44,341 --> 03:02:49,860
and the one guy said you [ __ ] up you

5046
03:02:46,890 --> 03:02:50,609
go tell him so the one seating person I

5047
03:02:49,860 --> 03:02:51,810
don't know what he's called I'm gonna

5048
03:02:50,610 --> 03:02:53,551
call him an usher that sounds about

5049
03:02:51,810 --> 03:02:55,619
right but the one huh sure dude had to

5050
03:02:53,550 --> 03:02:57,629
go tell two people that they had to move

5051
03:02:55,620 --> 03:03:00,120
because the seats that they were sitting

5052
03:02:57,629 --> 03:03:04,140
in up front had been reserved for Doug's

5053
03:03:00,120 --> 03:03:06,181
VIP special guests I felt bad for that

5054
03:03:04,140 --> 03:03:07,800
because those people probably waited in

5055
03:03:06,181 --> 03:03:09,960
line for a good hour while I was at the

5056
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:13,439
mellow mushroom eating pizza or in the

5057
03:03:09,959 --> 03:03:14,579
car taking fat dabs all I'm thinking

5058
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:16,801
about it shoutout to Claude the candy

5059
03:03:14,579 --> 03:03:18,329
man I ate a sweet stone kandi Claudia

5060
03:03:16,800 --> 03:03:19,680
bare before I went into the show about

5061
03:03:18,329 --> 03:03:23,521
two hours before the show and by

5062
03:03:19,681 --> 03:03:25,649
Showtime I was sweet stoned for sure

5063
03:03:23,521 --> 03:03:29,070
so they had to go and move these two

5064
03:03:25,649 --> 03:03:31,529
people because I've got this VIP pass so

5065
03:03:29,069 --> 03:03:33,300
they sit Clint and I and the most prime

5066
03:03:31,530 --> 03:03:35,311
[ __ ] seats in the club right up front

5067
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:37,199
and it's kind of awkward I could feel

5068
03:03:35,310 --> 03:03:40,409
hatred people were staring at us like we

5069
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:41,851
were huge dicks and then eventually the

5070
03:03:40,409 --> 03:03:43,110
guy sitting next to us got tired of the

5071
03:03:41,851 --> 03:03:46,261
tension and he just said so who the [ __ ]

5072
03:03:43,110 --> 03:03:47,641
are you guys and Clint said nobody I'm

5073
03:03:46,261 --> 03:03:48,931
with him and they're like who are you

5074
03:03:47,640 --> 03:03:50,279
and I was like we're just friends of

5075
03:03:48,931 --> 03:03:51,780
Doug's and they said yeah they moved our

5076
03:03:50,280 --> 03:03:54,329
friends because you guys are Doug

5077
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:56,750
special guests and I felt kind of like a

5078
03:03:54,329 --> 03:03:59,159
[ __ ] for that so we do apologize but

5079
03:03:56,750 --> 03:04:01,319
had a great ass time up front that was a

5080
03:03:59,159 --> 03:04:02,489
good ass show let's go and read this

5081
03:04:01,319 --> 03:04:03,869
article I've been talking for a long

5082
03:04:02,489 --> 03:04:06,750
time about it and I've just got an

5083
03:04:03,870 --> 03:04:09,391
article written I was excited because

5084
03:04:06,750 --> 03:04:10,860
what Doug does dude excuse all the

5085
03:04:09,390 --> 03:04:13,219

5157
03:06:45,190 --> 03:06:48,670
person that they invited because my

5184
03:07:36,549 --> 03:07:41,379
watching the lights light up anyway this

5185
03:07:39,819 --> 03:07:43,869
one hits close to home because I do live

5186
03:07:41,379 --> 03:07:46,569
in Pueblo Colorado I am actually the

5187
03:07:43,870 --> 03:07:49,480
grower at a very popular dispensary in

5188
03:07:46,569 --> 03:07:52,569
Pueblo West Colorado Pueblo West is like

5189
03:07:49,479 --> 03:07:54,250
a sub development just outside of the

5190
03:07:52,569 --> 03:07:54,699
city of Pueblo it's about 10 minutes to

5191
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:56,860
the west

5192
03:07:54,700 --> 03:07:59,891
obviously it's Pueblo West it's a little

5193
03:07:56,860 --> 03:08:01,900
nicer it's exactly complete a little

5194
03:07:59,890 --> 03:08:04,270
completely a little nicer it's newer so

5195
03:08:01,899 --> 03:08:05,500
it doesn't have old town problems it

5196
03:08:04,271 --> 03:08:08,311
doesn't have the old rickety parts of

5197
03:08:05,500 --> 03:08:09,780
town so it looks a lot nicer

5198
03:08:08,310 --> 03:08:11,431
we also have a part that we call the

5199
03:08:09,780 --> 03:08:13,771
county which if you drive outside of

5200
03:08:11,431 --> 03:08:16,079
city limits there are a lot of stores

5201
03:08:13,771 --> 03:08:18,000
and shopping areas in the county and the

5202
03:08:16,079 --> 03:08:20,959
county and Pueblo West are allowed to

5203
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:24,450

5204
03:08:20,959 --> 03:08:25,890

residents filled the city council

5221
03:08:57,360 --> 03:09:00,810
chambers Monday night many wearing

5222
03:08:59,190 --> 03:09:02,221
yellow shirts that said voice your

5223
03:09:00,810 --> 03:09:05,329
choice and urging their elected

5224
03:09:02,220 --> 03:09:07,439
officials to put the issue to voters

5225
03:09:05,329 --> 03:09:09,390

5226
03:09:07,440 --> 03:09:11,551
vote in favor of licensing retail pot

5227
03:09:09,390 --> 03:09:13,949
shops but said that he hasn't opposed a

5228
03:09:11,550 --> 03:09:15,359
vote in November several of the six

5229
03:09:13,950 --> 03:09:17,011
council members who voted against

5230
03:09:15,360 --> 03:09:18,271
adopting the ordinance had been in favor

5231
03:09:17,011 --> 03:09:20,881
before the public hearing including

5232
03:09:18,271 --> 03:09:23,460
President Steve Nawrocki excuse me guys

5233
03:09:20,880 --> 03:09:25,789
I'm sorry he said there isn't the issue

5234
03:09:23,459 --> 03:09:29,789
isn't worth dividing the public over

5235
03:09:25,790 --> 03:09:31,851
they did vote and they did decide to

5236
03:09:29,790 --> 03:09:34,440
push back the vote there will be no

5237
03:09:31,851 --> 03:09:37,200
recreational or medical marijuana shops

5238
03:09:34,440 --> 03:09:40,591
in the city of Pueblo until they vote

5239
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:41,881
again which will be in November so you

5240
03:09:40,591 --> 03:09:44,159
guys if you live in Pueblo

5241
03:09:41,880 --> 03:09:46,739
you have to drive 15 minutes to the

5242
03:09:44,159 --> 03:09:48,750
county or to Pueblo West to go purchase

5243
03:09:46,739 --> 03:09:51,030
your cannabis and then drive back and

5244
03:09:48,750 --> 03:09:52,560
then the city that you live in isn't

5245
03:09:51,030 --> 03:09:55,230
getting your tax money for the cannabis

5246
03:09:52,560 --> 03:09:56,940
that you're able to purchase because of

5247
03:09:55,229 --> 03:09:59,289
these stupid [ __ ] regulations that

5248
03:09:56,940 --> 03:10:01,390
Pablo's been juggling with

5249
03:09:59,290 --> 03:10:05,050
I've been in the legal medical marijuana

5250
03:10:01,389 --> 03:10:06,459
industry in this city since should we

5251
03:10:05,049 --> 03:10:07,898
had the first shop I think that was nine

5252
03:10:06,459 --> 03:10:11,169
years ago when we had Madame our

5253
03:10:07,898 --> 03:10:12,909
downtown and since that is closed there

5254
03:10:11,170 --> 03:10:14,469
has not been another medical shop or a

5255
03:10:12,909 --> 03:10:15,939
recreational shop in the city that was

5256
03:10:14,469 --> 03:10:17,679
legally licensed there have been places

5257
03:10:15,939 --> 03:10:20,260
that popped up randomly and we're closed

5258
03:10:17,680 --> 03:10:21,909
but I think it's kind of [ __ ] I

5259
03:10:20,260 --> 03:10:23,469
shouldn't use the word [ __ ] that's

5260
03:10:21,909 --> 03:10:25,209
mean to the [ __ ] people I think it's

5261
03:10:23,469 --> 03:10:27,099
a ridiculous and stupid that we are not

5262
03:10:25,209 --> 03:10:30,459
allowed to have a recreational cannabis

5263
03:10:27,100 --> 03:10:32,559
shop within city limits they need the

5264
03:10:30,459 --> 03:10:34,719
tax money this town is broke and hurtin

5265
03:10:32,559 --> 03:10:38,079

years in federal prison and up to a 1

5344
03:13:22,170 --> 03:13:28,408
million dollar fine per count so my

5345
03:13:25,529 --> 03:13:30,988
point here people is quit mailing weed

5346
03:13:28,408 --> 03:13:33,779
out of Colorado unless you want to end

5347
03:13:30,988 --> 03:13:37,079
up in federal prison doing 20 years and

5348
03:13:33,779 --> 03:13:39,238
facing up to 1 million dollars in fines

5349
03:13:37,079 --> 03:13:40,350
per count there are several reasons we

5350
03:13:39,238 --> 03:13:43,529
shouldn't be mailing cannabis out of

5351
03:13:40,350 --> 03:13:44,790
state you guys first off it's illegal

5352
03:13:43,529 --> 03:13:46,800
and you're gonna go to prison and you're

5353
03:13:44,790 --> 03:13:48,359
gonna get butt raped doesn't sound like

5354
03:13:46,799 --> 03:13:49,978
fun to me doesn't sound like the [ __ ]

5355
03:13:48,359 --> 03:13:52,770
profit I'm making from it not at all

5356
03:13:49,978 --> 03:13:55,408
second of all in Colorado the people

5357
03:13:52,770 --> 03:13:57,869

5358

5361
03:14:01,829 --> 03:14:05,340
small where ever you're sending it

5362
03:14:03,449 --> 03:14:08,010
they're responsible for legalizing

5363
03:14:05,340 --> 03:14:09,869
cannabis in their area not us and by

5364
03:14:08,010 --> 03:14:11,699

writing it based on that we'll get it

5406

episodes away the other episode I have

5408

5410
03:15:41,181 --> 03:15:44,721
improve your garden I've got about 30

5411
03:15:42,681 --> 03:15:48,399
ways written down that could be a long

5412
03:15:44,720 --> 03:15:50,600
episode that is definitely coming I

5413
03:15:48,399 --> 03:15:51,560
don't want to talk too much about any of

5414
03:15:50,601 --> 03:15:52,940
that stuff because we'll just save it

5415
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:54,470
for the actual show I want to give a

5416
03:15:52,940 --> 03:15:57,500
huge shot at again to Clint and Baker

5417
03:15:54,470 --> 03:15:59,000
also a big shout out to Comedy Works big

5418
03:15:57,500 --> 03:16:01,370
shout out to everybody who has helped me

5419
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:03,021
deal with not having a car this week or

5420
03:16:01,370 --> 03:16:04,311
this weekend that's been a real pain in

5421
03:16:03,021 --> 03:16:05,870
the ass you guys if we had some plans

5422
03:16:04,310 --> 03:16:08,539
that I had to cancel or rearrange I

5423
03:16:05,870 --> 03:16:10,431
apologize we had a blown transmission my

5424
03:16:08,540 --> 03:16:13,431
Chevrolet's will get me so far but the

5425
03:16:10,431 --> 03:16:15,140
weather has been shitty and I'm stuck so

5426
03:16:13,431 --> 03:16:16,340
you gotta come to me so you want to take

5427
03:16:15,140 --> 03:16:18,470
some dad there if you want to be able to

5428
03:16:16,340 --> 03:16:20,299
podcast you got to come to me I'm gonna

5429
03:16:18,470 --> 03:16:21,979
wrap up the show you guys you pay a lot

5430
03:16:20,299 --> 03:16:24,289
more attention to a 35 40 minutes

5431
03:16:21,979 --> 03:16:26,640
episode than you do those hour shows let

5432
03:16:24,290 --> 03:16:30,900
me know what you think

5433
03:16:26,640 --> 03:16:34,261
yeah go to uh stitcher or iTunes or

5434
03:16:30,899 --> 03:16:36,001
Twitter or Facebook or email me and tell

5435
03:16:34,261 --> 03:16:39,659
me if you prefer the 30-minute episodes

5436
03:16:36,001 --> 03:16:41,399
over the hour-long episodes I think it's

5437
03:16:39,659 --> 03:16:43,290
better when I do two 30-minute episodes

5438
03:16:41,399 --> 03:16:45,120
instead of the long hour and you guys

5439
03:16:43,290 --> 03:16:46,560
really listen more my throat doesn't

5440

5441
03:16:46,560 --> 03:16:50,310
go an hour but it's just me I'm gonna

5442
03:16:48,870 --> 03:16:52,260
try to go about 30 and try to do two

5443
03:16:50,310 --> 03:16:53,851
episodes a week it's better for

5444
03:16:52,261 --> 03:16:55,560
everybody that way in my opinion let me

5445
03:16:53,851 --> 03:16:58,200

5446
