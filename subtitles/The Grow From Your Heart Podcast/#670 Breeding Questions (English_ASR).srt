00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,478
grower running semi stealth in three

167
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
tenths uh that's as stealth as it's

168
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,839
gonna get bro uh four tenths makes it

169
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,079
not stealth because the electricity bill

170
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,318
gets too high then it says i wanna try

171
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,800
to not only save my genetics but start

172
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,960
trying to find different cultivars that

173
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,240
will get you uh give me a nice buzz with

174
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,519
a good head high that's not what he

175
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,519
typed but that's what i'm going to say

176
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,879
here i think we're still in the nice boy

177
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,318
clock if you know what i mean if you

178
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,759
know anything about the nice boy clock

179
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,600
big fist bump and big shout out to the

180
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,520
nice boy clock

181
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,919
it goes on it says i want a nice buzz

182
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,399
with a good head high as well as a line

183
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,399
geared toward more fighting cancer and

184
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,239
inflammation and pain so you need

185
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,560
something a cultivar that will give you

186
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,199
a good head buzz

187
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,000
and a good head high and you want

188
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,759
something that oh and as well as fight

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,839
cancer and inflammation and pain so

190
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,479
something i i don't i'm not not the

191
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,079
expert on cannabis for cancer i don't

192
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,918
know exactly what you need for that most

193
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,519
of the time we just mix a bunch of

194
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,879
things together and make an rso or

195
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,839
something like that like i said i'm not

196
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,439
the expert on cannabis for cancer uh

197
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,038
fortunately i haven't had to fight that

198
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,199
and experience that or deal with that

199
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,639
yet uh but for inflammation and pain

200
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,720
there are a lot of great strains that'll

201
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,639
do that uh so it goes on it says so i've

202
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,400
got kind of a two-part question really

203
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,038
number one if i wanted to use some of

204
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,198
your genetics as a base of my seeds

205
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,519
after research and selection do i need

206
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,520
to seek your permission and after

207
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,519
strains are honed okay so that's a

208
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,279
two-part question in the first question

209
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,959
then after the seeds after the strains

210
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,799
are honed would you ever want some of

211
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,399
those seeds to work with and then he

212
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,038
says i'm expecting at least three years

213
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,198
minimum uh three years is probably the

214
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,800
long track those f1 seeds will be cool

215
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,759
you can send me some of the f1s that'll

216
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,918
take uh 170 days maybe to make those

217
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,199
maybe like 120 150 days to throw out a

218
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,799
small batch of those you could send me

219
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,919
some of those and they'll be cool

220
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,520
um

221
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,279
the main part of the question if i

222
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,399
wanted to use some of your genetics as a

223
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,318
base for a few of my seeds

224
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,120
do i have to seek your permission

225
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
you can use my seeds and my crosses as

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,199
your base

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,680
but it would be cooler if you used

228
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,840
one side of your cross as your base

229
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,519
don't use the male and the female like

230
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,439
if you're gonna use a couple of my

231
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,918
females in a different male that's cool

232
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,399
but don't use just like my arise and my

233
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,000
strawberry starburst or my uh i don't

234
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,758
know don't do two of my things don't do

235
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,918
don't do blueberry butcher and sun kiss

236
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
because those are both mine uh that

237
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,198
would be cool but that i could do that

238
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
that's kind of that's like taking a

239
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,759
ferrari and another kind of ferrari and

240
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,439
just making ferrari your version do some

241
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,680
different sort of work to it to make it

242
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,360
yours i appreciate and respect that you

243
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,199
love my work enough to want to put it

244
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,520
into your breeding but there's got to be

245
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,598
another breeder out there that inspires

246
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,680
you or encourages you and you could use

247
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,000
their work to kind of mix with mine if

248
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,519
you really want to do uh both of mine

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,879
just for your own personal seed

250
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,639
collection that's not a big deal but if

251
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,240
these seeds are going to go anywhere i'd

252
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,639
recommend that you use somebody else's

253
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,918
line um and it sounds like you're just

254
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,439
trying to save your own stuff so you can

255
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,439
do whatever you want with them yeah

256
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,600
though if you're going to market the

257
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,600
idea the etiquette would be to use two

258
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,519
different breeders make your own male

259
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,959
and then use that male for breeding and

260
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,080
marketing your own stuff but it sounds

261
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,958
like you just want to make these for

262
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,800
your own stash yes in that case bro use

263
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,439
mine to do whatever you want have a good

264
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,120
old time and send me some of the f1s

265
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
maybe i'll work with those and send you

266
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
something back or send me some of the

267
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,799
f2s and same story maybe we'll do things

268
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,080
you never know maybe i'll fall in love

269
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,519
with what you've sent me and i want to

270
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,440
breed to it also and then you'll end up

271
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,959
with some great seeds in return there

272
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,720
have been some great exchanges happening

273
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,319
within the group here lately so big

274
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,080
shout out to everybody uh for being so

275
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,920
generous lately also

276
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
uh but yes you do have my permission you

277
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,599
don't need to specifically seek my

278
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,278
permission to breed with my seeds but

279
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,720
since you asked about it

280
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,320
you've got my full permission and

281
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,120
encouragement and endorsement to breed

282
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,720
with my seeds i didn't invent cannabis i

283
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,879
didn't invent seeds i didn't invent

284
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,839
nature uh whatever you believe in if

285
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,240
it's uh sunra if it's ja rastafari if

286
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,839
you believe in uh zoom if you believe in

287
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,360
water bottle is your god i'm cool with

288
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
that you could believe in whatever you

289
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,519
want i have no problem with that but

290
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,959
that's what created seeds and that's

291
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,240
that's who we've got to be grateful for

292
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,639
so i'm breeding with some of their

293
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,039
projects we all are i didn't pull seeds

294
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,399
out of thin air i didn't manifest them

295
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,240
they didn't pop out of my computer

296
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,679
screen i had to get seeds from somewhere

297
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,159
and use somebody else's either their

298
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,078
seeds or clones to start my growing

299
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,159
breeding seed project

300
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,639
so i give you my permission to do the

301
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,278
same with my genetics too because i

302
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,319
would be arrogant and uh disrespectful

303
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:18,559
of me to the entire industry community

304
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,399
breeders before me and breeders after me

305
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,119
to say no you can't use my stuff that's

306
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,600
a [ __ ] move uh i have to treat it

307
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
like uh i'm proud you respect my

308
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,879
genetics and appreciate it enough and

309
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,959
i'm proud to have made something and

310
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,360
honored that you want to continue my

311
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,119
work i've said it before i'm not going

312
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
to live forever i don't want to i don't

313
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,159
i'm not planning anything i ain't got no

314
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,319
[ __ ] plans but i know i won't live

315
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,559
forever i'm not going to do anything on

316
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,000
purpose but i could disappear i could

317
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,278
take in a wrong breath right now and

318
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,200
this could be the end of it like right

319
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,159
now or i could live another 20 or 30

320
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
maybe 40 years yeah maybe 40 or 50 more

321
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,399
years after that it's going to get

322
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
uncomfortable and we'll have to think

323
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,759
about things but uh once i'm gone i want

324
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,160
the people left to be working with my

325
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,360
strains and i want to have taught them

326
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,199
what i want to make everybody

327

everybody but parts of that's up and

334
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,880
most of the beatles are dead and their

335
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,399
music lives on forever that stuff goes

336
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,320
elvis is dead that's a good example

337
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,078
elvis is dead and people are still

338
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
listening to elvis right now elvis lives

339
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,879
on elvis is still making more money than

340
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,278
most of us

341
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,360
and the dude is dead so um i hope that

342
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,120
my brand lives on my little stickers

343
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,120

will be up indefinitely unless somebody

349
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,958
[ __ ] flags my account or something

350
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,879
when i'm dead and then i don't give a

351
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,159
[ __ ] you guys could deal with it but um

352

yeah i'm not going to be here forever so

353
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,759
i do encourage you

354
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,599
to make some legacy seeds you never know

355
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,439
i'm breeding with rest in peace i'm

356
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,519
breeding with my friend subcool stuff

357
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,839
subcool was kind of a mentor and a

358
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,440
teacher and an inspiration and an idol

359
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,279
to me subcool paved the way without

360
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,920
subcool i wouldn't be doing it so

361
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,679
recently uh with miss jill's permission

stuff is out there going on then people

381
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,319
are gonna breed to that and then people

382
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
are gonna breed to that and then my name

383
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
will continue sub cool's name will

384
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,759

385
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,160
in this cannabis game for a long long

386
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,759
time so i do give you my permission got

387
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,439

388
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,799
my buddy sub cool shout out toby you

lot you guys you have no idea uh some of

391
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,839
the message because sometimes sub would

392
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,838
be like are you a [ __ ] idiot and if

393

that kind of [ __ ] when it's gone uh

404
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,200
there is a two part to this question i

405
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,439
got rambly thinking about subby bigger

406
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
specs up um

407
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,440
you can tinker as [ __ ] i hope the nice

408
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,278
boy clock is over then it goes on it

409
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,440
says do you have any kind of classic

410
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,399
land race style genetics to use as a

411
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,519
parent to really create my own library

412
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,639
which you would recommend uh no i don't

413
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,839
mess with land races that is ah that's a

414
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,240
whole nother uh niche what is it alley

415
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,000
avenue of breeding nerds and i'm being

416
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,000
completely respectful when i'm saying

417
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,839
breeding nerds when i talk about

418
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,839
breeding there are guys like myself who

419
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,680
are passionate about breeding i love

420
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,839
cannabis i love growing i love teaching

421
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,239
i love breeding i love

422
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,000
selecting a male and pollinating females

423
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
and watching how the females react and

424
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,078
then in the end i get to grow those

425
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,000
seeds and watch the seeds and see like

426
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,919
if i pollinated two different females

427
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
with one male i get to see what that boy

428
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,919
added to the mix and how the female

429
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,360
plants represent that males pollen and

430
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,759
how they express themselves in the

431
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,879
progeny and i'm completely passionate

432
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,120
about growing cannabis and i'm

433
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,639
completely passionate about breeding

434
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,120
but those land race nerds are a step

435
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,240
above my passion and a step above my

436
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,039
nerdiness

437
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,039
they

438
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,480
they know so i know the genetics of what

439
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,719
everything i'm working with is the

440
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,159
grandparents it's parents it's recessive

441
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,639
traits it's dominant traits it's

442
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,559
flowering time it's terps uh how much it

443
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,720
wants to be fed i know so much about my

444
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,759
plants but these land race guys they

445
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,040
know from which geographical location it

446
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,958
came from they can tell you the

447
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,519
coordinates on the globe like well that

448
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,679
came from this here in like this part of

449
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,000
africa and this valley found by this guy

450
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,838
from this tribe and i'm like holy [ __ ]

451
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,480
man i love it it is beautiful but that

452
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,600
is another level of nerdum that i

453
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,039
haven't uh delved into yet and you you

454
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,879
uh land race nerds i'm not being

455
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,480
disrespectful by calling you land race

456
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,799
seed nerds you get what i'm saying i'm a

457
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,039
breeding nerd i'm a weed nerd as well

458
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,120
the land race guys take it to another

459
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,639
freaking level it's like there's uh

460
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,799
there's musicians right i'm a rock and

461
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,480
roll musician i i can read and write

462
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,758
music but that's not my thing let's get

463
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,519
out there and just rock and roll play

464
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,278
some 404 classic rock and roll kind of

465
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,720
[ __ ] then you got those guys that sit

466
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,159
there with the music in front of them

467
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,560
and they can read the charts and they've

468
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,399
got seven other pieces around them all

469
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,799
reading charts and nobody varies one

470
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,879
note or one piece of tempo one tempo

471
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,479
shift at all today that's what the land

472
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,240
race nerds are like they're like the

473
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,519
extra level and i love them i got

474
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,480
nothing but respect for you guys but

475
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,799
that is a whole nother level um i don't

476
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,159
even know who to recommend for land race

477
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,919
genetics i have a couple of friends that

478
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,078
work with that stuff but they're not

479
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,599
really that the land race guys aren't

480
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,039
out there to make a bunch of seeds for

481
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,639
the world they're just doing kind of

482
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,399
like yourself they're doing their own

483
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,480
closet project because they really want

484
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,919
to do some crazy breeding and find

485
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,920
really unique [ __ ] that land race

486
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,198
breeding will be fun for you that will

487
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,639

00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,599
know what some of those common crosses

527
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,400
have already been bred to make a lot of

528
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,719
the old school super popular crosses uh

529
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,200
will be like a brazilian thai afghani

530
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,038
cross or something similar to that and

531
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,759
they weren't labeled all super crazy it

532
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:50,000
wasn't bubble gum to magic pony ride to

533
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,000
magic mustache to [ __ ] fruity pebbles

534
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,599
it wasn't any of that it was tied to

535
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,279
afghani is what they used to be called

536
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,678
and they'd cross the tie to afghani to a

537
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,519
mexican and then cross that to something

538
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,080
else and that's what they called it thai

539
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,079
afghan mexican you have a tam or a thai

540
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,480
afghan brazilian and you'd have a tab

541
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,678
but that's how it used to be so uh i

542
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,679
would recommend you go search the

543
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,360
websites and then just type in land race

544
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,679
genetics and if nothing from the

545
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:16,240
recommended breeders on my website gets

546
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,320
you any luck then go to google and start

547

554
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,279
that's got them but the reason i'm

555
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,879
saying not saying right away go to

556
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,599
google is because i think we can find

557
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,600
you trusted resources by uh operating

558
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,480
through my website my channels my

559
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,399
website all those vendors are accredited

560
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,400
uh they've been vetted they're tried and

561
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,240
true i know they're reliable everybody

562
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,679
on discord they're cool as [ __ ] and if

563
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,679
not they get kicked out of the discord

564
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,360
we don't let any [ __ ] [ __ ] or

565
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
with a small exception then sometimes

566
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,399
there's some dipshit's [ __ ] in there

567
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,000
but they've got redeeming qualities

568
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,440
they're only like three to seven percent

569
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,880
[ __ ] or [ __ ] so we let them hang

570
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,519
out they're maybe they're funny or

571
