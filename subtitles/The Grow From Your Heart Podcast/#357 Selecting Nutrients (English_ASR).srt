00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,160
letting you know what I'm smoking today

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,050
I'm taking dabs of fat so to live batter

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,320
from Green Dot labs this is a

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,330
combination of GMO and legend OG on the

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,600
package it is described as dark roast

14
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:35,009
coffee garlic and fuel I would

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,350
absolutely agree with that description

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,628
but I may add a little bit of underarms

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,030
and onions to that description there's

18
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:43,949
kind of a rank after smell to this that

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,140
I know it sounds disgusting but it is

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,550
really inviting if I opened up this

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,829
concentrate and let you smell you'd go

22
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,530
oh that is gross can I have a DAB and

23
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,170
then when you dab it it leaves this

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,390
really savory aftertaste that I really

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,219
enjoy and it also gives me crazy

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,409
cottonmouth I haven't had a concentrate

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,500
give me Cod mouth like that in a long

28
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,959
time it's also got a really nice heavy

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,280
high it set me back in the chair it made

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,569
me just kind of sit here and stare into

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,549
the computer screen for a couple of

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,109
seconds before I started recording it's

33
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,689
got a really nice buzz and I really

34
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:18,509
enjoy the fat so to live batter from

35
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:20,639

nutrients if you're a new listener if

44
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,328
there that will give you a solid

45
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,790
foundation on setting goals for your

46
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,709
grow selecting your space and selecting

47
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,420
your equipment for the grow if you're an

48
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,789
experienced grower or if you've been

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,450
listening let's get right into selecting

50
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,520
nutrients for your new grow selecting

51
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,950
nutrients or fertilizers for your new

52
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,069
garden can be very challenging it can

53
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,600
also be very intimidating nutrients and

54
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,379
fertilizers are the most heavily

55
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,699
advertised product in the gross store

56
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:07,560
after you have the grow set up your

57
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,110
nutrients will probably be the most

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,870
expensive recurring cost you have in

59
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,920
your grow I'm going to do my best to

60
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,140
guide you on

61
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,089
electing nutrients without recommending

62
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,098
specific brands without recommending

63
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,959
specific products I'm trying not to

64
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,238
pitch anything here I'm not trying to

65
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,370
steer you any specific direction but I

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
want to give you a good idea and a good

67
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,330
understanding of what to think about

68
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,269
when you were trying to customize your

69
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,920
garden for yourself there are thousands

70
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,560
of nutrient companies out there and

71
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,139
countless ways to amend and fertilize

72
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,870
soil it may take a little bit of trial

73
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:46,018
and error to dial in what works best for

74
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,580
you don't be afraid to run one nutrient

75
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,230
brand for your first grow and a

76
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,300
completely different line for your

77
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:52,829
second grow take notes when you do

78
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,930
things like that and then you can

79
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,310
compare what you liked better maybe one

80
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,290
nutrient company will give you better

81
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,818
flavors one nutrient company is gonna

82
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:01,979
give you better yields and one will

83
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,659
probably give you better potency if you

84
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,548
can find the company that does all three

85
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:08,370
of those and works with your gross style

86
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:10,590
that's what you want to do also the

87
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,959
cannabis industry is filled with egos

88
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,849
don't let anybody tell you you were

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,830
choosing the wrong line because it's not

90
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,959
what they choose as long as you are

91
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,579
satisfied with the outcome and you are

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,680
okay with the ethics of the company

93
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:25,049
we're giving your money to you can use

94
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,230
whatever nutrients you want that is the

95
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,489
beauty of building your own grow now

96
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:31,889
let's talk about some of the options

97
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,560
when it comes to selecting nutrients for

98
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,149
our grow when you go to the gross store

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,239
the number one thing they're going to

100
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,700
pitch to you is bottled nutrients gross

101
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,200
stores love to sell bottled nutrients

102
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,479
there are different types of bottled

103
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,328
nutrients available we've got salt based

104
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,209
bottled nutrients most of your big brand

105
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,640
names are salt based there are also

106
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,229
organic bottled nutrients available a

107
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,419
lot of companies boast about having

108
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:57,988
fully organic lines that's always an

109
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,169
option

110
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,480
also there are veganic options available

111
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:06,539
which means there are no animal products

112
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,879
and an organic lineup and of course we

113
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,500
can always do a combination of organics

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,180
and synthetics there's always a nice

115
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,979
balance to find there and make sure that

116
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,019
none of our synthetic salt based

117
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,839
nutrients are going to destroy anything

118
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,668
in our organic nutrients but there is no

119
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,339
problem using them together once you

120
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,439
understand that balance now let's talk

121
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,119
about some of the pros and cons of

122
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,250
bottled nutrients

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,228
a moment ago I said you can choose

124
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,360
whatever brand you like as long as you

125
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:36,029
are comfortable with their ethics now

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,790
what do I mean by that as a consumer it

127
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:40,469
is our responsibility to understand what

128
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,750
the companies we support do with the

129
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,000
money we give them if you don't agree

130
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,259
with the way a company operates if you

131
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,240
don't agree with things that company

132
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,639
supports you do not have to shop with

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,370
that company you vote with your dollars

134
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,500
try to spend your money with a company

135
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,050
who supports cannabis try to keep your

136
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,029
money on our team try not to spend your

137
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,439
money with a company who is unethical

138
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,239
with the company who is slowly

139
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,910
destroying the world with a company who

140
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,860
is slowly poisoning mankind so when it

141
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,720
comes to selecting nutrients do a little

142
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,819
bit of research about the company do

143
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,400
research about their parent company see

144
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,259
who owns that company and find out who's

145
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,149
at the top of the food chain and see who

146
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,889
you're giving your money to I know I

147
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:21,418
just added a whole new step to your

148
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,460
selection process but that is my

149
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:25,319
responsibility is to make you guys think

150
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,579
about stuff like that so think about the

151
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,199
ethics of the company

152
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:30,269
you are spending your money with when

153
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,680
you were selecting your nutrients now

154
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:34,680
let's talk more about the pros and cons

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,930
of bottled nutrients specifically before

156
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,090
we even get started I know the bottle

157
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,668
nutrients are not for everybody but I

158
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,978
also know that amended soils and living

159
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:45,779
soils are not for everybody so if you

160
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:47,788
are a living soil guy if you're an

161
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,619
organic guy I get it you're probably

162
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:51,329
already pulling your hair out saying

163
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,250
Jeff don't recommend bottles to new

164
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:56,129
growers but you've got to keep in mind

165
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,949
not everybody is able to run a no-till

166
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:01,348
grow not everybody is able to set up a

167
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:03,449
living soil system and also some people

168
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:05,639
may just want to do bottled nutrients if

169
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,379
you're a chemistry student or your mind

170
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,000
thinks that way maybe you want a

171
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:10,860
measuring device and a bottle of liquid

172
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,470
to measure and then mix and then balance

173
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,150
the pH maybe that's fun for you if

174
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,680
you're more of a biology student you're

175
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:18,478
more into horticulture and more into the

176
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,000
dirt maybe you want to make the pre

177
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,250
amended soil it's all about doing it

178
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,529
your way and what makes you happy so I'm

179
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,978
gonna start with bottled nutrients the

180
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:30,209
pros to bottled nutrients are they are

181
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:32,189
available you can go to a gross store

182
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:34,560
and they are on the Shelf you can go to

183
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:36,449
Amazon and they are right there one of

184
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,839
the major advantages to bottled

185
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,949
nutrients is that they are available

186
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,099
another advantage to bottle

187
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,879
trance is an available nutrient feeding

188
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,430
schedule

189
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,889
most of the reputable nutrient companies

190
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,410
have a website that includes a nutrient

191
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:54,870
calculator or a nutrient feed schedule

192
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,670
these are really easy to work with you

193
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,800
type in how many weeks you're going to

194
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,960
veg you type in how many weeks are going

195
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,000
to flower and that website makes a

196
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,459
custom nutrient regimen to fit your

197
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,189
schedule so week one of veg it will tell

198
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,319
you week one feed this nutrient at this

199
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:13,769
rate so it'll say week one use your base

200
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,170
nutrients at 25 mils use cal-mag at five

201
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:17,909
mils use whatever else at this mini mils

202
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,980
per gallon of water so you know week one

203
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,840
it's all right here listed out for me

204
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,480
week two what do I need to feed on week

205
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,039
two oh it says 25 mils of this 10 mils

206
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,509
of this and 10 mils of this and it'll

207
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,370
run you all the way through the growth

208
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,409
cycle all the way up to the time you

209
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,759
flush so if you select a brand you buy

210
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,950
their lineup you go to their website

211
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,050
you've got basic instructions on how to

212
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,550
mix that brand for optimal results for

213
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,620
your plants now you will need to dial

214
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,480
that in not all plants are the same but

215
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,459
they give you a pretty good guideline on

216
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,200
how to get started of course those

217
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,299
companies want you to buy more bottles

218
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,539
more frequently so you can always reduce

219
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,270
the recommended dosage maybe 50% maybe

220
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,610
use 75% but there's no need to start off

221
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:58,709
at the whole recommended dosage if you

222
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,449
need more you can add more but you can

223
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,979
never take out once you've burnt the

224
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,139
plants once they're burnt they are

225
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,150
burned so that's my recommendation start

226
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,889
it maybe 50 to 75 percent of the

227
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:10,229
recommended dosage on those schedules

228
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,819
and then increase as needed and as you

229
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,530
get more experience with the plants you

230
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,509
will start to see if they need less or

231
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:18,179
more nutrients so that's a really handy

232
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:20,699
thing they have a nutrient calculator on

233
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,069
the website so learning to grow with

234
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,860
bottles can be very easy because of the

235
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,659
accessibility and these websites another

236
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,900
great thing about bottle nutrients is

237
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,090
easily repeatable results we know

238
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:35,459
exactly what is in each bottle we know

239
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,918
the ratios of each element in there so

240
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,710
if we wrote down how much we fed each

241
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,529
nutrient each feeding time and we also

242
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,300
documented the pH of those feedings we

243
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,699
should be able to have repeatable

244
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,529
results using the same product every

245
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,270
time now you will need similar

246
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,559
environmental factors in the room you'll

247
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,059
need the same temperature and the same

248
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,429
humid

249
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:57,529
and the same VPD but as long as nothing

250
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:59,479
changed too drastically in your grow

251
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,549
room you'll be able to repeat your last

252
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,769
feeding schedule and your crop should

253
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:06,349
come out with similar quality to the

254
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:08,329
last harvest alright those are some of

255
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,950
the pros of working with bottled

256
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,470
nutrients they are readily available

257
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,360
there are nutrient schedules available

258
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,029
there are fairly easy to work with and

259
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,909
they are reliable we know exactly what

260
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:22,959
is in each bottle now let's talk about

261
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:25,669
some of the cons to bottled nutrients

262
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,129
most of the cons to working with bottle

263
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:31,399
nutrients are all related and they are

264
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:33,559
mostly environmental factors first we

265
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,199
have a bunch of plastic bottles that is

266
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,509
environmentally unsustainable then we

267
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,390
are shipping plastic bottles filled with

268
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:43,309
water across the country most of the

269
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:45,980
nutrients we are buying are eighty to

270
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:48,679
ninety percent water so we are basically

271
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,810
paying a truck driver to drive his truck

272
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,389
across the country to haul plastic

273
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:55,519
bottles of water that is completely

274
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,230
unsustainable then once that bottle gets

275
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,600
to us we have it for a couple of weeks

276
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,670
then what do we do we throw away or

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,560
recycle that plastic bottle the

278
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:05,899
recycling center in my area will not

279
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,059
take plastic bottles that had nutrients

280
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,279
or pesticides in them they cannot do it

281
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:12,619
so they have to be thrown away so the

282
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,689
downside is that we are shipping plastic

283
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,970
bottles filled with water and then we're

284
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,520
throwing plastic bottles in a landfill

285
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,710
it's very unsustainable so most of the

286
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,199
reasons to not use bottled nutrients are

287
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,620
environmentally based and sustainability

288
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,720
based so most of the cons to working

289
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,759
with bottled nutrients are environmental

290
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,560
factors another thing to think about is

291
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,870
are you gonna know how to grow when

292
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,119
those bottles go away if the gross store

293
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,860
is too close and society falls apart and

294
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,899
we have to go back to actually farming

295
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,970
are you gonna understand how to farm

296
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,759
your cannabis plants or are you gonna be

297
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,160
stuck reaching for bottles that's where

298
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,980
the organic and the no-till guys really

299
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,600
laugh at the bottle growers so those are

300
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,210
the pros and cons of working with

301
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,850
bottled nutrients when you're shopping

302
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:02,269
for bottled nutrients don't be sold by

303
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,950
cool packaging and fancy logos also when

304
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,629
it comes to selecting nutrients if

305
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,330
you're a new grower I read

306
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:09,980
come in you stick with one brand don't

307
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,320
try to buy base nutrients from one

308
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,360
company cal-mag from another company of

309
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,600
bloom booster from another company this

310
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,190
will lead to problems let me try to

311
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,389
quickly explain why this could become

312
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,940
problematic

313
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:25,039
each company breaks down the required

314
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,740
elements for your plants in different

315
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,870
bottles different packages now some of

316
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,700
these elements can be mixed together in

317
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,169
a bottle and some cannot be mixed

318
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,270
together in bottles so they've got to

319
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:37,669
make two different products some

320
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:39,199
companies want you to buy 30 different

321
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:41,509
bottles so that you can dial in that

322
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,840
makes to have exactly as much nitrogen

323
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:46,519
as you want exactly as much phosphorus

324
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,740
exactly as much potassium while other

325
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,179
companies will mix the nitrogen in one

326
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,789
bottle and the phosphorous and potassium

327
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:55,309
and another bottle they do that because

328
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:57,679
it's easier than having 30 bottles for

329
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:59,839
your nutrient line so each company knows

330
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,549
what is in each product they are putting

331
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,889
out they know that if they put out a

332
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:06,019
base any bloom booster and you use them

333
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,090
together they know they did not double

334
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:11,360
up on any specific element in those two

335
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:13,220
bottles now if you grab a base nutrient

336
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,080
from one brand and a bloom booster from

337
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,060
another brand they never spoke to each

338
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,889
other you may be doubling up and adding

339
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,169
too much of one element to your plants

340
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:23,480
and not even realize it so that's why I

341
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,529
recommend picking one brand and sticking

342
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,850
with it it has nothing to do with

343
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:28,039
loyalty it has nothing to do with

344
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,830
marketing it just has to do with making

345
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,559
sure you do not double up and burn your

346
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,120
plants now I've got one more note about

347
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,879
bottled nutrients I want to discuss

348
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,850
before we move on keep this in mind our

349
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,769
plant requires 16 elements for healthy

350
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,220
growth our plants require carbon

351
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:48,199
hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen now those

352
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,480
come from the air and the water the

353
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,390
nitrogen comes from the air and the soil

354
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:59,060
also our plants want phosphorus

355
00:12:53,389 --> 00:13:02,750
potassium calcium magnesium sulfur boron

356
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:06,649
chlorine copper iron manganese

357
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:09,019
molybdenum and zinc those are the

358
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:11,120
necessary elements as long as the

359
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:12,769
nutrients you were buying have all of

360
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,860
those required elements you were

361
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:17,389
covering most of your bases of course I

362
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,159
would recommend adding an enzymatic

363
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:21,078
product some sort of enzymes

364
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,509
to help some sort of carbs are going to

365
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:26,059
help and I always recommend some sort of

366
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:29,180
route love some sort of beneficial

367
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:32,119
microbes some mykos beneficial fungus

368
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:34,849
beneficial bacteria for your rhizosphere

369
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,278
now you may also need a PK booster a

370
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,399
bloom booster later and flower but you

371
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,809
don't need a whole bunch of unnecessary

372
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,028
ingredients for your plant as long as

373
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:46,309
you're getting these 16 elements maybe

374
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:48,078
some enzymes maybe some carbs and I

375
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:50,508
would always recommend some sort of a

376
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,338
root inoculant your plants will be happy

377
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,019
don't let the guy at the gross store

378
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,560
sell you stuff because he works on

379
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:56,839
commission

380
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,758
don't let the bottles at the gross store

381
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,529
sell you stuff because they have really

382
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,600
cool logos and they're well advertised

383
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:04,789
when you go to a farm supply store

384
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,730
everything comes in a white bag with

385
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:09,559
black writing and it all works all of

386
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,509
that fancy labeling and packaging is

387
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,179
just something to charge you extra for

388
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,829
so don't fall for it now the next part

389
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:17,688
of my notes says to discuss my

390
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:19,370
experience I try not to talk too much

391
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:21,559
about specific brands in here

392
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,480
so I'm not going to go too far in detail

393
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,849
and I may not even say specific brand

394
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,550
names but you may catch on when I first

395
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,290
started growing I used a very popular

396
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:32,629
brand of nutrients they are that company

397
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:35,568
that has about 40 bottles available

398
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:38,208
I bought all 40 bottles I had a lot of

399
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:40,458
fun mixing and dialing in that mix I did

400
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,750
that stuff for two or three years and I

401
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,328
got really good at it

402
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,889
I was able to pull over two pounds from

403
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:48,620
a normal thousand watt light and an

404
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:51,049
indoor basement grow reliably using this

405
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,299
company's nutrients unfortunately

406
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:56,149
everything I grew with that product

407
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:59,419
tasted and smelled and looked exactly

408
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:59,929
the same if I grew a G Kush and super

409
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:02,058
Lemon Haze

410
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:04,549
in the same room with this nutrient line

411
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:06,948
they would both smell and look fairly

412
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:08,629
similar there would be a lot of weed and

413
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:10,758
it would be really potent but you could

414
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:13,370
barely tell that I grew two different

415
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,230
strains I didn't like that so I switched

416
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,328
to another company it was known to be

417
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,250
their competitor this company still had

418
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:22,099
quite a few bottles but not as many but

419
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,778
this company was not nearly as expensive

420
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,939
as the brand I had tried before so I

421
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:28,039
started using their product I could tell

422
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:29,838
a few weeks in that I was not satisfied

423
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,639
with that product either my plants were

424
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,600
looking colorful I could tell a huge

425
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,329
difference in

426
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,310
varietal but there was not going to be

427
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:39,289
the weight or potency that I'd gotten

428
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:41,059
from the previous brand so that's when I

429
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:43,099
had to get rid of that product and move

430
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:44,750
on to something else I've been doing a

431
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,389
lot of research and I had fallen in love

432
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,009
with botanic air no I know I told you I

433
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,528
wasn't gonna talk about a lot of brands

434
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,289
but botanic air did a really good job

435
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:57,019
for me for a really long time I dialed

436
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:59,120
in a beautiful botanic air recipe with a

437
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:01,490
couple of additives and I grew some of

438
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,528
the best cannabis I have ever smoked

439
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,350
with botanic air nutrients and a few

440
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:08,659
other additives I was ecstatic with my

441
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,759
results from botanic air then I noticed

442
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:13,189
something started changing they were

443
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,810
changing their recipes then one day they

444
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,509
announced that they had sold their

445
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:18,979
company noticing that the recipe was

446
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,659
changing and that my plants weren't as

447
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,789
happy as they had been with that product

448
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:25,278
before already had me looking into

449
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:27,469
another product line I was also working

450
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,480
in commercial grows and experimenting

451
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,269
with other product lines and those grows

452
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,159
being exposed to commercial grows and

453
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:36,350
the options to run so many different

454
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,269
products on so many different levels let

455
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,790
me see what worked and what did not work

456
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:42,409
for me and the way that I grow so

457
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:44,208
knowing that botanic era was changing

458
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:46,039
their recipes and then discovering the

459
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,289
botanic air had sold their brand to AA

460
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,669
thorn who is one of those companies I

461
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:52,879
spoke of earlier that we would rather

462
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:54,708
not support I had to make a change I had

463
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,909
been using a powdered nutrient system

464
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:58,099
and a commercial grower for quite a

465
00:16:55,909 --> 00:17:00,379
while and I was ecstatic with the

466
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,810
results I'd also been learning to use

467
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:05,328
another bottled nutrient system in that

468
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:08,178
grow and I was completely satisfied with

469
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:09,828
their results as well now over time I

470
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:11,720
realized that the powdered nutrient

471
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,730
company was lacking just a couple of

472
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,009
things that I could probably boost up my

473
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,720
production if I added a few things so I

474
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:20,269
took a couple of products from that

475
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,400
bottled nutrient line and added those to

476
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:24,288
my powdered nutrient line and by using

477
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,798
two different nutrient companies I have

478
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:30,558
created a stellar nutrient program for

479
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:32,150
my grow now earlier I did say that I

480
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,308
would recommend you stick to one brand

481
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,750
but once you learn the plants and you

482
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:37,970
learn about the nutrients you'll be able

483
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,829
to customize your mix to as many brands

484
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,990
as you like as long as you understand

485
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:43,699
what's in each bottle now I've been

486
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,589
trying to avoid giving you brand names

487
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,500
and specific product names but I already

488
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:48,179
know I'm going to get a

489
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,039
Gmail's if i don't tell you what i use

490
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,380
so I'm just gonna spill the beans and

491
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,960
tell you that I use veg bloom powdered

492
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,630
nutrients as my base I use veg bloom HD

493
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,819
I also use plus life and when we get

494
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,860
into flower I start adding two grams of

495
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,839
shine and then as we get later into

496
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:05,669
flower I will increase the shine that's

497
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,980
very strange specific I've gotten up to

498
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:10,560
four grams of shine per gallon on some

499
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,960
strains and they love it to the veg blue

500
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,659
mix I also add a little bit of new

501
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,579
millennium products I use the Ruby the

502
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,160
fulvic acid from new millennium and I

503
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,960
also use the carbonaria the carbs from

504
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,150
new millennium so I'm adding a little

505
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,829
fulvic acid to increase uptake I'm

506
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:29,040
adding a little bit of carbs to give

507
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:31,349
more energy then I also add slf 100

508
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,049
enzymes and if the plants show me that

509
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:36,299
they need more cow mag we use Kali magic

510
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:38,669
from gh in a commercial facility and

511
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,460
that is basically my nutrient schedule

512
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:44,370
for a large commercial grow alright

513
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,100
that's my rant on bottled nutrients now

514
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:48,869
let's talk more about amended soils

515
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:50,609
let's talk about super soil let's talk

516
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:53,429
about living soil and we'll kind of

517
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:55,500
touch on no-till environments as well I

518
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,930
don't have as much experience in this

519
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,849
realm so I will not have as many details

520
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,830
for you but I'm sure that I'll be able

521
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:03,269
to give you a good enough breakdown to

522
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:05,189
help you make your decision and

523
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:07,289
selecting your nutrient or you're

524
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,269
fertilizing style for your new garden

525
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:12,389
now let's talk a little bit about what I

526
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:14,940
mean by living soils and super soils

527
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,700
this is a more natural more sustainable

528
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,039
approach your super soil can be as

529
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,160
simple or as elaborate as you want to

530
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:25,980
make it there are a lot of recipes for

531
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,930
usable super soils on lock making your

532
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,000
own living soil can be very easy

533
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,880
you are basically combining dried

534
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,130
amendments with soil or soilless mix and

535
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,790
giving it the proper conditions and time

536
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,530
to cook and become alive the way I would

537
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:42,690
do it is through a large tarp on the

538
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:44,639
garage floor I would put out the amount

539
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,650
of soil that I need I would add all the

540
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,600
dried amendments on top of that I would

541
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,550
use a shovel and/or a pitchfork to stir

542
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,399
that up real nice then once it's all

543
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:54,809
mixed up you add it to a trash can you

544
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,970
may need to add a little bit of moisture

545
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:57,928
to your new concoction just to get the

546
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,400
party started

547
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,028
then you put the lid on the trash can

548
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,979
and

549
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:04,769
store it in a warm area and wait about

550
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:06,629
30 days over time all of those

551
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,759
amendments will start breaking down in

552
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:11,608
that soil and they will create a living

553
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,319
environment in that trash can when you

554
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:16,048
take the lid off of that trash can if

555
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:18,628
you see a white layer of moldy funk on

556
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,999
top of the dirt that is exactly what we

557
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:23,608
are looking for that is life you have

558
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:25,858
created living soil we have basically

559
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:27,778
mimicked what Mother Nature does inside

560
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:29,608
of a small container and we are giving

561
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:31,798
the plants exactly what they would want

562
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:34,138
without force feeding them anything that

563
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,388
they do not want now depending on the

564
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:38,788
mineral content of your newly made soil

565
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:41,579
you may need to add a little bit of

566
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:42,838
uncharged soil to your pots when you're

567
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:45,269
putting new plants in there because that

568
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:46,739
fresh soil may be a little too potent it

569
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:49,019
may be a little too rich and you may

570
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:51,058
need to cut it down to reduce burning

571
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:52,829
your new baby plants so that's something

572
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:55,469
to think about when working with the

573
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:57,989
living soil now let's talk a little bit

574
00:20:55,469 --> 00:21:01,259
about the pros and cons of a living soil

575
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:03,960
environment the main the best part is

576
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,489
that it is organic as long as everything

577
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,338
you put in there is organic

578
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:11,579
you have got an organic grow it is also

579
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:13,558
very sustainable most of those dried

580
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:16,378
amendments come in a box that box is

581
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:18,358
either compostable or recyclable also

582
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:20,368
there's not a bunch of water in that box

583
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:22,108
to ship around so you were getting the

584
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:24,569
product the product goes into the soil

585
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:27,598
the Box goes into recycling there's very

586
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:29,819
minimal waste some of those meals are

587
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:32,308
actually waste products that we are

588
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:34,408
reusing so we are actually recycling and

589
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:36,749
putting a waste product to use by

590
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:39,899
putting it in our garden so that's a

591
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:41,639
huge advantage of living soil situations

592
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:43,918
also when you start running a living

593
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:45,959
soil or an organic garden you will also

594
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,960
probably end up creating a compost bin

595
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,179
in your home which will also create more

596
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,098
environmental awareness which will just

597
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,960
cause a chain reaction once you start

598
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:56,819
growing organically you'll start seeing

599
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,798
things on a more organic level in your

600
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,388
whole life it'll affect your eating it

601
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:01,979
will affect your shopping you'll start

602
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:04,138
thinking about the earth differently as

603
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:06,119
a whole so that's one of the benefits

604
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:08,939
and also some of these side effects of

605
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:10,648
growing in a living soil environment if

606
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,509
you start working into like a no-till

607
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:13,048
environment another huge advantage is

608
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:15,058
very

609
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:17,489
minimal waste when it comes to no-till

610
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:19,618
there is essentially no waste in a

611
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:22,769
no-till environment you harvest a plant

612
00:22:19,618 --> 00:22:25,618
you hang the plant that gets trimmed and

613
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:28,259
dried and cured and consumed the waste

614
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:29,999
goes back into your compost pile that

615
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,860
pot where we just cut that plan out of

616
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:33,778
we're gonna gently cut the root ball out

617
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,548
of there just just that big root ball

618
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:37,528
just take that out then we're gonna put

619
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:39,749
another clone in that spot and we're

620
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:41,609
gonna backfill that with composted dirt

621
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:44,368
that we've got in our compost pile and

622
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:47,699
now we've got a fresh plant ready to go

623
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:50,158
with zero waste so that is a huge

624
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,139
advantage to a no-till garden people

625
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,239
growing cocoa or growing soil they've

626
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:57,118
got to figure out how to either recycle

627
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:59,519
or get rid of all of that cocoa or soil

628
00:22:57,118 --> 00:23:02,788
and if you've got more than four or five

629
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,589
three gallon pots worth of used cocoa or

630
00:23:02,788 --> 00:23:05,999
soil it becomes a challenge to try to

631
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:07,829
get rid of that you can't just dump it

632
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:09,659
in the backyard someone's gonna notice

633
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:10,949
that big fresh pile of dirt with a bunch

634
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,720
of perlite in there and they're gonna

635
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,548
say perlite what's he doing and it's

636
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,379
gonna just start triggering things so

637
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:19,019
that's hugely advantageous to not have

638
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:20,969
any waste when it comes to no-till

639
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,329
gardening another huge advantage is

640
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:26,069
there are minimal bug threats it seems

641
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:28,678
like when you establish a no-till garden

642
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:30,839
it comes right along with beneficial

643
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,359
insects and if you do introduce any

644
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:35,368
spider mites or unwanted pests those

645
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:37,138
beneficial insects are already there and

646
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:38,908
they'll creep in and destroy the

647
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:41,608
population before it gets out of control

648
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:43,830
so that's always a good thing with the

649
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:45,658
no-till garden our friend frosty was on

650
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:47,339
the show a while back and he was talking

651
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,440
about going hiking and then walking

652
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:51,269
right into his no-till grow and I said

653
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,220
bro don't you kind of worry about maybe

654
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:54,720
gathering a spider mite on your shoe and

655
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,460
taking spider mites into that girl and

656
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,350
he said bro that's just food for the

657
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,419
predator mites that are already in there

658
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:02,189
so the no-till guys seem to be fairly

659
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,070
confident in their pest management

660
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,288
system so some of the major advantages

661
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:10,349
to a living soil or an organic system

662
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:11,878
are it is clean and organic as long as

663
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,769
everything you put in there is organic

664
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:16,498
you know that everything comes out of

665
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:19,319
there is organic that means a lot to a

666
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:22,019
lot of people also it is sustainable

667
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,210
if the grow shop burns down if Amazon

668
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:26,609
shuts down if you learn how to grow like

669
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,750
a farmer when the [ __ ] hits the fan

670
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:29,459
you'll be one of the few people out

671
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,009
there growing your own food and growing

672
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,900
herb for us to smoke and that goes right

673
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:36,029
along with what I call a side effect you

674
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,980
start becoming more aware of what you're

675
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:39,808
doing to the environment when you go

676
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,759
grocery shopping you'll find yourself in

677
00:24:39,808 --> 00:24:43,589
the produce section trying to buy more

678
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,379
things that have something you can add

679
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:48,689
to your compost bin after you eat so it

680
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,460
will totally affect the way you shop the

681
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,380
way you eat and the way you live and

682
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,870
when you head into the no-till range

683
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:59,010
another huge advantage is minimal waste

684
00:24:54,869 --> 00:25:00,750
and very minimal pests now once we've

685
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:02,519
got our living soil established and

686
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,740
we've got our garden going if we do

687
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,960
notice some sort of a deficiency there

688
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,419
are ways that we can add nutrients to

689
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,730
our organic system without introducing

690
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:14,580
bottled nutrients it is very easy to

691
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,589
brew up a compost tea Shawn and Jessi

692
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,750
have talked about compost teas a lot on

693
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:20,579
this show I'm not gonna go too deep into

694
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,410
making a tea you basically throw

695
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:24,418
amendments in a bucket and add an

696
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,790
aerator and you let it bubble for a

697
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,440
certain amount of time then depending on

698
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,569
the strength of the tea and the type of

699
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,820
tea we made we either dilute it or we

700
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:35,399
water it directly into the plants as

701
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:38,789
long as everything you used to make your

702
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,340
tea was organic your grow is still fully

703
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:43,710
organic another option for adding

704
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:46,709
nutrients to a slowing organic garden is

705
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,840
to top dress you can place organic

706
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,819
amendments on top of the soil and water

707
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,548
them in just like you would a bottled

708
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:55,230
nutrient this may not work as rapidly as

709
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:56,819
it would when using bottled nutrients

710
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,849
because you will need time for the

711
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:01,950
organic amendments to break down but top

712
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:04,829
dressing is certainly a way to add

713
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:07,710
nutrients to an organic living soil

714
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:09,449
without introducing bottled nutrients so

715
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,400
if you've set up a living soil or a

716
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,470
super soil and you see those plants are

717
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,120
slowing down or if you see those plants

718
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,548
are showing you some type of deficiency

719
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,500
you should be able to brew up a compost

720
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:21,750
tea or top dress with the appropriate

721
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,000
amendment to add the missing element

722
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,769
that those plants will need things I

723
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,650
have heard Jessi and Sean talk about top

724
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:32,400
dressing quite often our fish meal kelp

725
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:34,320
meal alfalfa and comfrey so now before I

726
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,570
get myself too far off track let's talk

727
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,909
about some of the cons of working with a

728
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:40,079
living soil or a super soil type

729
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,509
environment

730
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,099
downside is the mix work if you don't

731
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:46,169
have a space to mix this if you don't

732
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:47,908
have a space to cook the soil it might

733
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:50,490
not be an option it does take a lot of

734
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:53,130
space to create this soil then it does

735
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,048
take a trash can worth of space to store

736
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,179
this soil now that leads me right into

737
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:59,398
the next part which is the cook time

738
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:01,169
maybe you decided you want to start a

739
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:03,898
garden and you're going to start it next

740
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:05,850
week you need at least 30 days to brew

741
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:08,369
up a batch of super soil you were

742
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:10,528
already running late so the downside is

743
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:12,869
the cook time you've got to mix it

744
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:15,750
you've got to let it cook and come alive

745
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:17,778
now another disadvantage to working with

746
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,429
a super soil or a living soil is

747
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:22,859
understanding the richness of the soil

748
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,659
you just made is that soil too hot for

749
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:26,969
little plants will it be okay for little

750
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,889
plants a new grower may not have the eye

751
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,240
to see if those plants are having

752
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:31,918
problems and they won't know how to

753
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,200
identify it and they won't know how to

754
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,480
prevent or correct an issue if they see

755
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,808
it in a living soil so that could be

756
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,788
problematic another disadvantage to

757
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:43,980
working with the living soil is if you

758
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:46,740
do have a pest issue you are very

759
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,659
limited on approaches for eradicating

760
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,778
your pests you've got to stick to

761
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:54,299
organic options if you've got a soil

762
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:56,519
pest problem your options are very

763
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,379
limited like we said earlier you

764
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,149
shouldn't encounter too many problems in

765
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,130
an organic soil environment because

766
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:04,739
we've got enough microorganisms there to

767
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,510
keep that in check but if you do end up

768
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,028
with a root problem you were very

769
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:10,980
limited on ways you can treat you cannot

770
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:13,470
treat your living soil with a root

771
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,058
drench if you were running a soil garden

772
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,370
and you were feeding with bottled

773
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:19,589
nutrients and you ran into a root

774
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:21,658
problem like a root pest you would be

775
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:24,599
able to do a root drench with a

776
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:27,539
pesticide either botanic garden or

777
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,609
evergreen you just mix up 15 to 30 mils

778
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:31,319
per gallon any water that right in with

779
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:34,740
your feeding solution and that will

780
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:36,450
eradicate any soil-borne pests if we go

781
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,480
feeding Botanic Garden Makka revver

782
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,940
green to a living soil situation we

783
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,399
basically destroy the entire environment

784
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,840
we worked to create in there so that is

785
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,879
something to keep in mind when you were

786
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,829
thinking about your nutrient and feeding

787
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,720
regimen are you going to be able to

788
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:52,809
implement your integrated pest

789
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,230
management

790
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:59,200
with your nutrient and soil selections

791
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,809
it's all got to work together so those

792
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,240
are basically the pros and cons of

793
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:06,339
working with a living organic soil

794
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,740
basically you've got an organic

795
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:11,409
sustainable garden that should feel good

796
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,059
to grow the only real disadvantage that

797
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,130
I can think of when it comes to growing

798
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:17,049
in a living soil or an organic type

799
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,180
environment is it it takes a lot of work

800
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:21,399
ahead there's a lot of work that has to

801
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,920
happen before you start growing but that

802
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,740
work ahead may be exactly what some

803
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,060
people want that may be your style maybe

804
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,799
you're one of the people that enjoy the

805
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,210
smell of that rich dirt maybe you're the

806
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:33,220
guy that enjoys mixing all those

807
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,690
amendments together maybe you like

808
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,700
having worm castings under your

809
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,470
fingernails maybe you're into brewing

810
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,330
your own compost teas are waiting for

811
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,490
your own fermented plant juices to

812
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:45,579
ferment it's all about what makes you

813
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,410
happy with your gross style also it's

814
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:49,960
all about your abilities and what is

815
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,370
available to you if you live in a big

816
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,259
city maybe some of those organic

817
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:55,809
amendments won't be as available to you

818
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:57,759
if you live in a small city a small farm

819
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:59,769
area you'll have access to all of those

820
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,619
organic inputs but you may not have

821
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:04,389
access to bottles and a hydro store so

822
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:06,729
it may come down to what's available in

823
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:08,740
your area yes most of us do have access

824
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,960
to Amazon but not everybody can afford

825
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,990
everything on Amazon so you may have to

826
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,850
adjust to your budget as well the main

827
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,920
point of your garden is to produce a

828
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:19,569
product that makes you happy so as long

829
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,220
as you are happy with your garden as

830
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:22,659
long as you're having fun as long as

831
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,069
you're enjoying yourself and as long as

832
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,470
you were getting a product at the end

833
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:29,049
that makes you happy you are doing it

834
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,730
right so set up a grow that you love are

835
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:32,409
you the scientist do you want to be in

836
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,380
there with a couple of measuring devices

837
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:37,210
and bottles and measuring out 15 mils of

838
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,730
this and pour it in now let's measure

839
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,009
out 35 mils of this and pour it in and

840
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,430
mix it now let's test the PPM's see what

841
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,839
that is

842
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,029
whoo that looks real good now let's

843
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,009
adjust the pH now let's water the plants

844
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:49,690
are you that guy or either guy that

845
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:51,549
wants to mix up everything at the

846
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,049
beginning and then just add water and

847
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,609
then just watch the plants grow

848
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:56,289
maybe you're the guy that wants to brew

849
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:58,659
up a bunch of teas maybe you're that guy

850
00:30:56,289 --> 00:31:00,549
making the fermented plant juices it's

851
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,290
all up to you you can be the scientist

852
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:03,970
you can be the farmer you can be

853
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:05,710
somewhere in between as long as you are

854
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,529
happy with your garden that's really

855
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,019
what matters

856
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:10,490
now there are many more ways to feed

857
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:12,889
your plants I'm sure there are many more

858
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:15,589
nutrient styles and fertilizing systems

859
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:18,020
one thing I should mention is aquaponics

860
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:19,939
I am not experienced in aquaponics I

861
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:21,619
can't teach you about aquaponics but I

862
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,180
feel like we would be leaving out all of

863
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:25,599
our friends at the growing with fishes

864
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,580
podcast if I didn't at least mention

865
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,500
aquaponics as a very viable and

866
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:32,119
sustainable way of fertilizing your

867
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,369
cannabis garden so big shout out to my

868
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:36,319
friends at growing with fishes I find it

869
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:38,149
fascinating but I do not have any

870
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,149
experience so I can't teach you anything

871
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:44,180
about it so that is my podcast about

872
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,790
selecting nutrients and fertilizers for

873
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,590
your new cannabis grow remember the most

874
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:50,389
important part is that you are having

875
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:52,549
fun and that you are happy with what

876
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,530
comes out of your garden also try to

877
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:56,359
keep in mind the ethics of whoever you

878
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:58,549
are giving your money to try to shop

879
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:01,219
