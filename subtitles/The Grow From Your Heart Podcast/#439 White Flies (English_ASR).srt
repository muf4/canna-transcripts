40
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,600
flies before we get there I would like

41
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,959
to talk about something I saw in the

42
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,199
news recently recently I saw a report of

43
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,179
a young lady dying from cannabis use I

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,939
want to come on this podcast and call

45
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,040
complete [ __ ] that young lady did

46
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,529
not die because of cannabis use

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,329
I do not know that lady's medical

48
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,399
history I don't know anything about that

49
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,039
person the only thing I know is that

50
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,218
this person died and the coroner found

51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,860
THC and her system so he then decided

52
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:04,649
that cannabis is what killed this lady I

53
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,539
call complete [ __ ] I think that this

54
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,920
medical examiner is blaming cannabis

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,289
because he can't find the true cause of

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,239
death I also think he may be blaming

57
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,649
cannabis so that he can catch a little

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,569
spotlight time for a minute

59
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,670
if he finds the very first

60
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,439
cannabis-related death that will put him

61
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,238
in some sort of medical book that will

62
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,709
put some news on him I'm talking about

63
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,450
the doctor right now even though I won't

64
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,069
say his name he is getting a little bit

65
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:28,048
of spotlight time because of this

66
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,119
situation he may be taking that

67
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:32,819
opportunity to get a little attention

68
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,920
and he may be on the other team he may

69
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:37,139
be against cannabis so this would be a

70
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,048
good way to kind of throw cannabis under

71
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,359
the bus is to find the very first death

72
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,159
caused by cannabis so he would be able

73
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,209
to fight for the other team you'd be

74
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:47,639
able to get a little bit of notoriety

75
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,650
and he would also have a cause an

76
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,289
explanation for this young lady's death

77
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,109
from everything else I read there is not

78
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:57,780
a reasonable cause of death so he simply

79
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,420
states that he believes cannabis is what

80
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,939
did it I am NOT a doctor I'm not going

81
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,738
to try to explain why you cannot OD from

82
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:06,870
cannabis it does not work on the parts

83
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,000
of your body that make you shut down and

84
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,370
make you die those are different drugs

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,158
if you could die from cannabis it would

86
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,900
have happened a long time ago myself and

87
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,439
many of my friends would have been

88
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,719
victims several years ago I do not know

89
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,340
anything about this young lady's medical

90
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,780
history I don't know anything about her

91
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,209
health history I don't know anything

92
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,639
about her life or her habits she was not

93
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,049
an old person she was not a sick person

94
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,849
that is really all that any of the

95
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,459
articles listed would mention about her

96
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:37,619
the only real details we got was that

97
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,419
she was dead and that she had THC in her

98
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,329
system and that the coroner was blaming

99
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,669
it on the THC I know it's tragic and

100
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:47,340
terrible and anybody dies but sometimes

101
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:48,959
people just die without explanation

102
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,909
there doesn't have to be a reason

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,219
sometimes part of your body just goes in

104
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,689
done sometimes your car breaks down

105
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:56,549
sometimes your computer gives up

106
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:57,840
sometimes a light bulb burns out our

107
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,969
bodies are made of a bunch of different

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,620
connecting parts and one one decides to

109
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:04,739
shut down it can shut down the whole

110
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,449
system so I don't know what killed this

111
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,980
young lady

112
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:10,319
honestly I don't believe the coroner

113
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,959
knows what killed this young lady one

114
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,259
thing I am certain of this lady did not

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,660
die because she had THC in her system so

116
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,339
no matter what the news tells you no

117
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,820
matter what this report tells you there

118
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,279
are still zero deaths linked to cannabis

119
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,540
consumption I want to send my love and

120
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,949
my condolences to this

121
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,720
young ladies family it's terrible that

122
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,129
she's been brought into the news and

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,170
into the spotlight in such a terrible

124
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:35,370
way but I send my love I send my heart

125
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,470
out to her her family

126
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,170
I send a big middle finger to this

127
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,370
coroner ah he is wrong he's a liar I

128
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,590
really think he's just trying to get

129
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,840
some spotlight I am not sure if this is

130
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,549
the end of this story I'm not sure if he

131
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,139
can just say cannabis caused this and

132
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,759
then somewhere in some record book it

133
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,949
now says that there is an official

134
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,079
cannabis death I hope that there is more

135
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,789
investigation more to be proven before

136
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,060
that can be marked down I will do my

137
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,500
best to stay updated on that situation

138
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,079

been bested by white flies let me give

147
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,959
you a little background on my grow I

148
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,990
grow in a reasonably sized cabinet six

149
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,810
foot by two foot divided into two by two

150
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,660
and four by two spaces and a two by two

151
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,089
grow tent I keep my mothers in the two

152
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,670
by two cabinet I grow out clones in the

153
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:41,909
two by two flower in the four by two all

154
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,520
in soil with LED lighting all of this is

155
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,830
in my basement all right so we got a

156
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,750
nice little compact Perpetual grow it

157
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:51,629
says about two or two-and-a-half months

158
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,420
ago I found white flies in my flower

159
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:56,430
I picked off every affected leaf and put

160
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,620
out a bunch of sticky traps here on the

161
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,480
right start I shook the plants three to

162
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,050
four times a day and vacuumed up what

163
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,689
flew off which got me through flower so

164
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,460
far that is an effective strategy let's

165
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:11,399
talk about white flies really quickly

166
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,799
white flies are really easy to identify

167
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,599
they are little white flies they look

168
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,430
like flying pieces of ash in your grow

169
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,930
room if you pull off the leaf and turn

170
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,660
it upside down it looks like a piece of

171
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,030
rice or probably bunches of pieces of

172
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,890
rice on the bottom of your leaves those

173
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,959
are white flies when you shake the

174
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,879
plants when you tap the pots if white

175
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,370
things come flying out those are white

176
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,409
flies this guy said he shook the plants

177
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,060
three to four times a day and vacuumed

178
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,310
up what flew off that is a very

179
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,259
effective strategy those white flies

180
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,370
want to fly up toward the light when you

181
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,569
shake the plant you just

182
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,860
RUP them they're nice and comfortable

183
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,209
they're hanging out in the leaves you

184
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,340
shake it they go what the [ __ ] was that

185
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,629
they go flying up toward the light they

186
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,339
just want to go fly and tell that all

187
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,139
the disruption stops and they'll go land

188
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:54,869
back on their home while they're flying

189
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,850
get the shot back and just shot back the

190
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,949
[ __ ] out of them I use the long

191
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,449
attachment on the shopvac and I would

192
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,040
just point that right at the light and

193
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,930
just kind of move back and forth as

194
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,520
those bugs fly up at the light and just

195
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,410
get them if you want to get in there and

196
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,299
kind of tap the buds with the shopvac

197
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,979
and just smack it you're using that long

198
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,930
wand attachment just smack some of the

199
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:14,370
buds with that and then the bugs will go

200
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,079
flying out and you just suck them up

201
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,030
right as they come flying out there you

202
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,668
can do that multiple times a day if you

203
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:22,859
remove a lot of the excess foliage the

204
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:24,899
white flies have less places to hang out

205
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,850
less places for breeding make it less

206
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:30,299
desirable in there there is more to this

207
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,160
email let's keep going it says now with

208
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,110
everything in veg I went to the gross

209
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,419
store and got the recommendations of my

210
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,449
local guy and treated with a rosemary

211
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:41,579
extract pesticide I also did a soil

212
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,370
soaked and foliar spray on all three

213
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:47,728
spaces and I sprayed down all surfaces

214
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,560
as well all right so you got a pesticide

215
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:52,199
that was recommended by a grouse store

216
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,209
person then you did a soil soak and a

217
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,709
foliar spray on all of your spaces so

218
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,409
you treated all the plants that were in

219
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,839
veg then you also sprayed down all

220
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,789
surfaces that is a good plan of attack

221
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,179
that is a good strategy but I honestly

222
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:07,709
don't think that the rosemary extract

223
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,709
pesticide is going to be strong enough

224
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:12,529
to eradicate white flies at the level

225
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,329
which you have got that you have got a

226
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,848
serious infestation and something like a

227
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,439
rosemary extract works better as a

228
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:21,598
preventative it just makes it kind of

229
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,009
undesirable for the for the pests and

230
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,300
they're already there they don't give a

231
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,069
[ __ ] they have made themselves

232
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,720
comfortable I don't think you're gonna

233
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:30,000
get enough coverage with this rosemary

234
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,740
extract to run them off there's more to

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,139
the message let's keep going it says it

236
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,120
seemed to work he recommended holding

237
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,250
off on moving anything into flower and

238
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,709
treat a few times a week for a few weeks

239
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,559
to make sure the white flies are gone

240
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:46,619
everything seemed to be going well I

241
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,659
treated for three weeks I cut new clones

242
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,299
I moved my current clones to flower and

243
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,939
after a week under twelve twelve I found

244
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,990
more white flies something to address

245
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,209
right there

246
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,919
first off you started with a pesticide

247
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,559
application that was not strong enough

248
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,208
for the infestation you were battling so

249
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,859
you did not really have a chance it

250
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,329
looks like you knocked him down but

251
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,879
there were still eggs you need to break

252
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,610
the life cycle of the pest you need to

253
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,110
disrupt multiple generations then you

254
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,639
can guarantee that the paths are gone

255
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,100
but you were using something that didn't

256
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,620
knock out all stages then you made a

257
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,589
crucial mistake you applied the same

258
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,980
pesticide multiple times a week for

259
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:27,570
multiple weeks by the third week those

260
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,039
white flies were laughing at that

261
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,950
pesticide they were gone

262
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,599
haha we drink that [ __ ] now and the bugs

263
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,080
that are now in your room have built up

264
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,120
a resistance to that rosemary extract

265
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,610
pesticide so your main crucial mistake

266
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,528
was using one pesticide over and over

267
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,570
again you need to rotate products you

268
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:48,088
need multiple different products so that

269
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,250
you can prevent that resistance and you

270
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,050
also need the appropriate pesticide you

271
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,490
were basically just given them a bubble

272
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,169
bath after a while and they were just

273
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,120
laughing at you let's keep going there

274
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:58,559
is more to this message at this point

275
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,320
the plants are in flower they're under

276
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,869
12 12 and we have discovered more white

277
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,120
flies one week into flower so it says

278
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,828
they are in all three spaces yes those

279
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,528
white flies get around quite quickly

280
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:11,789
they breed rapidly white flies are a

281
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,679
pain in the ass they get out of control

282
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:16,169
really quickly but we are going to help

283
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,099
you get rid of them he says I trashed

284
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:21,778
all of my clones and flowering plants I

285
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,120
trimmed up my mother plants i vacuumed

286
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:26,689
the spaces out and I tried insecticidal

287
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,159
soap on the mothers and empty Gro spaces

288
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,470
again it seemed to help I thought they

289
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,379
were gone I cut new clones and this week

290
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,240
they're back again yeah that

291
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:38,129
insecticidal soap and that rosemary oil

292
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,629
are not gonna cut it we're gonna have to

293
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:41,129
step up our game we're gonna have to go

294
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,629
nuclear pretty soon we're gonna have to

295
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,639
talk about that let's keep going there

296
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:46,320
is more to this message I grabbed a bag

297
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,028
of diatomaceous earth and I've dusted

298
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,040
everything I checked today and the

299
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:53,578
bottoms of my leaves are loaded with

300
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,828
white fly larvae once again I need a

301
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:57,899
nuclear solution to this I'm not sure

302
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:59,819
what else to try other than bug bombs in

303
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,850
each grow space and I hope the mothers

304
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,379
survive to cut clones from can you

305
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,800
recommend anything that would be a

306
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,700
surefire way to wipe out my white flies

307
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,069
and

308
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,100
advice would be greatly appreciated

309
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,930
thanks again from Dan hey Dan thank you

310
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,639
for the great email it's too bad you got

311
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:20,009
white flies but let's talk about getting

312
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,809
rid of those bad [ __ ] for you

313
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:24,149
white flies can be a pain in the ass

314
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:26,489
like I said earlier they come on quickly

315
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,500
they breed quickly they spread from room

316
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,240
to room rapidly unless you know how to

317
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,860
get rid of them they can be a complete

318
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,730
pain in the ass let's talk about

319
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,379
eradicating white flies in your grow one

320
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,300
thing that I like is you only have

321
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:40,769
mother plants that is going to be very

322
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,750
beneficial we don't have to think about

323
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,189
treating plants that are in flower we

324
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,080
will talk about treating flowering

325
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,150
plants but it's going to help you out a

326
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,770
lot that you can apply just about

327
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,509
anything at this point because you have

328
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,919
got veg plants you don't have any buds

329
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:55,889
to worry about that is truly

330
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,479
advantageous I think a lot of growers a

331
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:59,009
lot of facilities are doing it a little

332
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,379
bit backwards when it comes to pest

333
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,750
management they focus on treating the

334
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,789
flowering plants for a pass they're the

335
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,409
priority for pest management then they

336
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:09,419
go to the large veg then they go to the

337
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:11,100
small veg then they go to the tiny stuff

338
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:12,750
then they go to the moms and they worry

339
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,670
about the moms dead last when it comes

340
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,889
to pest management I like to go to the

341
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:19,919
complete opposite direction I like to

342
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:21,659
worry about pest pathogen problem-free

343
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,699
mother plants and work my way forward

344
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:26,730
through the grow with a good healthy

345
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,680
start so in my opinion IPM starts in the

346
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,300
mother room then it works all the way

347
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,009
through the grow it's a process it

348
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,259
starts in the mother room just like all

349
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:36,269
the other plants so I love that you've

350
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:38,939
got nothing but mother plants to work

351
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:40,379
with that puts you ahead of the game one

352
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,690
of the first things I would do is work

353
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,850
on sealing up my grow space where are

354
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,140
those bugs coming in they're tiny but

355
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,730
they're finding a way in and they are

356
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,649
breeding so figure out where they're

357
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,720
coming from seal up the grow space a

358
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:54,870
little bit more securely that will help

359
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,509
you out the next step is to D foliate

360
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,669
heavily take off any leaf you don't

361
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,439
think you need we need to get rid of all

362
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:03,809
of the breeding space all the hangout

363
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,640
spots we need to remove all the space

364
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:07,859
for these [ __ ] white flies to hang

365
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,960
out let's take away all the free parking

366
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,389
just chop it out of there clean it up

367
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,220
get that out of the grow space get that

368
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,720
out of the house you said this is in

369
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,330
your basement get it out of the house

370
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,009
get it as far away from your house as

371
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,730
you can get rid of all these white flies

372
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:25,490
just evict them get out we don't want

373
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,570
here so defoliate heavily be fully to

374
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,610
the point that you're worried about

375
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,959
those plants they'll grow more leaves

376
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,610
they'll come back as long as those

377
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,708
plants are mostly healthy they will

378
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,659
recover from the defoliation they will

379
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:38,299
like being d foliated more than they

380
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:40,669
like being a host for white flies so

381
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:42,588
strip off any extra leaves strip off all

382
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:43,549
the giant fan leaves we don't need all

383
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,230
that [ __ ] right now

384
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:46,849
these aren't high-performance plants

385
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,740
these are mother plants that we're just

386
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,470
trying to make survive at this point in

387
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,360
time so defoliate heavily your next

388
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,639
thing to think about is stepping up your

389
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,860
spray regimen the things you're spraying

390
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,198
right now have basically become kool-aid

391
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,959
for the white flies I would suggest a

392
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:04,759
stronger pesticide application here is

393
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,979
where you have a few moral decisions to

394
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,500
make how strong of a pesticide do you

395
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,990
want to use I try to stay on the

396
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,690
Colorado Department of Agriculture

397
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,698
approved pesticide list for commercial

398
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,130
cannabis production I try to maintain

399
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:21,229
that standard in any grow I work in

400
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,939
whether it be a home grow whether it be

401
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,800
a commercial grow I still try to adhere

402
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,990
to those standards just to make it a

403
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,698
habit some people don't want to use any

404
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,940
pesticides that are not Omri certified

405
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:34,009
organic what you spray on your plants is

406
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,510
ultimately your decision but also you

407
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,129
have to live with what you've done to

408
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:39,198
those plants and what you are giving to

409
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:41,028
other people to consume so as long as

410
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,099
you can live with yourself and you feel

411
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:44,448
okay with what you've done you can apply

412
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,730
whatever you're comfortable with to

413
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:49,549
these plants in this message you said

414
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,850
you're ready to go nuclear carefully

415
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:55,698
scheduled sprayed pesticide applications

416
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,550
will be the quickest and simplest way to

417
00:14:55,698 --> 00:15:00,139
eradicate these bugs but we can't just

418
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,179
keep spraying forever so we need to

419
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,620
eradicate them and figure out how they

420
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:06,198
got in there and make sure they don't

421
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,179
come back so let's talk about a few

422
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,099
products we can apply to our plants to

423
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:12,708
make sure we get rid of these white

424
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,860
flies one thing we can start with is as

425
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:18,018
a max as a max has multiple modes of

426
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,389
attack to make sure these bugs don't

427
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,889
want to be around hopefully when you're

428
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:23,448
working with as a max you're wearing a

429
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,000
glove but if you've ever touched it

430
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:27,799
you'll notice that it is quite oily we

431
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,958
apply that oily consistency to the

432
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,698
bottom of the leaves the bugs don't want

433
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,409
to be on that oily consistency so it

434
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,309
makes it undesirable for them to live

435
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:38,588
there then as an added bonus there is a

436
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:40,628
in the a Xamax that works as a stomach

437
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,579
poison so any pest that does eat your

438
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,470
leafy foliage they will get a tummy ache

439
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:46,719
it will stop eating and they will die

440
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,209
another product I can recommend for you

441
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,339
is evergreen pyrethrum there's also a

442
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:53,229
very similar product called pi Ganic

443
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:55,660
there are very similar products but they

444
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,889
do have different application rates so

445
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:58,600
if you are used to using one or the

446
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,999
other make sure you read the bottle and

447
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,069
adjust your application rates both of

448
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:04,689
those products are very oily and very

449
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:06,578
sticky so again we're going to apply

450
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:08,318
those to the bottom the underside of the

451
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:10,628
leaves where do we see all those eggs if

452
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:12,429
we apply a nice coat of oily surface

453
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:13,539
those bugs don't want to go there they

454
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,278
don't want to hang out they don't want

455
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,198
to breed and will also suffocate the

456
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:17,708
bugs and we can also suffocate their

457
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,289
eggs

458
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:22,599
so if we use evergreen or pie ganic our

459
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:24,490
first mode of attack is to create an

460
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,980
undesirable environment by making it

461
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,198
sticky we're also suffocating them then

462
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,909
there's also the added bonus of the

463
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,620
pyrethrum in there so anything that does

464
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,429
take a bite out of the leaf it is going

465
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,709
to get a tummy ache

466
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:38,198
and it is going to die those are both

467
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:40,568
very affordable products another very

468
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,878
affordable and readily available product

469
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:46,088
is something called monterey garden

470
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,550
spray with spinosad i'm not sure if you

471
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:50,410
call it spinosad or spinosad either way

472
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:53,318
that [ __ ] works to get rid of white

473
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:55,389
flies spinosad is a fungus that is

474
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:57,370
created in the bottom of whiskey or rum

475
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,259
barrels I believe it is the bottom of a

476
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,750
whiskey barrel it is naturally occurring

477
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:04,179
and for some reason it kills the [ __ ]

478
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,980
out of white flies so there's a product

479
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:08,439
called monterey garden spray and it will

480
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,689
say spinosad right on the bottle it is

481
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,939
very affordable it is very easy to find

482
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:14,110
another product I can recommend for you

483
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,880
we're starting to get a little more

484
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,859
expensive also we're starting to get a

485
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,990
little more dangerous a little less

486
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:22,509
gentle another product I'll recommend is

487
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,970
something called venerate venerate we'll

488
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:27,398
wipe the [ __ ] out of almost every pest

489
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,440
in your garden another product I can

490
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:29,859
recommend for white flies is botanic

491
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,710
guard

492
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:35,949
EAS and I also like a product called bio

493
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:38,169
seer WP both of those products contain a

494
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,000
beneficial fungus I'm trying to remember

495
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,509
the name it is actually called Bavaria

496
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,669
basi onna which is very good at

497
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:47,408
destroying white flies now if you really

498
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:49,270
want to step up your game a really

499
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:50,169
expensive product that will work to help

500
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:53,288
you get rid of your why

501
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:56,889
flies is a product called my Cotrell es

502
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:58,690
o be forewarned that one is not cheap I

503
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:59,378
don't know your budget I don't know what

504
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,359
you're working with

505
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,699
I don't know how nuclear you want to go

506
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:05,739
but that is a nice list of products

507
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,919
they'll will work to eradicate your

508
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:11,350
white flies know whatever you choose to

509
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,200
use to get rid of these bugs make sure

510
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:16,839
you have a rotation don't spray the same

511
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,179
product every three days Spray one

512
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:21,519
product on day one apply a different

513
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:23,889
product on day four apply a different

514
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,230
product on day seven if you can then

515
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:28,118
start the rotation over but don't do the

516
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,128
same product more than two times in a

517
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:31,449
row no matter what you do that is how

518
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:33,128
you start giving these pests a

519
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,989
resistance to the products you're buying

520
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:36,998
your bugs are gonna get stronger and

521
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,669
stronger you're gonna create super bugs

522
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:42,999
in there another thing you can do is you

523
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:46,330
can tank mix multiple pesticides in an

524
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:49,089
applicator at one time as long as those

525
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:51,189
products are compatible so before you go

526
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:52,509
mixing a large batch of pesticide if

527
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,129
you're going to do a tank mix of

528
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:56,649
multiple pesticides you've never ran

529
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:59,138
together before I suggest mixing a very

530
00:18:56,648 --> 00:19:00,849
small batch of them together mix it up

531
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,979
see what happens see if you get any

532
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:05,288
weird chemical reactions out of it if

533
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,608
you don't get any weird reactions mix up

534
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:08,440
the desired amount which you want to

535
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:10,538
apply to your plants then pick one

536
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,548
sacrificial plant and spray the [ __ ] out

537
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:14,888
of it see if that one plant does any

538
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:16,960
weird [ __ ] if it doesn't harm that plant

539
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:19,599
you've got a great mix that is your new

540
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,980
pesticide application write down exactly

541
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,959
what went in there write down how much

542
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,519
water you started with write down how

543
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,108
much whatever product you put in there

544
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:28,329
write down how much of the other product

545
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:30,579
you put in there write it down write

546
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:33,249
down when you sprayed write down what

547
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:35,470
you saw from that take a lot of notes we

548
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:37,720
consume cannabis so we forget a lot of

549
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,608
[ __ ] make sure you write things down if

550
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,350
you want a great lesson on mixing

551
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:43,358
multiple pesticides in one spray

552
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:45,308
applicator for one good application I

553
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:48,069
highly recommend an episode I did call

554
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:49,628
tank mix it is episode number 289 of the

555
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:51,368
growth from your heart podcast make sure

556
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:53,798
you check that one out I talked a lot

557
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:56,288
about mixing pesticides and proper

558
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:58,720
pesticide application so we've got a lot

559
00:19:56,288 --> 00:20:00,759
of spray pesticide application options

560
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,950
another thing I would recommend is a

561
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,730
root drench many of the products I

562
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,000
recommended

563
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:09,038
are also usable as a drench I feel that

564
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,409
maybe some of the larvae from your white

565
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,669
flies has ended up in your medium that's

566
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,450
why you're having a hard time getting

567
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,460
rid of them

568
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,319
you've got eggs just chilling down there

569
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,639
in the soil so I would recommend a root

570
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,189
drench I would probably use the

571
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:23,079
Evergreen or the a Xamax or the Bataan

572
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,909
Agard and I would just mix that into

573
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,369
some water and I would soak the roots

574
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:28,840
thoroughly just water it in let it soak

575
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:31,449
out through the bottom that way you've

576
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:33,369
got pesticide in your medium we need to

577
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,620
go nuclear like you said we don't need

578
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:38,319
to leave any open space let's get the

579
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,158
leaves coated and nasty stickiness let's

580
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,138
get the root zone

581
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,240
let's get that medium coated and nasty

582
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:45,819
stickiness let's not make it a desirable

583
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,829
environment for these white flies now

584
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:50,019
when you do a root drench you do need to

585
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,908
make sure not to suffocate the roots so

586
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,929
whatever your recommended dosage is for

587
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:55,510
your foliar spray

588
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:58,090
I would probably reduce the root drench

589
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:59,679
application to about half of whatever

590
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:02,079
you were spraying so if you're spraying

591
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,360
10 milliliters of a product I would root

592
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,730
drench with five you can always route

593
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:09,038
drench again with the increased dosage

594
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,778
but you can't under inch so once those

595
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,788
roots are coated in oil and you've got a

596
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:14,679
problem you're already pretty [ __ ]

597
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:16,028
so go light then if that doesn't do it

598
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,830
go harder next time

599
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:21,099
pay close attention to the plants like I

600
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:22,509
said write everything down another thing

601
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:24,490
we need to do is continue with the

602
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:26,288
yellow sticky traps those yellow sticky

603
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,659
traps are going to let us know how the

604
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:30,429
population is sustaining we'll know if

605
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,200
there are less if there are more white

606
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,820
flies than there were before one

607
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,470
important thing is to change those

608
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:37,538
sticky traps if you leave the same trap

609
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,548
up for too long how do you know how many

610
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:41,648
flies were gathered at one point in time

611
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,778
so make sure you rotate them on a

612
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:46,569
frequent basis once a week is probably

613
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:48,730
enough so we have heavily d foliated

614
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:50,349
we've taken all that foliage out of the

615
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,940
grow it's out of the house it's as far

616
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:54,298
away as we can get it we have burned it

617
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,710
it is gone then we have applied

618
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:58,629
ridiculous amounts of pesticides on a

619
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,759
routine schedule we're spraying every

620
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,710
three days and we are rotating we're

621
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,720
possibly doing a tank mix with multiple

622
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,028
pesticides this is going to knock down

623
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,440
the populations then we are going to do

624
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:10,058
a route drench this is going to make

625
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,009
sure that none of the larvae none of the

626
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:14,798
eggs are chilling in the medium now

627
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:16,538
we've in theory destroyed all of the

628
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:17,650
bugs we were trying to get rid of what

629
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:19,809
are we going to do to

630
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,610
make sure they don't come back it sounds

631
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:23,889
like the first step is to seal the room

632
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:26,500
the next step is to think of an

633
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,030
integrated pest management strategy that

634
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,579
will make sure we don't get these bugs

635
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:32,200
back when we are late in Flour it is

636
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:33,849
really easy to get rid of these bugs

637
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,590
with our mother plants with our veg

638
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:36,879
plants because we can just go spraying

639
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:39,099
every three days

640
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,200
once we've got buds we can't spray

641
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:43,539
anymore so what are we going to do to

642
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,640
make sure we don't get bugs later in

643
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:48,579
Flour this is where I like to introduce

644
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,340
predator insects spider mites thrips

645
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:53,349
fungus gnats white flies I don't care

646
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:55,899
what kind of bug you are you cannot

647
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:58,240
build a resistance to being eaten by a

648
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,990
predator so once you have eradicated

649
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,819
your infestation and you're sure that

650
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:06,039
99.9% of these white flies are gone I

651
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:08,980
would switch my strategy and invest

652
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,539
heavily in predator bugs if you are at a

653
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,880
point where you have only got mother

654
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:15,069
plants and/or veg plants you were at a

655
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,750
huge advantage to start with predator

656
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:19,000
bugs it is a great time to start

657
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,400
building colonies you can purchase

658
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,619
enough predator bugs to build a large

659
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,320
enough colony to overtake any sort of

660
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:28,569
invaders that may try to come in if you

661
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,299
start with your moms and your veg plants

662
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:33,909
the idea would be to get enough predator

663
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:35,859
insects on those veg plants or when you

664
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,779
take clones you move some predators

665
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:39,849
right along with the clones then those

666
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:42,309
veg plants start to grow and those

667
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:43,750
predator insects will colonize on your

668
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,399
veg plants their party and their

669
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,019
breeding there to live in life so

670
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,670
they're just colonizing and they are

671
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:51,150
expanding with the grow they become a

672
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:53,500
part of the girl you create a symbiosis

673
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:56,140
that's what happens outside that's what

674
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,579
happens in nature if you get bug a bug

675
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,200
bee will come along and say hey look a

676
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,909
bunch of these and it'll eat it then

677
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,769
they'll either move along or they'll try

678
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,269
to colonize if they get too much if they

679
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:06,579
get too comfortable they get too fancy

680
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:08,289
bug seal come along it's eight now bro

681
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,819
this is our territory and they'll eat

682
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,379
bug bee and they'll run them off and

683
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:12,639
then those bugs will either move along

684
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,710
to the next guard and they keep playing

685
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,509
security that way or they'll repeat the

686
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,039
process they'll try to hang out they'll

687
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:19,809
run out of bugs to eat and they'll die

688
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,279
or they'll leave or something will come

689
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:23,799
and eat them that's how it happens in

690
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,480
nature we can replicate that in our grow

691
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:28,419
rooms if we use a well-thought-out

692
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,559
integrated pest management strategy now

693
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,900
something you're going to have to be

694
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,879
careful with is our

695
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,860
pesticides you are using going to

696
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,230
endanger your predators that you're

697
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:38,939
paying money for in a lot of commercial

698
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,890
environments I will start the mother

699
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,380
rooms and the bedrooms by using

700
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,360
pesticide applications as we move into

701
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,000
the later bedrooms in the flower areas

702
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,609
and will begin releasing large amounts

703
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,109
of predator bugs my budget may be a

704
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,579
little bit different than most people's

705
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:56,759
because I'm working on a commercial

706
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:58,949
scale also the value of my crop is more

707
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,690
critical than some folks because I am

708
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,430
working on a large commercial scale I'm

709
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:04,170
not downplaying the size of your garden

710
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,700
I'm just saying that we have to be a

711
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,620
little more careful we're going to lose

712
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,390
hundreds of pounds compared to somebody

713
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:11,339
losing one or two pounds in a home girl

714
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,750
yes you're out of medicine but if I lose

715
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,599
hundreds of pounds people are out of

716
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,420
jobs businesses fail it is a very huge

717
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,699
loss so my strategy is to go very hard

718
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,920
on the moms go very hard in the veg

719
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,930
phase make sure I do not get any pests

720
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,570
any pathogens any problems throughout

721
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,279
that cycle late in veg or right at the

722
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:31,619
start of flower I start adjusting my

723
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,149
pesticide application schedule to make

724
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,039
sure I'm not applying anything that will

725
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:38,009
be harmful or detrimental to my predator

726
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:41,069
bugs then I like to switch to releasing

727
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:43,109
large ridiculous amounts of predatory

728
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:44,819
mites so I've got that residual

729
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:47,099
pesticide hanging out for a couple of

730
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:48,779
weeks then that starts to degrade then

731
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,089
by the time all that pesticide breaks

732
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:52,289
down is no longer active on my plants my

733
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:54,419
predatory mites have had time to

734
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:56,069
colonize I've got a big army in there

735
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,110
and I've still got protection I know

736
00:25:56,069 --> 00:26:00,269
that I don't have any chance for spider

737
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,129
mites or anything like that to come take

738
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:03,869
a hold in my garden so you've got a

739
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,520
couple of options for this strategy you

740
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,529
can either start by letting the

741
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,000
predatory mites go in the mom room get

742
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,599
them in the veg room get them started

743
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,819
early

744
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,740
get them colonizing or you can start

745
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:15,119
with pesticides early then when you move

746
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,890
to the flowering phase when it's no

747
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,599
longer a good idea to spray you can

748
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,160
start releasing your predatory mites and

749
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,529
start working things that way you've got

750
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,150
a few things to think about but I think

751
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:26,069
with all the information I've given you

752
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,440
we should be able to get rid of those

753
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:30,000
white flies let's talk more specifically

754
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,590
about some of the predatory bugs that

755
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,839
you could use and then we were gonna get

756
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,970
out of here for this episode I really

757
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,250
appreciate lace wings in a garden

758
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,650
I feel like lace wings are hungry and

759
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,329
aggressive I am most familiar with the

760
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,070
lace wings that come in the eggs that

761
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:44,460
are on the black sheet that you hang in

762
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,079
there

763
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,910
locations throughout the grow those are

764
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,799
what I'm most familiar with I like to

765
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,750
watch them come alive they turn into a

766
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,039
little crocodile looking thing and then

767
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,769
eventually they turn into a green

768
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,750
lacewing those things are hungry

769
00:26:55,769 --> 00:27:00,240
they're so hungry that I believe they

770
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:02,430
become carnivorous they will eat every

771
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,740
pest in your garden then they will turn

772
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:07,320
on their friends and family so green

773
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,630
lace wings are awesome in any garden

774
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,250
then the next predatory mite that I

775
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,070
would recommend their works on a

776
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:17,220
plethora of garden pests is the sworsky

777
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:19,319
predatory mite I release sworsky mites

778
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,000
on a regular basis in any commercial

779
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,970
grow environment that I am responsible

780
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,759
for I can also recommend hookah Marys

781
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,650
and my new pirate bugs now predatory

782
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,539
mites can get a little bit expensive but

783
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,519
if all you've got our mother plants you

784
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,339
have a great opportunity to start

785
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,869
colonies in a small garden so now all

786
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:38,789
you've got to do is hang up some yellow

787
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:39,539
sticky traps defoliate like a

788
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:42,029
[ __ ]

789
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:44,549
do some research on several pesticides

790
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:47,129
select the few that work for you create

791
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:49,889
a nice rotation of pesticides start

792
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,260
applying them diligently until you knock

793
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,730
down that population then decide how you

794
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:55,500
want to proceed are you going to keep

795
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,880
going with the pesticides or are you

796
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,220
going to start using some sort of

797
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,960
predators you also need to seal up that

798
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,279
room and figure out where those bugs are

799
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,319
coming from you've got a very small

800
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:06,149
crack somewhere they have found that

801
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,559
crack and they are making their way in

802
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,570
so we've got to figure out how to seal

803
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,099
that up but I think we can get rid of

804
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:12,240
these white flies white flies aren't as

805
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:13,619
big of a problem as they seem like

806
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,269
they're more of a pain in the ass

807
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:17,399
they're more ugly they're more annoying

808
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:18,900
than anything else but if we stay on top

809
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,400
of it we will get them out of your

810
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,440
garden hey I want to thank you for a

811
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,150
great email if anybody else out there

812
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,100
has a grow question I would love to help
