did enjoy it but like i said i don't

68
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040

70
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,500

now this is the 4 21 show

76
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:24,239
uh there is a special significance for

77
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,239
420 and 421 in the rastafari culture

78
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
i got some good friends to teach us

79
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,000
about it big shout out to my friends

80
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,878
who came from kingston jamaica to teach

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,400
us about

82
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,000
420 and 421 in rastafari culture

83
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,920
a couple of things i should mention

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,479
before we roll that clip

85
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,159
uh there are a lot of sounds of jamaica

86
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,518
in the background they are not recording

87
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,519
in a recording studio

88
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,879
they are recording in a banana field in

89
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,879
kingston jamaica

90
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,560
so you will hear birds you will hear

91
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,878
dogs you may hear a car

92
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,000
you may hear some jamaican reggae music

93
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,560
in the background

94
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,639
uh it is the natural sound of jamaica i

95
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,239
enjoy it i appreciated it

96
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,079
bob and i were having some scheduling

97
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,840
conflicts i was actually out of town for

98
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,959
the 4 20 weekend and a couple of days

99
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,959
before that

100
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,199
uh bob was trying to record with me then

101
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,439
also bob's got that beautiful

102
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,119
jamaican internet so his internet wasn't

103
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,318
really super strong at some times in a

104
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,158
zoo meeting kind of

105
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,598
goes wonky a little bit so bob was kind

106
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,519
enough to set up a camera

107
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,199
grab a rastafari elder big thanks and

108
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,959
big respect to the rastafari elder who

109
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,199
appeared on camera for us to teach us

110
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,719
a lot about rastafari and 420 and the

111
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,798
correlation

112
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,799
but bob grabbed the camera they pressed

113
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,519
record and they recorded a segment to

114
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,560
teach us

115
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,039
about the importance of 420 and 421 to

116
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,080
jamaica and rosters and rastafari across

117
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,479
jamaica

118
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,760
um this will raise some questions you

119
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,759
guys will have a lot of questions if

120
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,199
you're not familiar with rasta culture

121
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,120

this show brings up

130
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,238
you guys i feel like i'm rambling i said

131
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,158
i wasn't going to do that

132
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,000
so with no further ado let's bring in

133
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,560
the segment with rasta bob and his

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,519
friend

135
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,519
from jamaica

136
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,200
let's say the record game

137
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,160
all right so the importance of 420 to

138
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,319
rastafari it's trying to show the

139
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,880
international community that

140
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,079
you know just thinking about the visit

141
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,879
of his majesty

142
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,519
on the 21st and the year that it

143
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,959
happened

144
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,719
i think it was a 63. six 66

145
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,599
right so thinking back in jamaica's

146
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,680
history but then ganja was super

147
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,840
illegal criminalized you know where

148
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
rasta was being beaten and you know

149
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,319
you know eventually it was very hard

150
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,240
time where people would take on the

151
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,800
grandchild but that day i knew it's

152
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,918
particular it was almost like it was

153
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,079
free

154
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,319
that day you know i hear people talking

155
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,159
about thousands of charlie santos and

156
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,560
jaspreef and

157
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,240
urban police not knowing what to do they

158
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,038
actually gave a free-for-all they didn't

159
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
even was

160
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:08,159
concerned about ganja

161
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,120
and that day 420 in the preparation

162
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,120
you know intensity for his visit of his

163
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,319
imperial majesty the following day the

164
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,160
21st

165
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,519
so i'll just kind of open if you could

166
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039

167

168
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,759
what we now know as 420.

169
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,120
didn't exist until perhaps a decade or a

170
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,560
little less than a decade

171
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,240
after 1966 which is when his majesty

172
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,038
came to jamaica

173
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,400
now the important visit of his majesty

174
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,719
started

175
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:46,959
from the 18th of april in trinidad

176
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,080
which was his first stop but by the 21st

177
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,319
of april he was on his way to jamaica

178
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,680
now jamaica had declared a public

179
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,199
holiday

180
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,720
for the 21st of april 1966

181
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,120
to meet the arrival of his majesty

182
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,360
what that meant is that rastafari who

183
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,560
was still very much

184
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,759
the outcast in jamaica started to

185
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,199
mobilize themselves on the 20th

186
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:19,038
so the 20th became a major mobilization

187
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,600
day for rastafari and

188
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,159
if you remember that at those in those

189
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,919
days rastafari couldn't take a bus

190
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,120
and didn't have certain kind of access

191
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,799
so the accounts of various bedrooms that

192
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
they started to walk

193
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,918
from all over the island into the

194
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,799
gullies through the hope valley

195
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,000
in an effort to get out by the airport

196
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,120
and in so doing

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,959
they were also sure that a part of the

198
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,079
celebration was ganja

199
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:51,038
so part of the account of his majesty

200
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,639
is people actually came out with her

201
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:56,000
branches

202
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:59,280
palm leaves ganja big star

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,079
yeah as as parts of the celebration of

204
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,198
this

205
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,959
ancient um king who would now touch down

206
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,478
on the jamaican land what it meant is

207
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,758
that

208
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:15,519
rastafari who whole ganja as

209
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,960
a part of the connection to divine

210
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:21,758
wanted to incense create a

211
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,519
a herb atmosphere to receive the

212
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,639
solomonic king because you know

213
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:29,198
as far as we are concerned uh ganja is a

214
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,160
part of that solomonic legacy

215
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,319
a part of our lore is that it is the

216
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,360
herb that emerges from the tomb of

217
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,039
solomon

218
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,479
after he passes so in receiving this

219
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,918
king

220
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:46,159
and in keeping with our fire element

221
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,439
because fire is an element that is very

222
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,560
much central

223
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:56,399
to rastafari experience and in lieu of

224
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,439
building a fire key and holding an ayah

225
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,239
the ritual of ganja becomes the

226
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:05,839
embodiment of that fire principle

227
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,038
so what is said is that brethren

228
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:12,799
stormed the tarmac blazing

229
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:17,038
chalice and issuing smoke or incense

230
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,560
of her ganja and the official

231
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,878
protocol could do nothing but just

232
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,918
silently observe they couldn't

233
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,080
choose to arrest our in any way abuse

234
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,279
rastafari which still was very much

235
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,279
standard because

236
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,478
if you remember three years before his

237
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,679
majesty arrived in jamaica

238
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,879
we had a major rastafari repression in

239
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,359
the cardinals incident in 1963

240
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,439
so a part of our conversation is that

241
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,839
his majesty actually come

242
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,959
three years later to check on ironi

243
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,560
particularly

244
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,039
well i don't know i don't i don't want

245
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,000
yesterday from there so that's why 63

246
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,439
was sticking out

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,440
in my brain so the coral gardens

248
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,120
incident was really just in summary for

249
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
all the viewers and listeners

250
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,639
was just where the state itself for my

251
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
overstanding

252
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,039
the government issued a decree that you

253
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,120
know a terrible attraction

254
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,559
yeah kill them kill them on site beat

255
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,399
them kill them and

256
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,079
it wasn't even the police and the

257
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,080
soldiers that were given that that are

258
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,200
character i heard that even the

259
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,200
excellence of society yeah the public

260
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
but i get your point um the real thing

261
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,879
is that

262
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,120
herb became a major part of how

263
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,519
rastafarian mobilized

264
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,959
the day before his majesty arrives right

265
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,519
so in our mind

266
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:49,278
the the real beginning of 420

267
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,919
is our overnight vision in

268
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,439
receiving his majesty now i know 420

269
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,159
also has a time

270
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,680
issue as a culture operating around a

271
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,958
certain time of the day

272
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:03,838
for this herb sacrament and i i wouldn't

273
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,119
necessarily claim that rastafari needed

274
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,720
that kind of

275
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,720
retreat that the 420 space that emerges

276
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,959
in the 70s among

277
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,639
mummies and you know a range of people

278
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:19,439
who are trying to have this

279
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:22,480
break for us herb is not a break

280
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,519
it is a part of our

281
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,680
consistent communing you know um

282
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,519
in in some instances people talk about

283
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,000
micro dosing well

284
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,959
it is our micro dosing throughout the

285
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,759
day

286
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,359
if we are allowed to uh because it

287
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,639
doesn't impair

288
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,680
it in fact we develop the kind of

289
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,958
training where herb becomes a necessary

290
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,239
sort of nutrient to fuel and keep our

291
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,078
work moving

292
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,839
and we come out of that space where

293
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:58,319
herb infused work becomes

294
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,200
clearly a demonstration of our

295
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,720
spirituality and our philosophy

296
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,440
in fact some people think that they

297
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,240
can't work unless the heavens have been

298
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,519
set

299
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,000
um correctly in this herb space so our

300
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,959
herb approach is not necessarily

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,480
driven by an oar even though we do have

302
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,439
that kind of approach

303
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,920
where people would have a morning cup as

304
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,959
a way of setting themselves

305
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,159
for the day and then you know they might

306
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,159
want one

307
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,639
midday um certainly after work

308
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,799
and that is usually now i suppose more

309
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,159
in keeping with that idea of 420

310
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:41,359
that after work unwinding usually

311
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,120
um in a congregation that's when well i

312
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
think i think it does more the school

313
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,519
has that again after school you know 420

314
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
that was really the old high school that

315
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,000
was when you know school is otalica

316
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,440
early

317
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,839
so 4 20 well you know link up some night

318
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,480
school

319
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,200
yeah so it's not

320
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,440
you know targeted for a specific time

321
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,440
frame but maybe an aluminum cycle right

322
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,200
around it's more you know interwoven

323
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,360
within that tradition so just the world

324
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,278
far 420 i know the celebrations going

325
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,000
out so i just wanted to give a like

326
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,399
you know heights in terms of what that

327
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
day

328
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,159
420 represented for rastafarian the

329
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
different

330
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,439
celebratory preparation kind of aspect

331
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,159
that it would mean so 420 begin with us

332
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,959
in in principle just based on the

333
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,399
importance of the arrival of his majesty

334
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:34,239
it is a major anniversary of our

335
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,320
