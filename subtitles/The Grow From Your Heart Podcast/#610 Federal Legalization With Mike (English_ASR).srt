are taunting us and teasing us with the

146

idea with the allure of

147
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
federal cannabis legalization so i

148
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400

149
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,560

156
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
however most the time i got the gross to

157
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
figure out mike is my uh political guy

158

169
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,320
about though is uh the coolest thing

170
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
people are going to be let out of prison

171
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,399
in some states people are already

172
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,478
being let out already cannabis crimes if

173
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,918
you're in prison for cannabis possession

174
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,519
or something involving cannabis people

175
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,519
are being let out

176
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,120
that's amazing to me dude that is super

177
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,680
cool

178
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,399
uh it's fantastic whether that's part of

179
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,120
the federal legalization bill we'll see

180
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,079
um hopefully it is uh cory booker is one

181
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,879
of the three main

182
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,599
people um leading this charge right now

183
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,560
or at least

184
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,759
leading this tease right now um and i

185
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
know that it's something near and dear

186
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,800
to his heart so

187
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
we might see some of that coming down

188
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,759
the pipe federally but it's definitely

189
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,840
happening in different

190
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,439
different states around the country it's

191
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,159
beautiful to see it's not happening in

192
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,240
your state

193
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,919
right your governor yeah especially if

194
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,439
you have legal cannabis there and there

195
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,319
are still i'm going to say that a lot

196
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,600
this episode

197
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,360
you are all right it's going to that

198
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,879
might just be the name of the episode

199
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,400
but if you're in a legal cannabis state

200
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,439
and there are still people locked up for

201
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,638
cannabis crimes there

202
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,918
what's the word mike when we start

203
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,199
letting people out for things that they

204
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,639
did in the past what's the word they're

205
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
the term for that

206
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,400
humanity yeah okay there's a technical

207
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,639
prison word the legal term

208
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,399
um yeah i've been written that's better

209
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
something like that you get [ __ ]

210
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,318
freedom bro you get let out of prison

211
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
uh because what you did wasn't a crime

212
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
and the rules have changed where now we

213
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,800
feel that it's more humane exactly to

214
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,919
let you out and let you go back

215
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
play with your family be with your

216
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,038
friends so i think it's beautiful we're

217
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,560
out here smoking

218
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,318
there are dispensaries why should people

219
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
be in jail for something that

220
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,600
some 19 year old girl is [ __ ] doing

221
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,439
right over the counter and making a job

222
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,000
and making tax money doing it when

223
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,759
there's guys there or other women also

224
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
in jail for [ __ ] doing exactly what

225
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,000
people are doing at the store now so i

226
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,000
think it's great that people are going

227
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,800
to get freed that's beautiful

228
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,279
it it's definitely hard to defend

229
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,759
keeping someone in jail for selling pot

230
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,079
when they have stores on the corner

231
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,280
absolutely that are paying for schools

232
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:40,800
and it just doesn't make any sense so

233
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,638
um states like colorado and washington

234
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,478
that didn't lead with some of that in

235
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,439
our laws are going back

236
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,279
retroactively now in correcting that

237
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,240
continued mistake that we left on the

238
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,559
books

239
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,319
other states i think illinois is one

240
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,000
that they're uh

241
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,759
made that a main piece of their law and

242
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,079
they're at least trying

243
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,680
um and there's a ton of states not just

244
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,159
federally right now which is sort of the

245
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,598
main

246
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
focus of the show but there are a lot of

247
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,719
individual states that have dragged

248
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,799
their feet on

249
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,400
medical and recreational legalization

250
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
that are now saying

251
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,399
all right everybody around us has

252
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,919
already done it if you have you know

253
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,519
only have to drive two states over to

254
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,639
get it it doesn't make sense so we don't

255
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,758
have it here too

256
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,680
absolutely yeah and i read one i can't

257
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,280
remember which politician but it was a

258
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,598
southern red state

259
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,478
prohibition state politician whose quote

260
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,399
was

261
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,680
if they'll drive to the next state over

262
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,359
to get fireworks

263
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
they're going to drive the the next

264
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,800
state over to buy cannabis

265
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,079
that we might as well just have it here

266
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,960
yeah and it's

267
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,560
it it's a little sillier than that in

268
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,959
reality because there's already plenty

269
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,280
of

270
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,318
marijuana for sale everywhere everywhere

271
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,559
but

272
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,319
not everybody has a hookup not legally i

273
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,598
like to use my mom as an example my mom

274
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,879
doesn't shop at the dispatch she's my

275
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,439
mom she wouldn't need the shop but

276
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,400
if my mom wanted to buy cannabis i

277
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,160
wouldn't want her to go

278
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,000
find one of the guys in the hood i'd

279
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,160
much rather her go to the store

280
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,038
she's gonna get what she pays for with a

281
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
receipt

282
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,639
uh i like to say that it's gonna be lab

283
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,160
tested and clean and all that but with

284
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,360
the dispensary reports we've been seeing

285
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,319
that could be a totally different

286
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,960
episode but

287
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,400
yeah so i agree that if my mom had to

288
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,239
had a life-threatening condition

289
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,560
somebody in her position they'd drive

290
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,918
uh two hours or four hours to another

291
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,839
state to get it other than go

292
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,439
plenty of people doing it yeah it's

293
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,038
easier for her to risk getting arrested

294
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,360
and crossing state lines than it is to

295
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,120
go

296
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,560
into the hood and and i keep keep saying

297
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,879
the hood just to put the mental image in

298
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,759
there

299
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,918
i love that argument i used to make um

300
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,719
in front of city council regularly

301
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,519
the people who everyone agree should

302
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,080
have

303
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,918
ready access to cannabis like uh

304
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,519
somebody's grandma with cancer was

305
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,360
always my example

306
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,120
everybody agrees that she should have

307
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
access to it

308
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,278
everybody kind of understands that she

309
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,360
might not be able to grow it herself

310
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,240
everybody understands that if she goes

311
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,519
to her doctor and gets that diagnosis

312
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,600
it's unreasonable to say just suffer

313
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,600
through the chemo for nine months while

314
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,959
you learn to grow your first crop

315
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,080
and then maybe enjoy some relief almost

316
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,399
a year down the road

317
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
maybe you'll have reasonable to grow the

318
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,399
crop while you're going through chemo

319
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,159
maybe you'll uh have a successful crop

320
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,639
you know like yeah so many maybes in

321
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,000
there

322
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,080
all right michael let's get this back

323
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
she was always my example for like why

324
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
we should have a store everywhere though

325
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,839
yeah

326
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,799
yeah there were uh working at that

327
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,560
dispensary in 2007 and 2008 showed me so

328
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,199
many people that were shining examples

329
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,199
of why

330
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,480
medical cannabis should be widely

331
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,160
available and affordable

332
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,680
for people we were trying to hook

333
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,360
everybody up the best we could and we

334
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,559
were a profitable business while still

335
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,240
giving away

336
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,319
large quantities of product so i know

337
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,959
that it's all the new licensing and [ __ ]

338
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
but still

339
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,079
we were doing it all right i want to put

340
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,120
us back on track i do have some

341
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
questions here

342
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,879
uh and i can kind of segue into this uh

343
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
what else happens if we federally

344
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,080
legalize mike you're my guy to ask all

345
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,159
these silly questions so

346
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,879
right now literally everything's up in

347
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,919
the air um

348
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,799
the democrats have control of the the

349
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,919
presidency

350
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,759
the house and the senate um

351
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,519
and you have to get all three of those

352
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,120
to agree to pass any new law like

353
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,959
federal legalization

354
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,959
so they built hotels on park place and

355
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,000
boardwalk basically

356
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,719
yeah and the hotels the pro the

357
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,078
the the hitch here is democrats suck

358
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,800
with power

359
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,278
um their first idea is always let's take

360
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,439
all the republican ideas first

361
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,039
and that usually leads to getting little

362
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
to nothing done

363
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,639
and that's what i'm afraid is gonna

364
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,679
happen here it's still sort of

365
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,039
monumental

366
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:42,078
that this upfront

367
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:45,199
in a new presidential term they're

368
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:48,239
already talking about stuff that's this

369
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,000
culture worry like we're also 40 years

370
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,399
too late on this but as far as politics

371
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,078
is concerned especially in the us

372
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,519
legalizing cannabis is oh my god i can't

373
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,759
believe you're bringing that up that's

374
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,440
insane

375
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,600
whereas everybody in the public is like

376
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,640
this has made sense for 30 years now it

377
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,839
should have happened right

378
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,879
30 years ago well they're at least

379
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,320
talking about it

380
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,278
the upside is a lot a lot of people are

381
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,040
interested in it

382
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,039
and nothing's set yet they haven't said

383
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,639
what they think it'll look like if

384
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,719
they're talking about just moving

385
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,838
cannabis from schedule one to schedule

386
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,839
three

387
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,680
if they're talking about descheduling it

388
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,720
off the um

389
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:33,919
narcotics list completely all of that

390
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,360
changes what's possible on the ground

391
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,360
where we interact with people

392
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,839
they could just move it to schedule from

393
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,479
schedule 1 to schedule 3

394
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,120
which would mean better access to

395
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,839
medical research

396
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,078
doctors would be potentially able to

397
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,399
actually conduct human trials

398
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:58,559
so we could give people better dosages

399
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,720
develop better designer drugs to treat

400
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,518
different ailments

401
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,680
but it wouldn't really allow for the

402
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,360
anybody can grow cannabis and sell it to

403
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,159
their friend without incurring

404
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,480
the wrath of the local police department

405
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,838
um type legalization that we all know

406
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
should exist

407
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,240
that was going to be it should be like

408
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,879
tomatoes kind of guy

409
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,519
right like a little it should be kept a

410
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,078
little secure than tomatoes because like

411
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,759
if an animal or a human gets into it

412
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,519
like it can lead to some problems

413
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,360
especially if it's like a kid or a dog

414
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,240
or whatever but yeah

415
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,919
um and that's less true with tomatoes

416
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,120
like is all so like just put a better

417
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,399
fence around it to keep

418
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,639
little kids and dogs out of it but

419
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,399
that's probably not going to happen

420
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,680
politically at least not anytime

421
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,879
soon i think the best we can hope for

422
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,000
is a system kind of like colorado's

423
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,120
where it's a little too

424
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,958
expensive to get in and it's much more

425
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,399
restrictive than it should be but

426
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,039
it's a hell of a lot better than

427
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,799
everything that's come before right

428
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,319
just stop arresting people for having

429
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,039
cannabis in a lot of places would be a

430
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
huge step

431
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,000
start letting people out of prison would

432
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,600
be a huge step then let us grow our own

433
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,839
medicine would be huge

434
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,278
the numbers are astronomical i mean

435
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,200
we're still arresting

436
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,278
like half a million or more people a

437
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,720
year for cannabis crimes

438
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:24,078
and that's like growing moving

439
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,160
consuming distributing

440
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,000
basic [ __ ] with any product it's how

441
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,480
we've been living for the last

442
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,240
20 years how many law enforcement still

443
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
how many law enforcement hours were

444
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,000
required to make those that many

445
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,360
yeah what could those cops be doing with

446
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,198
that many hours that's a different

447
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,560
episode but still

448
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,198
i did the math in colorado it worked out

449
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,838
to like

450
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,399
entire years so like a whole cop's

451
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,399
career

452
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,000
you could dedicate to other stuff like

453
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,839
the numbers get really big

454
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,320
really fast when you start doing the all

455
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,839
right it's two hours per arrest and

456
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,839
we did 750 000 arrests this year

457
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,040
the that's a million and a half cop

458
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,240
hours

459
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,399
and then you add in the cop the court

460
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,079
the detention officer the parole officer

461
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,320
the urine test people

462
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,599
the money for all of that and what we

463
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,399
could have done with that

464
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
that would have helped us a lot more

465
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
right

466
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,078
like the when you start talking to

467
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,919
politicians that

468
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,599
aren't interested in legalization or

469
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,120
think it's a dumb idea

470
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
and you start presenting some of the

471
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,879
numbers you know well in our state

472
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,879
here's how many people we arrest and

473
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,799
here's how much that can cost us and

474
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,838
what if we use that money to

475
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:41,439
unfuck up the roads or build schools

476
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,880
or do drug treatment or

477
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,760
homeless outreach or cleaning buildings

478
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,519
[ __ ] crap yeah like it's sort of

479
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,600
endless the list of

480
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,560
needs that your area doesn't matter

481
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,440
where in the us

482
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,479
you are your area needs a lot of stuff

483
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,079
bad

484
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,519
and if you go to the city council

485
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,399
meetings or

486
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,759
um town halls you'll hear that

487
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,639
continuously

488
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,919
we here's the problem it's gonna cost 10

489
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,799
bucks to fix it

490
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,399
we only have three bucks only 80 cents

491
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,799
can go towards that problem

492
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,198
that's how everything goes and if you

493
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,759
can stand up and go i know a way that we

494
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,039
could bring

495
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,278
in 40 million dollars a year

496
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,879
everybody stops and goes how you like

497
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,480
pot

498
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,480
and they kind of giggle and go show me

499
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,920
the numbers yeah and you do and all of a

500
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
sudden you've got five people who are

501
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,399
against you this morning

502
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,600

we get it going

504
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,199
which brings me back to write some

505
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,680

506
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,120
um your senators your house of

507
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,958
representative

508
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,519
members if you don't know who they are

509
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,958
you can google it really fast

510
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,078
um emailing them is super easy

511
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,838
um for example i could google john

512
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,359
hickenlooper

513
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,759
it would come up with his name it would

514
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,879
show me he's a senator for colorado

515
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,039
i click send him an email it opens up a

516
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,480
box i just type what i want and click

517
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,759
send hour and a half later i get a form

518
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,079
email back saying

519
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,480
the office has received your email we

520
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,479
appreciate your correspondence

521
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,720
maybe two weeks later you get an email

522
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,759
from a staffer that says

523
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,120
he's interested in this issue here's how

524
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,278
end of email it's sort of

525
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,639
arbitrary especially if it's just one

526
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,838
person doing it

527
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,680
but if 10 000 people all send an email

528
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,120
that's what they end up talking about at

529
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,879
every meeting

530
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,799
was your inbox flooded with people

531
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,439
emailing about federal legalization

532
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,399
again

533
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,000
yep what do they all want well they all

534
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,360
say we definitely have to let everybody

535
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,399

536
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,360
cannabis crimes go let them all out

537

so write those letters what everything

540
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,919

544
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,360
just derail this and let's see what mike

545
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,558

546
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,480
yeah oh first let everybody go everybody

547
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,918
you caught up and hassled over cannabis

548
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,078
let them go

549
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,720
um two make that not a probable cause

550
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,279
for [ __ ] all ever again

551
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,240
i never want to see another video or

552
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,558
have

553
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,959
an interaction with law enforcement that

554
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,678
starts getting escalated with

555
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,160
i detect the smell of cannabis or i

556
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,919
detect the smell of burning marijuana

557
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,759
like i just i never want to hear those

558
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,960
words ever again

559
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,879
um i want to see cannabis stores in all

560
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,798
50 states

561
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,840
um and i'd really really really

562
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,720
like some of the money to go to youth

563
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,159
programs okay

564
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,120
that's all cool i like that i can expect

565
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,840
i can respect all of that i'm in just a

566
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,839
good way to

567
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,439
just kind of ask you what you thought

568
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,720
federal would be awesome

569
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,798
i'm hoping like i'm really hoping places

570
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,640
like colorado that went overboard with

571
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,879
our rules and regs

572
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,640
dial them way back with federal

573
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,000
legalization

574
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,640
i'm like there's no reason we should

575
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,359
have a an eighth store cap across our

576
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,240
city

577
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,079
right or a full-on moratorium on new

578
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,880
cannabis businesses in the county

579
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,159
or 32 layers of paper packaging before i

580
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,520
could take a dab

581
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,919
yep or all the licensing

582
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,599
like some of that shit's necessary like

583
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,440
i don't want the extraction people

584
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,439
randomly blowing up a whole

585
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,360
seven people right like i don't want

586
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,038
that to happen a bunch of times and so

587
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,798
let's make sure the fire department

588
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,558
gets in there first and make sure

589
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,679
everything's safe and up to code and the

590
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,440
walls aren't [ __ ]

591
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:49,120
ply board and you know but

592
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,240
for the most part like

593
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,119
do i like tomatoes do it like craft

594
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
breweries

595
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,199
that's you know model i like it's like

596
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,320
craft beer

597
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,679
i i'd like to say it's cannabis is

598
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,038
a flower it's a medicine and it's an

599
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,798
intoxicant

600
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,038
and we sell flowers medicines and

601
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,960
intoxicants every [ __ ] day in every

602
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:14,480
city on every street corner

603
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,038
we can figure out a way to comfortably

604
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,360
just

605
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,440
produce and distribute cannabis we just

606
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,639
gotta stop pretending it's that hard and

607
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,160
just do it

608
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,080
we're pretty good at it here in colorado

609
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,400
mike you and i put a lot of cannabis out

610
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,519
uh allegedly before cannabis was doing

611
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,600
stuff a lot of our

612
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,879
alter egos may have allegedly had a lot

613
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,558
of cannabis happening and then we got in

614
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,559
the legal market and

615
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,079
exponentially multiplied the amount of

616
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,000
cannabis we're putting out there we

617
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,319
had a good time in the legal market the

618
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,119
gray market in the legal markets were

619
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:46,000
like when the period of time where

620
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,879
states were afraid to make rules

621
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,279
um people forget the history really fast

622
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,720
when

623
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:56,399
colorado was just medical

624
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,759
the feds were saying i dare you

625
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,759
to allow this i [ __ ] dare you

626
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,960
they were still raiding dispensaries

627
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,038
left and right with

628
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,720
federal agents where the dea would show

629
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,359
up and smash everything and take

630
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,960
everything

631
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,839
and some people would end up in jail for

632
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,759
the night and then nothing

633
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,759
because the the locals knew that they

634
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,279
couldn't get a jury to convict

635
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,679
and so the feds would just seize

636
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,519
everything and go away and it was

637
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,440
like getting robbed but you couldn't

638
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,798
call the cops because it was the federal

639
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,919
police that robbed you

640
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:31,359
yep um there was a lot of that there was

641
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,280
uh the cert or the drugs are the united

642
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,479
states saying he would take a doctor's

643
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,678
ability to prescribe

644
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,798
narcotics yeah if that doctor talked

645
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,720
not recommended not prescribed

646
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:47,119
just discussed with the patient

647
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
the use of cannabis for their ailment

648
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,319

state federal all of them especially if

671
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,200
you're still in a prohibition state

672
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,360
there's a lot of places where

673
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,960
cannabis is just as illegal as it was

674
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:42,319
when we were teenagers

675
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,720
and that's crazy it's 20 21.

676
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,279
the fact that some people can drive to

677
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,319
the corner store and grab

678
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,599
an ounce of herb and go home and other

679
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,879
people

680
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,719
can go to jail for decades

681
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
for having that ounce for sale it's just

682
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,240
insane okay

683
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
three grams of the finest concentrates

684
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,798
on the planet right here in front of me

685
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,000
and if we drove

686
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,879
uh 10 hours that way this would be

687
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,159
completely

688
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,679
completely a major crime and if

689
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,000
if you all start having these

690
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,919
discussions conversations with

691
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,599
elected representatives in your area and

692
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,240
you get any pushback

693
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,000
by all means send the show an email and

694
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,400

732
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
lost the thread and then i took another

733
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,319
hit off this pen and now we're here

734

yeah i took a hit off my bowl here and

735
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,399
got lost as well that's why we're trying

736
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,278
to regroup now here

737
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,798

738
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:45,200
the air nothing has been solved there's

739
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,839
no

740
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,319
uh real [ __ ] rules there's not even a

741
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,720
proposal or a bill yet yeah as

742
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,759
that paranoid guy who has always been

743
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,360
like uh i

744
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,119
i liked the black market because i

745
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,879
thought when i knew that when

746
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,199
legalization came here in

747
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,159
colorado that it would be cool at first

748
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,919
and then it would be over

749
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,520
regulated man and that's the word we all

750
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,520
like to use it's just the paranoid

751
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,200
conspiracy theory [ __ ] wookiee that's

752
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,639
just straight up what we did that's an

753
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,038
accurate description of life in

754
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,919
colorado's cannabis market

755
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,879
well no i'm paranoid and do you think

756
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,240
that

757
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,720
i've got two questions here this could

758
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,440
go to uh do you think this will be the

759
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,759
lead to

760
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,679
like the dispensary taking over the

761
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,200
dispensaries and the grows and the

762
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,240
entire cannabis market and then that

763
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,759
will lead to

764
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,960
who we will consider the devil of

765
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,319
cannabis do you think that will be

766
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,240
monsanto getting in

767
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:36,079
to grow the cannabis for the government

768
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,640
that's my paranoia

769
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,240
um well the government already grows

770
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,200
cannabis they like the university of

771
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,640

789
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,319
run some cameras through that [ __ ] or

790
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,359
something just to show that i was there

791
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,399
you know what i mean that's all i just

792
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:16,158

793
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,400

794
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,679
bring mike as my uh backup guy to take

795
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,278
notes and help me out and [ __ ] he's my

796
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,759
handler because i've got this add issue

797
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:23,519
but

798
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,440
uh yeah you're gonna need someone like

799
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,119
me explain to the government you're not

800
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,880
to be arrested that's the truth

801
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,158
i gotta bring mike as my legal backup

802
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,278
but you guys hire me i'll help you out

803
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,880
all right mike let's keep going now the

804
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,319
government does grow weed but that [ __ ]

805
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,039
sucks and they need [ __ ] husbands

806
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:40,720
super bad it's it's so bad i almost

807
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:42,158
think it's a ploy like they have to keep

808
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,400
giving researchers dog

809
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,320
food because if they had real product

810
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,600
they would see the medical benefits like

811
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,798
the rest of us do

812
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,079
right um but they're straight up cutting

813
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:53,359
plants out of the ground and shoving

814
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,119
them through wood chippers and calling

815
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,759
that fine herb

816
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,158
um i know a shop that does that so i

817
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,440
wish

818
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:05,039
that was an exaggeration or hyperbole

819
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,919
um but uh

820
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,000
the major corporations will 100 percent

821
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,440
get involved they already are in canada

822
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,079
in a major way that's going to be my

823
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,120
next questions marlboro

824
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,119
is really a company

825
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,440
and uh they already have a substantial

826
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,880
investment in

827
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,798
canada um

828
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,440
i want to say it's budweiser it might be

829
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,200
a different beer of their tear though

830
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,240
i don't pay too much attention to canada

831
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,960
but canada marijuana investments

832
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,038
but the anti-cannabis crowd often

833
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,600
references these which is why i know it

834
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:45,119
is a talking point

835
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:47,759
but expect all of them to jump in

836
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,759
personally i'm not worried because i

837
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,679
know a couple things about cannabis that

838
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,599
they don't

839
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,400
one of those things is if you get the

840
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:59,199
thc percentage above

841
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,960
a certain point it will [ __ ] up a mass

842
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,319
production rolling machine like you will

843
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,798
not believe oh yeah

844
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,399
cannabis and tobacco are wildly

845
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,720
different plants

846
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,240
people that don't consume either assume

847
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,038
they're the same

848
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,278
with just slightly different effects as

849
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,558
a lover of both

850
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,000
they are wildly different and the

851
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,720
production and distribution

852
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,359
of them is also wildly different because

853
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
of that

854
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,639
hey that's a good time to interrupt you

855
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,558

866
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,558
pens

867
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,480
i used to get like a tiny little your

868
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,759
drinks way too hot

869
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,880
level sip out of them and then i would

870
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,359
cough

871
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,120
like i was trying to cough up a lung it

872
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,599
was so bad

873
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,759
um i'd get ripped that way it would just

874
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,000
take 30 coughing fits

875
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,038
now i you see me on the show if you're

876
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,240
watching it on youtube

877
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,079
at the start of the show rip it

878
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,079
continuously he took a dab at the start

879
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,240
of the show and was able to recover

880
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,158
through the before i was done rambling

881
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,399
through the intro so that was impressive

882
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
used to turn colors and [ __ ]

883
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,519
different shades of purple

884
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,399
but yeah you can really feel

885
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,200
how it in the lungs the year off tobacco

886
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:32,639

887
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,319
congrats buddy i'm proud of you i really

888
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,840
am thank you i know we totally derailed

889
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,200
the show to congratulate you

890
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,480
stroke your ego a little bit there but

891
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,640
i'm proud of you and excited for you

892
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,399
this had to be a ramble cast i was gone

893
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,399
for too long we both knew it was gonna

894
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,519
go off the rails repeatedly anybody

895
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:46,959
still enjoying this

896
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,480
knew it was too and they're cheering

897
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,440
every time it does oh we've been going

898
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,440
for probably like

899
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,798
30-ish minutes or so they're still

900
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,399
listening and they they like it when we

901
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,558
ramble the dab at the beginning took

902
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,079
away my ability to judge time i can't

903
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:59,038
tell if we've been here for five minutes

904
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,119
or three hours

905
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,038
uh i've got so many timers and things

906
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,959
happening on so many different devices

907
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,398
here that it's ridiculous

908
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,159
yeah i was setting up for a podcast i

909
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,079
was like bye i got a camera there i got

910
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,360
a macbook and lights and the ipad and

911
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,000
there's just so many things for this

912
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,519
show

913
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,798
i'm not i forgot how to zoom i haven't

914
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,359
done a zoom show in a minute it was kind

915
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:16,558
of fun

916
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,398
all right mike i want to put it back on

917
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,079
the rails what are the chances of us

918
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,918
getting homegrows if they do federally

919
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,879
legalize cannabis or do you think

920
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,440
pretty good okay that's gonna that would

921
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,278
be something the feds would

922
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,558
almost 100 percent leave up to the

923
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,079
states that's cool

924
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:37,038
um and that's sort of what we want

925
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,079
in a good federal legalization is a lot

926
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,319
of

927
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,918
their answers to questions like that are

928
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,038
going i don't [ __ ] care let the

929
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,520
states choose

930
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,200
so um and so it's going to end up

931
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,519
looking kind of like the liquor market

932
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,798
if

933
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,918
if i had to predict where states like

934
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,839
utah are

935
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,000
much more conservative with who can

936
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,119
produce it who can ship it who can sell

937
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,240
it and

938
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:05,439
states like um

939
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,079
louisiana can be much more

940
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,919
liberal with who can grow it sell it

941
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,278
distribute it all of that

942
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,960
it just depends on where you are and

943
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,079
what the locals want

944
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,919
um personally i'd i'd really like to see

945
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,918
like the craft beer industry anybody

946
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,799
with like eight grand and some good

947
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,880
credit

948
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,599
can get started in the industry i'd love

949
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,039
to to it to be at that level

950
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,639
but like i really think it needs

951
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,398
inspections and [ __ ] i don't know how

952
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,559
many people that listen to this show

953
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:34,398
saw there was a big report on baby food

954
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,879
that just came out

955
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,639
and if you if you think oh baby food

956
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,159
like if you sell baby food if that's

957
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,320
your bread and butter like you really

958
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,120
give a [ __ ] about what's in your product

959
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:47,119
but they're big business so guess what

960
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,879
they care about money

961
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,479
and that's all they care about and it

962
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,080
turns out that they've been feeding kids

963
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,599
horrible things for a long time and

964
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:57,199
getting away with it

965
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:59,119
um because it's profitable to do so

966
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,640
and so if the baby food company is going

967
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:01,359
to put [ __ ] in their food and sell it to

968
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,440
you

969
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,558
the cannabis company is going to of

970
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,159
course yeah

971
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:10,639
and as much as i

972
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,600
i always pretended when it was the black

973
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,000
market that

974
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,839
oh yeah this dude's all organic like

975
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,519
it's totally hippie grown

976
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,038
and it was all just a marketing thing

977
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,200
that i was told by whoever happened to

978
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,359
be so good to me that time

979
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,880
um and it was a comforting lie that we

980
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,639
all liked to tell each other and believe

981
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,240
but it was always [ __ ]

982
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,600
like any time you went to the grocery

983
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
store and asked a question they were

984
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,918
like oh

985
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,000
spray this toxic [ __ ] on it and you'll

986
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,000
be fine yep no you don't

987
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,599
they don't even mention ppe i was gonna

988
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
say dude i went there was a grow store i

989
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,639
won't mention them but they recommended

990
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,558
me probably 20 different products sold

991
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,120
them to me 20 different times never once

992
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:44,960
told me

993
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:47,038
never tried to sell me gloves a mask a

994
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,558
respirator a tyvek suit never

995
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,240
just a bunch of different not only is

996
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:51,599
that wildly irresponsible that's just

997
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,240
shitty salesmanship

998
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,319
yeah like if it comes in a three-piece

999
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,880
set sell the three-piece set

1000
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,000
so mike will this be uh legalization or

1001
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,840
decriminalization

1002
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,519
if there we get this federal movement

1003
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,240
here totally up in the air still

1004
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,319
okay um all right my guess is if it

1005
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,960
moves forward at all

1006
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:14,079
it will be a half step or a quarter step

1007
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,919
like federal decriminalization

1008
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,000
which honestly wouldn't be that bad if

1009
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,159
the feds just said we're out of it

1010
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,599
i'd really like the feds not to special

1011
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,320
tax it

1012
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,918
yeah they just did a regular tax level

1013
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,480
on it they didn't add anything because

1014
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,880
it was cannabis that'd be great

1015
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,839
colorado went way heavy on the taxes

1016
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,320
yeah

1017
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,918
a lot of places went worse but it keeps

1018
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,759
the black market thriving when you over

1019
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,519
tax it it keeps the free market the free

1020
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,759
market there's no taxes there

1021
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,599
um one of my questions was and i know

1022
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,640
this isn't going to happen like uh

1023
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,240
you don't know what's going to happen

1024
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,960
this is still up in the air but what do

1025
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,359
you think uh

1026
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,759
this will do for legal uh for a medical

1027
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,639
and recreational weed

1028
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,079
huge leaps forward okay will there still

1029
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,519
be two different markets or do you think

1030
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,558
it all just become

1031
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,079
weed it'll be it'll end up evening out

1032
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:07,278
um one of the things i really

1033
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,439
really look forward to is there are a

1034
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,240
bunch of people in my life that are like

1035
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,919
65

1036
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,159
plus and only a few of them were

1037
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,200
cannabis friendly in their youth most of

1038
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,559
them

1039
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,399
it was literally a blockade

1040
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:26,319
to financial stability

1041
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,439
for a lot of them and so they just chose

1042
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,798
to not to

1043
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,558
pretend like it didn't exist from the

1044
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,480
time they were 19 until they were in

1045
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:36,960
their 60s and 70s

1046
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,599
and a doctor brought it up and so

1047
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,759
federal legalization is going to lead to

1048
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,038
clinical trials that lead to them

1049
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,319
getting

1050
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:50,480
far superior medicines um

1051
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:52,960
and that might just mean

1052
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,599
go get a gummy that's five milligrams

1053
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,679
thc

1054
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,719
50 milligram cbd you know what i mean it

1055
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,840
might not be

1056
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,600
go get prozac or whatever the cannabis

1057
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:06,240
drug name ends up being

1058
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:10,398
marinol um is the terrible one now but

1059
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,159
uh that's really exciting and so that

1060
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,918
aspect of the medical market is

1061
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,119
definitely going to stick around

1062
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,199
i don't think it will be half separated

1063
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,159
like it always has been here in colorado

1064
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,239
where

1065
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,519
um you have to get a med card to shop in

1066
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,719
this particular market

1067
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:29,358
i think the production and distribution

1068
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,480
pieces will blend completely together

1069
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,159
all right that's kind of what i prefer

1070
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,280
having them separate here is just

1071
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,800
silly and annoying it's a way to uh

1072
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,480
the excuse was to make sure that the

1073
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,159
patients got their medicine and that the

1074
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,918
rest was available for recreational

1075
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,119
users so they were always taken care of

1076
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,559
but

1077
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,720
it made a lot of sense and we didn't

1078
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,078
we it's not like we're casting a magic

1079
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,598
spell and just

1080
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,000
starting from where we are it's first we

1081
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,599
had

1082
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,838
full prohibition and then we were

1083
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,559
medical with no rules for a long time

1084
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,358
and yeah

1085
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,480
now we're here and we had to respect

1086
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,440
that that process

1087
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,280
happened as it advanced and so keeping

1088
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,480
the two markets separate made a lot of

1089
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,720
sense but

1090
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,519
if it's legal in all 50 states to some

1091
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,199
degree

1092
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,239
having it separated like we do here in

1093
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:19,199
colorado doesn't make a lot of sense

1094
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:21,439
especially when a lot of the rules here

1095
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,598
in colorado get re-examined

1096
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,280
is right now their rules are wildly

1097
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,400
different and that's why there's still a

1098
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,400
medical market at all

1099
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,400
uh yeah way different isn't it weird

1100
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,800
yeah i'm currently without a medical

1101
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,480
cannabis card i just i've been so busy i

1102
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,000
haven't seen it it's just a show

1103
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,440
i can get it i definitely haven't been

1104
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,239
able to get to a doctor's appointment

1105
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,000
like that

1106
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,279
i can get in stores you can't get into

1107
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
just because i've got this little

1108
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,040
it's not even a paper now it's a [ __ ]

1109
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,640
pdf on my phone so yeah

1110
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,079
i've been playing with a lot of edibles

1111
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,400
and i have to eat a

1112
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,240
larger physical quantity of the product

1113
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,599
to get the dosage i need

1114
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,118
then you can medically it's just silly

1115
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,640
yeah that hundred milligram limit at the

1116
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,400
rec stores and eight grams of

1117
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,239
concentrates is the limit so i can get

1118
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,680
four edibles and four grams or eight

1119
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,919
concentrates or

1120
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,039
uh eight edibles but that's all i can i

1121
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,320
know a lot of people are going well dude

1122
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,079
that's a lot of [ __ ] yeah but

1123
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,000
what if i just want to go once a week

1124
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,839
then that's that's my weekly allowance

1125
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,159
and then if anybody comes over and

1126
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,039
you come dab the limits at all i think

1127
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,799
are going away

1128
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:28,079
because the limits aren't there

1129
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,000
for any logical reason once it's

1130
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,680
cannabis is legal in all 50 states and

1131
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,440
available in all 50 states

1132
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,118
right like the limits meant to keeping

1133
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,039
you from buying 100

1134
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,480
of everything and taking them to

1135
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,719
arkansas and selling them

1136
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,639
yeah if there's already stores in

1137
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,199
arkansas that have the same [ __ ] on the

1138
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,799
shelf for roughly the same price that's

1139
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,199
not a job anymore

1140
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,160
and so the rules that make that job

1141
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:55,199
harder

1142
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:56,879
can all go away um i'd like them to keep

1143
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,439
some of the rules because a lot of them

1144
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,039
are good some of them make sense

1145
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,599
if you look at the um

1146
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,279
robbery data at least this was true it's

1147
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,359
probably still true because the reasons

1148
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,880
it was true before made a lot of sense i

1149
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,480
just haven't checked in like the last

1150
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,358
year and a half

1151
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
but cannabis businesses get robbed way

1152
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,838
less than like

1153
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,679
banks gas stations liquor stores

1154
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:25,920
um jc penney's and it's because

1155
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,598
part of legalization was you have to put

1156
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,680
cameras everywhere that have to be

1157
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,800
everywhere there are so many when you

1158
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,279
pull up to the store

1159
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,160
it's like smile you're on high def

1160
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,720
camera

1161
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,399
yeah we've been able to uh yeah you can

1162
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,919
look so if somebody's in the parking lot

1163
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,440
smoking in the dispensary

1164
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,800
parking lot they're smoking a cigarette

1165
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,720
we can zoom in and see if it's a

1166
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,359
cigarette or a joint we're able to look

1167
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,719
very closely from just inside the store

1168
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,000
just by zooming in to see what you're

1169
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,358
smoking out there so be careful

1170
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
don't get yourself or us in trouble

1171
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:56,799
please yep and that's

1172
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,880
like that rule is annoying as a

1173
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,039
prospective business owner because the

1174
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,039
infrastructure for that kind of system

1175
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,279
is pricey

1176
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,320
and it's an added cost to a new business

1177
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,359
but

1178
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,359
from the security standpoint and from uh

1179
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,358
it really helped us push legalization

1180
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,960
forward because colorado and washington

1181
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,159
did [ __ ] like this and he kept the

1182
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,599
robbery numbers down

1183
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,440
yeah that seed to sale and all the

1184
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,640
cameras and there's a security guard an

1185
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,079
armed security guard at most

1186
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,879
dispensaries

1187
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,200
all the pieces matter um i think a lot

1188
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,760
of the necessity for the armed security

1189
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:31,519
guard is going to go away

1190
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,160
part of the reason cannabis costs so

1191
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,719
much is because it's not legal

1192
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,598
everywhere

1193
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,559
yes and the prohibition markup is

1194
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,160
massive

1195
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,920
yep and now that it's not illegal

1196
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,279
there's no reason for it to be expensive

1197
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,760
tomatoes aren't expensive because we

1198
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,040
could just

1199
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,880
have them grow them toss them at people

1200
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,199
and i mean just like everything else

1201
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,358
there's a price that

1202
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,279
all the steak we can produce gets sold

1203
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:57,039
at because it's reasonable and same

1204
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,920
thing with cars and shoes and everything

1205
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,599
else and

1206
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,599
it's the same thing with cannabis it's

1207
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,640
good there's gonna be a price

1208
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,559
fluctuation that's wild for a while and

1209
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:09,039
then it'll settle out

1210
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,239
and that'll be you know the people that

1211
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,079
produce cannabis

1212
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,719
produce this much and the people that

1213
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,200
consume consume this much and

1214
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,559
this is how much money changes hands and

1215
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,239
i think a lot of people are going to be

1216
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,400
happy as [ __ ] with that system

1217
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:23,598
i think a lot about existing i never

1218
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,358
thought we would get here i'm kind of

1219
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,800
blown away that the last couple months

1220
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:28,559
have played out like they have

1221
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,480
it's exciting dude it's been an exciting

1222
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,599
time the past just everything going on

1223
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,480
has been exciting

1224
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,838
do you think we'll see surprises do you

1225
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,719
think we'll see decline in sales in

1226
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:38,078
legal states

1227
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,279
because the other states will have it i

1228
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,839
mean we're not going to sell as much

1229
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,240
because

1230
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,759
uh texas is coming to get it and

1231
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,679
missouri won't be coming to get it

1232
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,040
they're already legal now a lot of them

1233
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:51,039
aren't going to produce it though okay

1234
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,159
um it's sort of like everything else

1235
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,639
there's a place

1236
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,078
that grows oranges and a place that

1237
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,960
grows pineapples and

1238
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,920
places that are known for wine and

1239
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,159
colorado

1240
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:07,039
and oregon washington california

1241
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,960
we've already got a foothold and like

1242
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,719
good luck [ __ ] finding an affording

1243
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,838
grow space in manhattan

1244
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,838
yeah that's very true but for a really

1245
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:19,679
reasonable price i can ship

1246
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:22,480
container loads of cannabis to manhattan

1247
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,000
and i bet my shipping price is lower

1248
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,599
than your grow cost

1249
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,119
all right and i think that's going to be

1250
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,400
true in a lot of places

1251
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,358
um i think a lot of cannabis is headed

1252
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,039
outdoors

1253
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:34,559
and i'm really excited about that

1254
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,239
because one of the downsides to

1255
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,440
legalization

1256
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:42,399
was we finally got to see

1257
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,480
the power consumption and like when

1258
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,519
everybody moved into giant warehouses in

1259
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,480
denver

1260
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,480
they had been very closely monitoring

1261
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,440
their power consumption

1262
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,519
on a couple of green energy initiatives

1263
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,559
and when legalization hit

1264
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,559
and the building boom took place those

1265
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,799
numbers

1266
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:04,559
skyrocketed and it was funny because

1267
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,800
nobody understood what was happening for

1268
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,920
a minute because nobody really believed

1269
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,960
the cannabis was

1270
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,639
market was that big um it's funny the

1271
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,800
dea has been telling people about it

1272
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,799
every year since we were teenagers

1273
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,039
but no one listened or no one really

1274
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,359
understood the numbers

1275
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,920
when you say stuff like 40 billion it's

1276
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,920
so big people can't comprehend it

1277
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,838
and so they just sort of nod along when

1278
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,838
the number gets that big

1279
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,000
but when you really do the math and

1280
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,119
think about it it gets astronomical

1281
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,719
quick

1282
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,200
and it we blew how many transformers in

1283
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,118
colorado blew up the next two years dude

1284
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,318
how many blew up behind a cultivation

1285
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,838
that we managed

1286
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,960
oh excuse me i'm burping that's it i

1287
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:49,119
need a dab burp um

1288
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,559
it was just common for a while colorado

1289
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,160
had to really increase its

1290
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,960
infrastructure

1291
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,519
um and improve our electrical grid

1292
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,639
because

1293
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,079
of all the extra demand and i'm

1294
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,759
kind of excited to see a lot of that

1295
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,318
move outdoors a lot of that moved to

1296
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,560
greenhouses hoop houses

1297
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,480
being around all of that electricity i

1298
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,039
think i can feel it when i walk

1299
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,920
toward the grow buildings that have 100

1300
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,960
250

1301
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,039
500 lights so there's 250

1302
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,679
000 watts of flowering lights in there

1303
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:22,719
plus what [ __ ]

1304
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,559
30 60 90 120 tons of [ __ ] cooling on

1305
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,719
the roof plus all the fans

1306
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,559
uh plus all the moving [ __ ] watering

1307
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,199
pumps and [ __ ] there's a lot you can

1308
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,480
feel

1309
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,838
i like to be able to feel the plant

1310
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,440
energy a little bit when you walk in

1311
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,599
there you don't feel that it all you

1312
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,880
feel transformers and three-phase power

1313
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:42,480
that's all you feel is hum the bigger

1314
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,358
the bigger the grow gets like outside

1315
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,719
cannabis

1316
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:48,159
is a cleaner like it takes bad [ __ ] out

1317
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:52,078
of the air and soil

1318
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:55,519
and gives us back an awesome flower

1319
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,039
but inside it you're you're totally

1320
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,199
killing that

1321
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,639
that benefit yeah but we can it's just

1322
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,719
one of the downsides i also

1323
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:03,759
think indoor herb tends to be a lot

1324
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,759
better it's gonna save

1325
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,240
you five points and crops and there's no

1326
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,520
bird [ __ ] we didn't get hail rain snow

1327
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:13,039
sleet bird [ __ ] yeah we didn't get all

1328
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,599
that random [ __ ] on there but

1329
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,119
uh john made the sun so the sun is uh

1330
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,559
and we're all trying to mimic the sun

1331
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,480
we're just trying to rebuild everything

1332
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:20,799
inside that's already outside you hang a

1333
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,119
light

1334
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,640
that's gonna change where it's grown how

1335
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,280
it's grown

1336
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,559
um like there's major shock waves that

1337
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,720
will go through the industry with

1338
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,199
federal legalization

1339
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,399
um talk for a long time i'm gonna take a

1340
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,399
dab

1341
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,480
this the the shock waves that i'm

1342
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,440
thinking about didn't happen so much in

1343
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,199
canada

1344
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,280
because canada's frozen a lot of the

1345
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,598
year and so they

1346
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,960
their outdoor grocery season is specific

1347
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,760
it's short

1348
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,318
um indoors definitely the way to go here

1349
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,200
in the states that's not true

1350
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:55,759
um and there's a [ __ ] ton of farmland

1351
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,358
that is

1352
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,079
wrongly purposed um not to mention

1353
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,920
cannabis is a very profitable crop

1354
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,359
and so i'm guessing there'll be a lot of

1355
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,200
farmers that

1356
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,358
don't have any business getting into the

1357
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,960
cannabis industry

1358
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,039
just like they were here with business

1359
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,639
owners that bought in without taking the

1360
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:15,199
time to hire people that knew what they

1361
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:17,039
were doing

1362
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,639
oh we saw the hemp industry ruined

1363
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,079
people's lives the past couple of years

1364
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:23,598
doing the same game

1365
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,039
yep um they forget that you have to

1366
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,039
cultivate

1367
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:33,039
a distribution market um for hemp

1368
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:34,880
it's uh we're already wearing all the

1369
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:38,480
hemp shirts we want

1370
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,000
not to be a dick about it but uh

1371
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,240
we need more products for the hemp

1372
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,199
industry but with cannabis that market

1373
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,439
is already

1374
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,879
there the demand is already there and

1375
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,240
the demand is growing

1376
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,880
especially as more medical uses um get

1377
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:54,719
discovered and more people get told hey

1378
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,559
go try this for your ailments and the

1379
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,959
stigma goes away and more people

1380
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,759
are not as afraid and they're ready to

1381
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,280
do it now they're

1382
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,720
finding that as an alternative to the

1383
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,680
other medicines we talked about earlier

1384
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:04,559
they don't have to take the chemo

1385
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,239
medicine their

1386
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:07,519
other medicine the one medicine to make

1387
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,239
some [ __ ] and the other medicine that

1388
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:09,759
makes them

1389
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,358
not [ __ ] the one that makes them pee and

1390
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,960
they're the one that makes them not leak

1391
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:15,039
you maybe stop taking one or three of

1392
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:19,119
those like it cracks me up

1393
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,920
i get like i'm my whole family knows

1394
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,920
that this is

1395
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,400
where i've chosen like this is the hill

1396
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,440
i chose to die on a long time ago

1397
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,519
and for a while like they chuckled and

1398
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,760
then they were just like oh

1399
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,280
like he could have been a banker and

1400
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,200
been written super rich

1401
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,319
right instead he did this and that's

1402
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,879
weird um but he seems happy

1403
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,838
and now like one by one they're shooting

1404
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,280
me messages

1405
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:48,400
like so i've got this thing and then

1406
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,240
my doctor was like try some medical

1407
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,800
cannabis and i don't know what he meant

1408
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,519
by that he said sav what's a sav like

1409
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,200
are

1410
00:45:53,519 --> 00:46:00,639
is it is it a strain or strand is what

1411
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,159
you just say um but

1412
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:03,920
i chuckled because it's happened to a

1413
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,679
half dozen of them now

1414
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:10,240
and that market is exploding

1415
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:13,039
if you look at the marijuana use went

1416
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:16,159
way up in colorado type articles

1417
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:19,358
when you get into the numbers it's

1418
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,598
the over 55 crowd that just retired from

1419
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:24,000
a job that's randomly drug test or

1420
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,880
threatened to for 30 years

1421
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,719
and then their doctor said oh yeah that

1422
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,960
that ailment sounds miserable

1423
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,039
why don't you go smoke weed about it and

1424
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,039
the symptoms will go away

1425
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,239
and they tried it and now they're in

1426
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,239
love with it

1427
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:39,759
that's where the big increases are and

1428
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:43,279
so when

1429
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:47,119
that gets combined with

1430
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,200
outdoor growing and all 50 states coming

1431
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,720
online the last of them coming online

1432
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,078
kind of at the same time

1433
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:53,838
like those shock waves are going to

1434
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,920
ripple for a while y'all

1435
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,000
oh i love the uh i love the little old

1436
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,358
lady that just discovered cannabis

1437
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,119
she's like a cute old lady and she's

1438
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,960
like my doctor showed me how to smoke

1439
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,559
weed or told me to smoke weed

1440
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,760
and so i bought some and like when i was

1441
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,000
a bud tender and worked at the

1442
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,560
dispensary those are my favorites

1443
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,079
they're so enthusiastic about cannabis

1444
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,279
and they're like kind of secretive about

1445
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,318
it because they don't want their nephews

1446
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,680
and uncles to know

1447
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:17,519
but their [ __ ] nephews and uncles

1448
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,960
shop at the same dispensary that they do

1449
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:20,559
and they're all trying to like make sure

1450
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,159
nobody knows and [ __ ]

1451
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,359
it was just i loved those little old

1452
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:24,000
ladies that were so enthusiastic and i

1453
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:25,920
feel so much

1454
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,760
better and i eat the edibles and i rub

1455
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,480
it on my elbows and i give some to my

1456
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,920
dog

1457
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,440
i used to love those little old ladies

1458
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,559
bro they were really one of my favorite

1459
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,960
customers

1460
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,240
i i always loved showing them around the

1461
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,679
sales floor and like

1462
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:38,959
oh you don't want to smoke it you can

1463
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:40,399
eat it you don't want to eat it you can

1464
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,838
rub it into your shoulder

1465
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,680
yep um yeah we have it in an ice cream

1466
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:46,799
like it was just fun to kind of take him

1467
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,199
around

1468
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,640
but i always my mind always goes back to

1469
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:56,480
there was a documentary or

1470
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:59,279
um i think it was a documentary where

1471
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,559
they followed around it might have been

1472
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,319
one of the sanjay gupta specials

1473
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,000
a couple of patients that were trying

1474
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,639
out medical cannabis for the first

1475
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,480
time and one of them was like this 50s

1476
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:13,519
or 60s

1477
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,599
veteran i think navy vet and

1478
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,559
he went to the dispensary and bought

1479
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,039
like an eighth

1480
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,280
and bought up a glass pipe i know where

1481
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:24,639
you're going and went home

1482
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:28,559
and sat down on the couch and like just

1483
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:30,558
ripped a chunk off the top of the bud

1484
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,480
and stuffed it in the pipe and then

1485
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,880
tried to light it from underneath and

1486
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,599
like

1487
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,000
to cook it from underneath and kept

1488
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,079
burning his hand

1489
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,760
for three or four times and the whole

1490
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,280
time i'm watching this i'm [ __ ]

1491
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,079
horrified because

1492
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,599
there's no way in hell that if that guy

1493
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,480
hasn't been around cannabis

1494
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,359
that much for real that the cameraman

1495
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,358
statistically

1496
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,358
if that guy was that clueless there's no

1497
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,119
way the cameraman was

1498
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,799
also that clueless it's just not

1499
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,079
statistically possible you know the

1500
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,920
camera dude's not supposed to get

1501
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,480
involved and that dude was uh that's how

1502
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,159
you smoke

1503
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,079
other drugs bro the way that guy was

1504
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:11,279
lighting that so he's been wrong

1505
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:13,760
before yeah um was kind of my guess

1506
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,680
but if you've been around something that

1507
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,440
you consumed that way

1508
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:18,799
how the [ __ ] do you not know how to hit

1509
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,880
a bowl of weed

1510
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,480
right like how is that possible i've

1511
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,680
seen that documentary and i laughed at

1512
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,880
that too and i was like that guy does

1513
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,919
other drugs that's what i do

1514
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,200
like his fourth hit he gets it right um

1515
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,880
and my guess was

1516
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,719
that they showed the lighting of the

1517
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,000
pipe from underneath and a couple of

1518
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:38,879
anti-drug images um

1519
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,079
but uh oh yeah yeah when older people

1520
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,039
would come in

1521
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:46,160
i would always sort of like so what's

1522
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:48,000
your familiarity level with the plant

1523
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,358
like please tell me so that i know who

1524
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,519
i'm dealing with that i can

1525
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:54,799
appropriately educate you so that you

1526
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:58,000
don't hurt yourself or someone else

1527
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,000
like don't burn your hand or

1528
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,599
eat two chocolate bars and get behind

1529
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,358
the wheel

1530
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,039
yeah or try to just do anything after

1531
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,078
two of those chocolate bars

1532
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:07,119
all right mike i do need to start

1533
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,559
wrapping up the show here we've been

1534
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,119
going for close to an hour but i've got

1535
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,200
one more

1536
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,559
question on my list of uh federal

1537
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,799
legalization

1538
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,040
topics here write your senators you guys

1539
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,000
yes please do write your senators uh

1540
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:19,519
right easy to find

1541
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,960
write them again write them once a month

1542
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,239
maybe once every two weeks and let them

1543
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,720
know that you do support

1544
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,558
the federal legalization of cannabis

1545
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,000
let's do it uh be professional don't

1546
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,839
curse don't use profanity

1547
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
just kindly just politely let them know

1548
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:32,719
hey my name is rasta jeff and i think

1549
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,920
that we

1550
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:39,279
are going to be like foreign

1551
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,960
but mike my question for you is um

1552
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,559
if we do have federal legalization of

1553
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,720
cannabis does that mean

1554
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,200
bro that we get to have cannabis events

1555
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,719
again like if it's legal like beer does

1556
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:49,118
that mean since we've got beer at the

1557
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,159
fair

1558
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,680
and there's bars on every corner oh man

1559
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,358
come on i just want you to tell me yes

1560
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,960
that one of these days we can go

1561
00:50:55,358 --> 00:51:02,799
on absolutely bad friends again

1562
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:06,000
hopes and dreams yeah um colorado before

1563
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:09,760
the pandemic was in the process

1564
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,960
of discussion they're discussing rules

1565
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,160
and regulations for

1566
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,280
consumption clubs and had just

1567
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:18,078
started issuing licenses and then

1568
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,880
everybody

1569
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,920
just hit a big red stop on all of that

1570
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,559
because

1571
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,440
it doesn't make sense to put to be

1572
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,000
licensing

1573
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,800
businesses where you can go consume

1574
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,119
cannabis

1575
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,240
with your friends if you can't go to

1576
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,880
businesses or

1577
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:39,199
be with your friends yeah um

1578
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,200
they hit pause but it made sense like

1579
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:44,159
there's other [ __ ] on their plate

1580
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,679
and the way small businesses are right

1581
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,399
now like can you imagine

1582
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:51,440
just paying rent oh hell no until this

1583
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,680
is over um for a business that hasn't

1584
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,079
even had a chance to open yet

1585
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,759
and won't until this is totally over

1586
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,880
yeah it would be closed by now

1587
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,800
yeah bankrupt yep

1588
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,480
and apparently landlords still really

1589
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,960
want their money for retail space which

1590
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,760
is why everybody's closing so

1591
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,318
um but i i'm desperate for it i'm i want

1592
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,520
cannabis cups i want cushcons i want

1593
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:17,920
indo expos

1594
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:18,960
i want cannabis sections at county fairs

1595
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,240
yeah

1596
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,559
um i want i mean

1597
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,358
everything's short of sign spinners i

1598
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,440
want it all

1599
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:29,119
yeah uh just like we have a ball there's

1600
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,639
no reason we couldn't have it

1601
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,318
just like we have a bar where we can go

1602
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:33,759
see some shitty classic rock band on the

1603
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,279
weekend right across the street and go

1604
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,040
listen to somebody play [ __ ] mustang

1605
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,720
sally and born to be wild

1606
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,719
and drink [ __ ] liquor until we get

1607
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,318
[ __ ] until we [ __ ] puke

1608
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:43,759
why can't we go somewhere right across

1609
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:45,519
the street and sit at a booth and

1610
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,359
[ __ ] take a few dabs and listen to

1611
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:48,880
some bob marley and some fish

1612
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:51,759
like i think we should all be able to

1613
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,440
have a good time does it have to be fish

1614
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,359
well i'll let you play some 311 on the

1615
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,800
jukebox too bro

1616
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:02,078
it's uh just give me a cannabis

1617
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,640
friendly space outside um

1618
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,318
give me put up a roof deck that's what

1619
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,078
they kept talking about in denver

1620
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:09,358
because apparently i don't know if i

1621
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,760
don't know if the listeners are aware

1622
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:14,639
but if you see somebody smoking a joint

1623
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,200
i guess it makes you high too i don't

1624
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,039
know

1625
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,118
but they seem really worried that it'd

1626
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:20,318
be really good i would see people

1627
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,920
smoking weed

1628
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:23,838
so they were talking about doing

1629
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,800
consumption at venues

1630
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:28,960
open air on roof decks they kept saying

1631
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,640
roof decks

1632
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,318
which seems sort of nuts to me like do

1633
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:32,960
you really want stoned people three

1634
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:36,079
floors up

1635
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,440
fenced in like maybe things [ __ ] through

1636
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,440
and just let us be in the parking lot

1637
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,280
for a minute i don't know

1638
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:45,119
but but uh hopefully some of that

1639
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,960
the nonsense goes away with federal

1640
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,720
legislation that's my big hope

1641
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,559
especially in places like colorado like

1642
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,318
if i was in arkansas i would just be

1643
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,559
tits up happy that

1644
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,000
this was happening at all yeah because

1645
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,599
otherwise it probably wasn't going to

1646
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,280
happen in your neck of the woods for a

1647
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,240
long time

1648
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,960
um but if everybody else gets to why not

1649
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,639
us too

1650
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,159
this is going to be this yeah that's it

1651
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,519
and even the very last state to legalize

1652
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,000
get it right down the street why can't

1653
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,759
we get it here i agree with it

1654
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,440
had i prepared for this show more i

1655
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,359
would have a list of all the places that

1656
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,880
are talking about legalization in one

1657
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,440
form or another but it's a

1658
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,358
long list right now pretty much

1659
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,800
everybody that's not in on it

1660
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:29,440
yet is talking about it in a major way

1661
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,800
the last two elections were shake-ups

1662
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:36,880
and they shook up towards legalization

1663
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,559
excellent keep shaking keep shaking it

1664
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,480
i'm excited dude i hope we'll get

1665
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,000
federal legalization that would help uh

1666
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,280
a lot of things for a lot of people and

1667
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,079
it'd make things a lot more fun than

1668
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,160
when the

1669
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,960
the vid is it's gonna be really funny

1670

1673
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:55,519

1674
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,480
he does

1675
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:59,519
i hope he has to sign it real soon yeah

1676
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,960
