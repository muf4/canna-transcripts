comedian make me laugh it happens pretty

200
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:42,199
regularly it's silly cuz I still

201
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,240
consider myself an open micer comedian

202
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:49,319
comedian is something I aspire to be but

203
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,519
um I I I I don't like it oh you're a

204
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,598
comedian not really I mean I'm not

205
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,318
getting paid for this I'm still a steel

206
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,159
worker I I'll consider myself a comedian

207
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
or like consider the years I've been a

208
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,720
comedian as like as many times is like

209
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,159
claiming on my taxes and [ __ ] like that

210
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,599
nice okay that's fair enough respect

211
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,120
when when you actually start getting

212
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,199
like booked for gigs and stuff like that

213
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,879
like we're just local feature guys like

214
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,160
open you got a lot of heart dude and

215
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,720
that's what takes a lot of a lot of get

216
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,400
a lot of it is a lot of heart and that's

217
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,360
what you need a lot of guys are they

218
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,598
just don't have the heart they want to

219
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,720
go up there and repeat the same [ __ ]

220
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,519
every week and you can tell they're just

221
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
doing it to just do it you guys got the

222
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,318
heart you're putting work I do it

223
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,519
because it it's a way for me to get all

224
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,759
the negative [ __ ] I'm feeling about

225
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,079
myself out and if I can make people

226
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,720
laugh from it then it kind of validates

227
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,598
all the shitty things that I've ever

228
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,039
done well Paul that's kind of a

229
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:41,439
self-righteous way to look at it I'm

230
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,279
kind of about it it's very personal I'm

231
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,959
not doing it for anybody else the way

232
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,359
the way Paul does his comedy self

233
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,120
deprecatingly yeah so like it yeah it

234
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,199
might sound like oh this is he's doing

235
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,918
it for himself and it is but it's also

236
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,680
like I need to tell you this it's well

237
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:58,120
it's a healthy way to get [ __ ] out it's

238
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,598
way cheaper than a therapist and if

239
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,240
you're making me laugh we're both get

240
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,240
therapy out of it so that's pretty cool

241
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,918
and and if and and a lot of the guys

242
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,918
will you know we're all we're always

243
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,158
trying new stuff there's only a few guys

244
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,439
that you know kind of have fallen into a

245
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:16,598
trap of not doing new stuff fairly

246
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:18,839
regularly but um it's it's fun to see

247
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:21,038
like when a joke can fail too and you

248
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,799
can see what he wanted to do with it and

249
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,279
it's like damn dude like if you'd have

250
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,478
Twisted this that joke would have worked

251
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,638
it's neat seeing that stuff so you get

252
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,439
to see like the initial and like why

253
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,680
didn't that work and then you talk about

254
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,958
it and oh okay and you get to see it the

255
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,439
next time he does it and he's got a

256
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,918
little bit more confidence cuz he's done

257
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,760
it once like open mic comedy is so fun

258
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,600
to watch as an art form not just the

259
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,600
comedy that you're watching but the

260
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,759
comedy is like the reason you're putting

261
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,959
butts in seats yeah but for us to watch

262
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,559
guys evolve and get better and like um

263
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,599
perfect case in point was Dan Rainey

264
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:01,879
absolutely about Dany better he was he

265
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,159
was really not good when he started and

266
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:08,000
but he went from not good and he was

267
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:11,399
okay but he just now he's good and it

268
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,519
came fast it went a lot easier for him

269
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,320
to go from not good to like good I think

270
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,000
confidence had a lot to do with that his

271
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,399
his material I thought was always funny

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,879
it's just when he told it he was kind of

273
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,320
unsure about it and you can't really be

274
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,600
took a lot to get him started didn't it

275
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,278
just to get him up the first just to get

276
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,600
him on stage like he'd been coming to

277
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,240
comedy shows since like six months I

278
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,040
first started doing comedy and he was

279
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,278
just so scared to get up on stage and

280
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,799
tell a joke and then he finally did it

281
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,200
and for some people once you do it that

282
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,679
just opens up the floodgates you can't

283
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,720
stop doing it well I'll admit it uh as I

284
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,919
was a teenager I've watched comedy you

285
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,240
can tell from talking to me and I've

286
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,799
been into comedy as long as you guys

287
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,480
have I'm not but I've been in that club

288
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,159
and I would love to walk up on stage and

289
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,079
throw down one good set and I've got a

290
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,600
podcast I'm obviously okay was talking

291
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,599
in a group we do grow meetings where I

292
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,560
just run my mouth and talk about growing

293
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,879
dude I get I just thinking about going

294
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:04,278
up there to do a set no thank you I want

295
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,278
to [ __ ] my pants it it scares the [ __ ]

296
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,200
out of me that's the other part of it

297
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:09,679
like I know I can't I I can't say I

298
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,640
can't do it but I know that that's not

299
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,199
my wheelhouse yeah it's just weird for

300
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,600
me to even think about getting up there

301
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
but at the party or whatever I'll I'll

302
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,040
tell everybody a joke all day long

303
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,200
that's the other part of it when you get

304
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,319
up there and you really feel like you

305
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,519
have something to say and you want to

306
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,720
tell these people something and they

307
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,240
don't laugh at all it's so heartbreaking

308
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,959
yeah yeah but that's soul crushing but

309
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,519
that's that's the thing that I like

310
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,199
watching in other guys and in myself is

311
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,039
you watch these guys like I was trying

312
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,639
to get to with Dan is like he evolved

313
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,519
and you could see that Evolution every

314
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,360
step and it was neat and I think that um

315
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,039
you know there's guys that don't want to

316
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,839
come out to shows oh they tell the same

317
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,199
jokes or something like that but it's

318
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,079
like no like look at the new thing that

319
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
he did to the end I don't know like I

320
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,199
know that we're probably getting pretty

321
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,760
deep on like oh no it's like writing

322
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,079
it's like tailoring that that joke it's

323
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,439
I I understand what you're saying and it

324
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,078
does it's not something it's like making

325
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
a recipe perfect the first time you make

326
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:02,278
that recipe it was too spicy but you

327
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,399
knew what you're aiming for took out a

328
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,838
little spice added more garlic it's like

329
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,159
watching and I've seen you do it I've

330
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,720
watched your joke telling evolve not

331
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,120
just your jokes get better but your

332
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,480
approach to telling a joke you don't

333
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,039
have to get naked to have a punchline

334
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,639
anymore because your jokes have some

335
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,319
body to them keep your clothes on that

336
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,200
was a long time ago dud that was one of

337
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,760
the best bits I've ever seen hey thanks

338
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,040
buddy yeah that was amazing Jesus I'm

339
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,319
going to do that joke for everybody

340
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,039
right

341
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,120
now it it can't see it I get it cuz it's

342
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:32,838
a visual bit and

343
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,278
and that's how that's going to fail as a

344
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,120
joke in your I'm looking for Dan's

345
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,159
Twitter feed so that we can get Dan Dan

346
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,879
Champion there you go look for Dan

347
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,000
Champion just follow him randomly he'll

348
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,360
have no idea why he got a bmb's really

349
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,078
he's a really funny guy coming out of

350
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,278
Springs there's a few funny funny people

351
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:50,559
coming out of the Springs but I think

352
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:52,000
he's one of the funnier ones definitely

353
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,078
and he's really working on it and it's

354
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,919
neat to see that so it's it's definitely

355
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:58,399
uh it's it's like having a second job

356
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,958
when you're not getting paid for it

357
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,679

359
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,879
musician and I've gone and played free

360
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:06,319
shows and just that I know that feeling

361
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,278
of just locking in with the bass player

362
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,560
and getting the song right that that was

363
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,958
worth my setup time my couple hours on

364
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,479
stage yeah oh for sure to drive to

365

368
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,480

369
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,399

373
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,159
I don't use a lot of old stuff are you

374
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,480
exploiting your jail experience for

375
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,838
material I have okay I would definitely

376
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
have some material a jail material and a

377
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,079
recent breakup you should write a joke

378
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,919
about did not get raped and I'm offended

379
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,799
well I did get raped first of all and my

380
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,319
my comedy is very personal like I have

381
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,319
to be 100% honest with my writing and my

382
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,800
comedy cuz I feel like that's the only

383
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,240
way that I can really find my own voice

384
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,599
cuz I'm still looking for it I don't

385

really know what I'm exactly doing it I

386
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,480

confused if you did or did not get raped

388
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,480

the air exactly all right I want to read

468
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,799
a news article because Clint actually

469
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,599
told me that he had a question for me

470
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,278
and I'm going to my text message to try

471
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,278
to remember what that question was

472
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,958
because Jamaica yes yes um and I also

473
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,838
about using cannabis as a Sacrament we

474
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,318
talked a little bit about Jamaica uh

475
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,600
legalizing cannabis for medical use on a

476
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,879
past episode it was either the last one

477
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,639
or the one before um and they also have

478
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,078
made it it used to be if you recau with

479
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,919
any cannabis in Jamaica it would be a

480
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:26,078
7-Day uh sentence in a jamaic in jail

481
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,078
and it's nothing like the little luxury

482
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,318
condo that you just spent some time in

483
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,559
it would be uh the PUO County Jail no

484
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:35,719
but I've heard some good stories it's

485
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,318
the everyone in there trades stories of

486
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,680
like where to get arrested it's like you

487
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,879
got to go to Crowley County they have

488
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,758
carpet it's awesome but like apparently

489
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,639
Pablo County Jail is the worst facility

490
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,839
in the state wow well I would believe

491
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,600
that yeah well then the Jamaican jail is

492
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,160
it's still going to be worse yeah of

493
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,519
course but uh so and now in Jamaica if

494
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,879
you get caught with Canabis it's just a

495
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,399
fine you don't go to jail right away

496
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,519
it's like a $200 fine if you have less

497
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,639
than an ounce so now guys like us can go

498
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,480
and also they've made it to where if you

499
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,798
have a medical marijuana card in the

500
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,599
States you can go there and register

501
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,918
your medical marijuana card for a small

502
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,918
fee and get a pass to buy medical

503
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,160
marijuana while you were in Jamaica from

504
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,319
their stores yeah awesome I heard their

505
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,319
weed sucks though it's not going to now

506
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:19,399
because a lot of people from the United

507
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:20,959
States saw this coming that cannabis was

508
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,199
going to be legalized and I have friends

509
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,919
in the industry that have already flown

510
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,279
down there and set up shops and testing

511
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,280
labs and BC bubble man was down there

512
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,599
teaching everybody how to make good hash

513
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:33,599
so uh it's going on down there yeah so

514
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,119
that that's kind of kind of what I can

515
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,480
tell you about Jamaica without talking

516
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,199
too much about what we said on another

517
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,319
episode but then you asked me ironically

518
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,080
you said how about using uh cannabis as

519
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:46,159
a Sacrament and then today I look at the

520
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,720
Cannabis and there it's the news page I

521
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,960
check out the Cannabis their headline is

522
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,679
new in Indiana a cannabis Church gets

523
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,279
its chance yeah I think that's where I

524
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:59,120
got that idea for that question from Ni

525
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:01,319
was because Indiana passed that law that

526
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:05,558
allows people to discriminate against

527
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:08,439
gays like uh now like as a part of

528
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:10,079
religion is it okay to smoke weed there

529
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,880
and it has to be because they can't tell

530
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,798
you what to do by that law I didn't read

531
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,600
if you're going to uphold one you got to

532
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:16,158
uphold the other well I'll read the

533
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,798
whole article here uh the sub headline

534
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,600
says if someone is smoking in our church

535
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:21,720
God bless them Church founder Bill Levan

536
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,959
says this is a church to show a proper

537
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,720
way of life a loving way of life we are

538
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,558
all called

539
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,480
canarians I don't know how I feel about

540
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:34,038
the word canarians but we reok and drink

541
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,720
the punch really iard something cannabis

542
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,079
related to add to that we'll hear it

543
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,079
before we get into the article the uh a

544
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,720
lot of Jews smoke pot they smoke weed

545
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,759
and uh a lot of them especially now with

546
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,200
like the younger like more alternative

547
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,879
hidic groups that are coming up like in

548
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,080
New York like the nanox and everything

549
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,000
like that they uh they use it as a sort

550
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,240
of way to go back to their cultural

551
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,038
Roots the holy anointing oil had um a

552
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,759
cannaboss some in it which is cannabis

553
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:04,400
uhhuh and it had so much in it that it

554
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,798
would have psychoactive effects in it

555
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,600
and in other cases they think that when

556
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:12,798
the high priest would go into a tent to

557
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,359
speak to God they would use um things

558
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,440
like cannaboss some different other

559
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,599
herbs and stuff and incense and olive

560
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,320
oil and uh the THC oil and everything

561
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,839
and they would just basically HotBox

562
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,639
themselves as a way to speak to God and

563
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,359
oh uh Paul's Jewish by the way yeah very

564
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,919
there's a there's a book there's a book

565

Rastafarians use cannabis uh if and

572

from part of the world where cannabis

574
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,440

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,799
and turned as wi as John Bueno would dab

644
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,679
no I think it was Luke CWI wasn't oh no

645
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:15,038
prevan it was prev there's been so many

646
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,559
people at this table that we've dabbed

647
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:21,359
out that have just yeah sorry dabs I

648
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:24,678
don't know how I feel about

649
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,558
dabs dabs dabs do Jeff Jabs look like

650
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,960
drugs oh it does I'm sure when you break

651
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,480
out a blowtorch and you start heating

652
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,038
that [ __ ] up I'm sure it does it looks

653
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,480
like drugs yeah guys when you're dabbing

654
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,558
someone just just remember that that

655
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,480
you're using a torch and it looks like

656
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:37,399
we're heating up some crack it seriously

657
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,480
does so like if people are discriminated

658
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,919
against you for doing dabs I am too

659
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,919
because because it looks like drugs you

660
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,520
guys are ruining weed it's too much it's

661
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,080
too much for me like I know like it's

662
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:53,759
supposedly cleaner right than smoking

663
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:54,839
the actual Lea yeah there's less crap

664
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,558
that you're smoking you're smoking the

665
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,759
more like pure form of it and all but

666
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,839
and butane it just [ __ ] me up so much

667
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,519
well don't they do like a different

668
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,839
method now yeah there's no butane yeah

669
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,079
the method you're probably talking about

670
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,000
is rosin where we're just using a a

671
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,678
pressing comb like a straightening iron

672
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,079
squeezing the juice out of the bud by

673
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,519
that way but with the BHO the butane

674
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,038
there's no butane left in our product

675
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,240
we're uh we're getting it clean we

676
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,200
figured out how to clean it out real

677
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,759
well that's good you are yeah I I smoke

678
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,679
cigarettes so I don't really care about

679
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,319
butane or anything like that I'm putting

680
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,679
horrible things into my body yummy and

681
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,960
uh that's a shout out to cigarettes I

682
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,919
don't know if you guys ever smoked those

683
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,400
before but give them a try they're fun

684
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,240
we had to talk about that on a previous

685
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,840
episode uh there were three guys in the

686
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,159
room I took like a half gr dab and

687
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,798
didn't choke and the other two guys are

688
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,360
cigarette smokers and they took little

689
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,798
tiny dabs and had to get up and leave so

690
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,798
they could go hwk lugies and die for a

691
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:43,319
minute so if you want to take fat dabs

692
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:44,639
if you want to do big hikes if you want

693
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,319
to go high in elevation if you want to

694
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,120
live long don't smoke cig if you want to

695
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,038

the least amount I've weighed in my

712
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,720
whole life so I feel like Paul uh has a

713
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:30,079
few things he needs to get off his chest

714
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,200
he keeps going back to a specific top no

715
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,278

723
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,960
really you know up to you and he's kind

724
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,839
of Thug now cuz he spent some time in

725
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,558
the SL a little Thug I met I have made a

726
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,879
lot of friends in there who want me to

727
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:57,319
do nefarious things for them I'm sure oh

728
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,640
yeah because they can't wait to get out

729
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:01,639
and get back into yeah exactly his

730
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,278
eyebrows say Thug

731
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,440
Life tatto he's got a 13 tattooed on the

732
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,159
inside of his lip looks good with your

733
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,519
teardrop tattoo I uh I heard a lot of

734
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,039
[ __ ] up stories from Mexican cartel

735
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,879
guys like this one kid that I was in

736
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,000
there with he's not a kid he's like 25

737
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,200
but uh he apparently [ __ ] two chickens

738
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,038
to death when he was like 13 in Mexico

739
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,399
all right I'm going to keep reading this

740
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:25,000
article from it says marijuana is

741
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,678
currently illegal in Indiana for both

742
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,319
medical and recreational use so the

743
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,720
church could test the application of the

744
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,480
the new law rfra prevents Indiana's

745
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,079
government sub from substantially

746
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,120
burgeoning a person's ex exercise of

747
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,879
religion if it can demonstrate that it

748
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,918
is at least the res at let me try that

749
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,440
again because I'm still [ __ ] up from

750
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,880
what Paul just said if it can

751
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,679
demonstrate that it is the least

752
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
restrictive means of furthering a

753
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,880
compelling governmental interest just

754
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,840
the best segue I've ever heard when when

755
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,720
we asked him why he did it he just said

756
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,439
uh cuz it's

757
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,919
Mexico so Mexico you have some explain

758
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,360
to

759
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,080
do did he behead the chickens when he

760
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:06,839
was done know if they ate him or what he

761
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:09,119
was like that egg came out of that hole

762
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,119
that egg is about that look what I could

763
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,678
do it seems like a waste of chicken he

764
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,678
was all hungry when he was done did he

765
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,038
eat it afterwards that's what we asked

766
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:20,278
but he said no that was gross that's

767
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:23,398
what's gross about that story

768
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:25,679
yeah is a interesting

769
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:27,398
character all right so L who spoke to

770
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,960
the post by phone said the church yeah

771
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:32,239
this is from Indiana this part Paul's

772
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,798
part is from Mexico uh Lan who spoke to

773
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,319
the post by phone said the church has

774
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:37,720
received $2,000 in donations and

775
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:40,038
received more than $7,000 or 7,000

776
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,798
Facebook fans in the 5 days that it has

777
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:43,839
existed he hopes to build the first

778
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:45,679
church or temple built of hemp creete a

779
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,038
building material similar to Concrete

780
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,480
that includes hemp that's cool going all

781
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:51,440
I've heard a lot about hemp creete and I

782
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,440
think it's amazing I that we need to

783
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,240
start using this more yeah Industrial

784
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,720
Hemp is a good idea especially since we

785
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,880
can now grow hemp in the United States

786
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,720
what are they doing just taking rocks

787
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,440
out creating putting hemp in instead of

788
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,440
concrete you know I don't know how they

789
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,759
make concrete so I don't want to sound

790
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,320
stupid and try to act like that's

791
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,679
exactly how they do it I don't know I

792
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,918
don't know either I'm sure they're using

793
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,679
some kind of canile as like the the

794
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,360
powdery agent yeah yeah I it's it's

795
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:19,320
apparently like extremely fire resistant

796
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,759
like so your houses won't burn down and

797
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,278
things and if it does it'll smell real

798
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,119
good smell really good I like I like how

799
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,000
we're two capable white men and we don't

800
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,879
know how to make concrete like we should

801
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,519
know you should know you're steel worker

842
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,480
counseling for heroin service and we

843
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,240
have a huge epidemic in this country

844
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,798
we'll probably have Alcoholics Anonymous

845
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,359
too I'm not going to allow alcohol on

846

for Better Living sorry I'm laughing at

850
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
this article and you guys well I'm

851
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,440
trying to read uh the Bibles of other

852
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,440
religious religions are yester year

853
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,120
about the drinking out of goat skins

854
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,480
what about drinking out of goat skins

855
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,119
that doesn't relate to the people with

856
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,798
GPS in their hand and 7,000 Tunes in

857
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,599
that same hand he said the church is

858
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,398
very simple the first good book we're

859
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:38,119
going to ask partitioners to read and

860
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,199
understand is the Emperor wears no

861
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:42,558
clothes so it kind of feels to me like

862
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,319
this guy's copying that church on Weeds

863
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,480
remember that church on Weeds oh I

864
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,720
didn't watch weeds watch TV show yeah

865
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,519
weed I didn't watch it's a good TV show

866
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,319
remember that up until Nancy got shot

867
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,000
and then I I was like spoiler alert yeah

868
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,558
dude if you haven't [ __ ] watched that

869
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,640
by now I'm going to spoil the whole

870
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,158
the last episode of weeds definitely

871
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,519
made me tear up though that was a really

872
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,039
good season finale or series finale

873
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,200
remember I don't remember that part

874
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,519
that's really good all right more

875
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,159
article he says I'm very faith-driven

876
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,120
I'm very spiritual and I'm filled with

877
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,840
love he said I find that most religions

878
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,398
are misled into gross perversions of

879
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,158
what they are meant to be this path has

880
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:18,759
led me to lead a religion that people in

881
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,640
today's world can relate to we don't

882
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,839
have any guilt Doctrine built in we

883
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,799
don't have any sins built in once the

884
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,439
church is is established members will be

885
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:29,639
asked for individual donations of $4.20

886
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,480
a month he said said Indiana attorney

887
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,399
and political commentator Abdul Hakim

888
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,399
shabbaz wrote that Indiana legislators

889
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,959
may have put the state in a position to

890
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,678
acknowledge those who profess to smoke

891
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,798
pot as a religious Sacrament you see if

892
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,320
I would argue that under RFA as long as

893
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,079
you can show that Reaper is part of your

894
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,839
religious practices you got a pretty

895
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,639
good shot of getting off scott free he

896
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:52,038
wrote remember under rfra the state has

897
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,240
to articulate a compelling interest and

898
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:57,038
preventing you from smoking pot I argue

899
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,679
they can't the Church of cannabis is

900
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,720
just one test in many under indiia

901
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,679
Indiana's new law which has escalated a

902
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,319
national prominence in the past week

903
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,120
raising questions about the future of

904
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:10,398
religious freedom laws and gay rights so

905
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,079
I should recap a little bit the reason

906
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:15,599
that this is popping up is because in

907
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:17,960
Indiana uh they just tried to uh do some

908
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,798
rude [ __ ] to gay people citing the Bible

909
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,840
as their reasoning and then these people

910
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,158
said well if you're going to cite the

911
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,119
Bible for saying the Bible

912
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,080
says I don't even want to get into the

913
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:30,119
Bible some folks interpretation of of

914
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,798
the Bible says that homosexuality is

915
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:32,798
wrong I'm not going to say if I agree or

916
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:34,240
disagree I'm going to say that that's

917
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,918
what that one book says in what people

918
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,599
have read so since that is a thing we're

919
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,720
also saying that in that same book

920
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:41,918
they've said that all these herbs are

921
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,000
here for us to smoke we're playing by

922
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,440
these rules on the gay thing we're

923
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,919
playing by these rules on the pot thing

924
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,360
haha we win that's kind of what this

925
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,000
church is trying to do sick yeah so I

926
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:53,558
think that's kind of cool with two cues

927
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,240
sick gnarly bro smoke some weed in

928
00:31:53,558 --> 00:32:00,599
church I want to see a letterman top 10

929
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,839
of his uh of like his uh dos and don'ts

930
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,158
like number one Thou shalt not spill the

931
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:08,879
bong water Thou shalt not okay I hate

932
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,200
when people use the Old Testament as

933
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,200
their sort of you know guide to hating

934
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,679
on gays and hating on anything because

935
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,880
that's where all the anti-gay stuff

936
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,200
comes from it doesn't come from the New

937
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,399
Testament yeah well it's all about the

938
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,319
cleanliness and and the reason why um a

939
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:26,959
lot of uh people think that the they

940
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,398
they put the the anti-gay thing in the

941
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,000
Old Testament was your living in a

942
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,879
desert you're living around people who

943
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,919
are all trying to kill you so every baby

944
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,559
counts at that point the Old Testament

945
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,278
is just a guide in how to survive in the

946
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:38,638
desert and some religions say that

947
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:40,558
you're not supposed to jerk off because

948
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:43,000
you don't want to waste sperm like that

949
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,720
could have been re uh carrying on our

950
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,038
religion and our race precious it's it's

951
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,360
continuing on our people so we can

952
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,398
continue to exist I'm a [ __ ] sinner

953
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,000
you're not going to get that chicken

954
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:52,558
pregnant and keep our religion going

955
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,200
we're not we're not living we're not

956
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,519
living in a desert around Pake P we're

957
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,240
not living in a desert around a bunch of

958
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,798
hosle barbarians who are trying to kill

959
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,319
us we kind of are in some ways yes I

960
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,000
guess we kind of are just in a little

961
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,359
bit different sense than back in the day

962
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,720
yeah well the world's grossly

963
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,558

like a hangout thing to do I don't even

987
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,038
religious or a spiritual person

988
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,240
otherwise no okay no do you think it's

989
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,039
kind of a way do you think it's kind of

990
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,760
a way for people to just smoke pot and

991
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:14,800
kind of abuse it in that sense

992
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,480
absolutely I think uh there are a lot of

993
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,200
people I do it I do it uh my first dab

994
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,918
is medical that first dab makes my

995
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,638
shoulders not hurt dude I knocked myself

996
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,078
clean the [ __ ] out a few days ago like

997
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,720
clean out and a the first dab makes that

998
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,800
not hurt uh second dab dab makes me good

999
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,759
and high third dab and I'm just dabbed

1000
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,240
and having fun the fourth and fifth dab

1001
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,960
that is just me abusing it because I've

1002
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,559
got a lot of dabs and I like to see how

1003
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,039
high we can get today yeah but in the

1004
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,279
morning when I'm here by myself and I

1005
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:43,358
need some thinking to do and I got to

1006
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,839
clear my head and I got a lot of [ __ ] on

1007
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,078
my mind and the world's going too fast

1008
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:48,519
for me to get away from it all uh turn

1009
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,159
off all the lights turn off the TV turn

1010
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:52,519
off the phone turn off the computer get

1011
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,800
as silent as I can roll up a big fat

1012
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:57,719
spliff of Just Flowers just buds buds

1013
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,400
that I grew uh my own personal hidden

1014
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:02,039
way bud that nobody else has access to

1015
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,960
nobody gets to see roll that up smoke a

1016
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:06,679
big fatty middle finger size joint by

1017
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,760
myself and close my eyes and just see

1018
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:11,159
what I am really thinking because

1019
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,880
sometimes my head's just going too fast

1020
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,639
to even really hear what I'm thinking

1021
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,079
and when I get nice and Blaze and just

1022
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:20,118
close my eyes and just shut up for a

1023
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:23,160
minute and get into that quiet space Oh

1024
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:24,599
that's that's the truth it's not I

1025
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:26,399
didn't really I'm not mad about some

1026
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,280
Facebook [ __ ] Facebook doesn't matter

1027
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
once you close your eyes and go into

1028
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,440
that bubble whatever she said on

1029
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,159
Facebook doesn't matter that guy talking

1030
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,240
[ __ ] about your Instagram picture you

1031
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:37,679
don't really care you're you're missing

1032
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:39,559
your favorite TV show oh well you

1033
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,519
realize like what's inside and it just

1034
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:43,078
kind of it shows me more what I really

1035
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,599
need to pay attention to and it kind of

1036
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,079
calms me down a little bit see I felt

1037
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,599
like I had the opposite thing for me

1038
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,839
especially since I haven't been smoking

1039
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,920
pot and smoking anything or doing

1040
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,119
anything really for the past like 40

1041
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,920
days and 50 days however many days it's

1042
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,240
been is uh I was definitely abusing it I

1043
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,519
I smoked

1044
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,799
too much needlessly just to smoke it

1045
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:03,960
just to see how high I could get like

1046
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,480
you're saying and uh I'm gonna take a

1047
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,920
dab right now it wouldn't it wouldn't

1048
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,280
necessarily like clear my mind or help

1049
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,920
me think straight or anything it would

1050
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,280
kind of just make me think in worse ways

1051
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,920
because I was always second guessing

1052
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,240
myself and I was just overthinking

1053
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,280
things and then my brain wouldn't shut

1054
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:20,519
off because of it so now that i' I

1055
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,240
haven't been smoking I felt like it's

1056
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,480
greatly improved like my writing and

1057
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:27,199
just my My overall sense of being that

1058
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,400
was something I wanted to touch on uh

1059
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,838
kind of Chang the vibe a little bit I

1060
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,280
know Clint's kind of uh I'm going to

1061
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,000
call you lightweight bro you smoke weed

1062
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,960
like a little girl yeah but you're a

1063
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,440
cheap date so I love it he's a big man

1064
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,280
too yeah he's I bring my own weed so

1065
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,000
that way it's not even like imposing on

1066
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,400
anybody else like but he showed up with

1067
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,358
I smoked your weed and it was tasty

1068
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,720
that's some pretty tasty Bubba cush it

1069
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,119
didn't taste bad it didn't make my mouth

1070
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,039
burn and it got me ston it good weed

1071
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,519
good uh he came over and took one rip

1072
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:56,719
off of a pipe so when you write some

1073
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,239
comedy do you like write it when you're

1074
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,199
straight and then bellish it when you

1075
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,879
get lit or how does smoking affect your

1076
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:04,318
writing where does it come into play no

1077
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,400
there's it's kind of like uh there's two

1078
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:08,679
Clint in that aspect cuz there's Stone

1079
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:13,680
Clint and then there's sober Clint and

1080
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:16,199
uh and never the two shall meet but um

1081
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,960
no they uh Stone Clint can write some

1082
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:21,159
[ __ ] it's [ __ ] some of the [ __ ] that

1083
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,000
comes out that I find in my phone when I

1084
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:28,118
sober up is what the [ __ ] was I thinking

1085
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,800
like this is so weird and and then I see

1086
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,720
and I remember what I was trying to do

1087
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,880
with it but there's no way I would have

1088
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:37,559
ever written that sober okay and and I

1089
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,079
you know I've I I write a lot and in

1090
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:41,078

1091
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:44,560
whole lot I just been taking some time

1092
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:46,839
away from Comedy just just to clear my

1093
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:48,838
head trying to get my medications

1094
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:51,679

like anti-depressants cuz old happy

1096
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,960

1098
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,480
therapy and then seeing a one-onone

1099
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,519
are you yeah I've been seeing a

1100
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,719
therapist too and it's that's like my

1101
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,079
favorite time of the week like I go talk

1102
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,480
with a dude for like an hour and he's

1103
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,359
just like dude I got your back I don't

1104
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,318
care what you say like and I don't do

1105
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,199
anything that's terrible but I don't do

1106
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:15,279
anything or I don't feel like I'm doing

1107
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,118
good enough anyway what I was getting at

1108
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,400
is like oh I I feel both ways I'll get

1109
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,119
real introspective like you do Jeff and

1110
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,800
like what what is the problem that I'm

1111
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:26,358
feeling and then deal with it right in

1112
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,480
that moment but I've also gotten the way

1113
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:31,318
that Paul gets and where it's like all

1114
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,880
right why is that making me feel this

1115
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:35,480
way it's because of this it's because of

1116
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,000
this I need to like quit doing

1117
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,039
everything that I do wrong and only work

1118
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,239
because I got a 13-year-old daughter and

1119
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:42,279
I'm afraid she's not going to get to

1120
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:44,279
College because she wants to be a

1121
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,960
surgeon then I start dwelling on that

1122
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,599
and that freaks me out yeah so but I get

1123
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,159
like the super happy way too like you

1124
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,760
know this joke that I wrote just and

1125
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,519
maybe it's a little bit long but you go

1126
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,880
and edit it when you're sober and it's

1127
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,079
great and then you tell it when you're

1128
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,519
so I only

1129
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,680
I don't like getting up in front of

1130
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:06,519
people stoned because I feel like that's

1131
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:07,679
my time to to be on point yeah oh yeah

1132
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,800
for sure when you're on the spotlight

1133
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,838
you need to be on the spotlight yeah I

1134
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,000
used to do a lot of mic time high and

1135
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,279
now that I'm not high it's I've it's so

1136
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,880
much better for me I feel and Doug

1137
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,480
Benson bro I love you but I'm gonna say

1138
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,200
this out loud I feel Doug Benson being

1139
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,719
so high really squishes his comedy he

1140
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,919
could be a better performer if he

1141
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,159
weren't so high yeah like I could see it

1142
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,079
it slows down I've seen him for I've I

1143
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,199
personally have gotten Doug Benson so

1144
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,400
high before a show that he's just

1145
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,480
flubbed in complete bits and looked at

1146
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,000
me and said rosta Jeff you got me way

1147
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,760
too high like he told me on stage that I

1148
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,719
got him too high yeah like that's you'd

1149
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,000
never see a lot of other comedians you

1150
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,199
see Bill Cosby doing that I'll tell you

1151
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,358
that much

1152
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:52,159
well I like the silence that you just

1153
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:54,159
brought to the show dropped it I don't

1154
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,078
know it's like picking on Bill Cosby is

1155
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,759
like picking on Michael Jackson like

1156
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,079
it's the people have chosen side and if

1157

no idea what the [ __ ] I was going to say

1186
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,440
Sor I got excited we were talking about

1187
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,000
when we were writing and stuff yeah and

1188
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,760
uh yeah it's it's it's both ways though

1189
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,358
like I can be stoned and right but it my

1190
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,040
inspiration just comes from like the

1191
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:07,759
weirdest [ __ ] just man like watching an

1192
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,358
infomercial and it's like what the [ __ ]

1193
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,160
why am I thinking about like this

1194
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,519
different way to watch YouTube all of a

1195
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,000
sudden yeah like it's it's and see

1196
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,199
that's where that's that's kind of how I

1197
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,318
started out with just like trying to

1198
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,719
write comedy about funny situations or

1199
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,480
just like little things that I think of

1200
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,239
and I can't do that anymore now I have

1201
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,679
to it's all written about my personal

1202
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,639
experiences and about like my personal

1203
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:30,000
feelings and stuff keeps it better I

1204
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,078
think when you're telling like listen to

1205
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,358
any artist that's written an album about

1206
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,039
themselves that was real that first

1207
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,960
album that most people come out with

1208
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:39,199
it's their real life experience right

1209
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,480
that second and third album It's Studio

1210
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,039
pressure and they ran out of life

1211
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,079
experience cuz now they're just being a

1212
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:45,358
musician or that or they really took

1213
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,318
something from that experience and they

1214
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,838
made another one but a lot of times and

1215
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:52,119
I'm not trying to say that Maus Yahoo's

1216
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:53,279
first album live at stub BW his load but

1217
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:54,480
you could tell he spent his whole life

1218
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,880
writing that and then after that he's

1219
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,519
like oh I have to make another album

1220

my ganja meditation to your writing

1390
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,040
session like when you're just being ston

1391
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:54,760
and being goofy that's you're doing

1392
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,838

1393
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,160
in a different way you're meditating and

1394
00:47:56,838 --> 00:47:59,880

internet connection where you can like

1496
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:25,199
watch stuff I don't have to it's not the

1497
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:27,400
same I agree it's a lot of people like

1498
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:29,919
vinyl and they will not use the I became

1499
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,358
a nerd in a video store that was like my

1500
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,240
favorite thing to do when my parents

1501
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:35,119
would not want to deal with me and they

1502
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:36,598
just like I'll just take him to the

1503
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,358
video store so we can rent a movie and a

1504
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:40,119
in a game and that's where I became a

1505
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:42,558
nerd and like that's where I first saw

1506
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,119
my first horror big box and really got

1507
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,040
intrigued by the cover art by it and

1508
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:49,920
that's really why when I go out and I

1509
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:52,039
search through tons and tons of tapes at

1510
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,838
thrift stores I see something that I've

1511
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:55,318
never seen before but the cover Art's

1512
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:57,199
really good but the movie is [ __ ]

1513
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:59,719
terrible I love it because the cover

1514
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:02,199
Art's so good and I just love shitty

1515
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:04,239
movies what's the shittiest what's the

1516
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:07,000
best shitty movie you've watched the

1517
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:10,000
best shitty movie is definitely you're

1518
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,559
the hunter from the future that is the

1519
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,639
the shittiest [ __ ] movie I have ever

1520
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,880
seen it starts out kind of like a

1521
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:20,159
fantasy epic where they're fighting

1522
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,280
dinosaurs and barbarians and there's a

1523
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,159
point when he uses uh he uses a

1524
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,200
pterodactyl as a hang glider to kick

1525
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,318
someone in the face as you do and then

1526
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:29,439
it just Segways into now he's the hunter

1527
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,480
from the future so I should have seen

1528
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,039
this coming it Segways into Androids and

1529
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,639
spaceships and all kinds of [ __ ] it's

1530
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,239
just the weirdest [ __ ] thing I've

1531
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,798
ever seen holy [ __ ] it's amazing though

1532
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:40,679
