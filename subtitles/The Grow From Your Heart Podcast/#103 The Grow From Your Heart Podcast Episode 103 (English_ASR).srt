1
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:06,080

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,809
boy Rasta Jeff coming to you live from

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,788
the car on Interstate 25 that's right I

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:12,649
just left the champs trade show I

5
00:00:10,788 --> 00:00:14,718
thought it'd be a good idea to jump on

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,089
the microphone and do a little bit of

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:20,118
recording while it's still fresh in my

8
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:21,649
mind so today I went to the champs trade

9
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:23,989
show in Denver it was a beautiful Drive

10
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:26,719
it takes me about two hours to get up to

11
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:28,358
Denver it took me about another 20

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,879
minutes to find a good parking spot

13
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,990
anyway I got a good parking spot I

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,109
messaged a good friend of mine who had a

15
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,310
pass for me we met up and he got me a

16
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:38,719
pass for champs he gave me a high-five

17
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,359
and told me to have a good time he had

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,600
[ __ ] to do so he sent me on my way and I

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,429
headed into the champs trade show you

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,010

21
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,780

22
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,519

23
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,039
something I don't know what it means

24
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,560

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:02,530

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:05,058

27
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,189

our good friends were there you guys I

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,770
got to visit the Hitman booth if I was a

41
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,540
man if I didn't walk away from the

42
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:44,329
Hitman booths today I was going to spend

43
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,710
a lot of money with hitman they had two

44
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:47,899
rigs that I was really interested in

45
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:49,699
they had the mini they have the new I

46
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,830
forget what they call Nokomis sundae

47
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,329
stack or something like that it's not

48
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:56,239
the sundae cup but it's this little

49
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,739
stack thing the mini stack holy [ __ ]

50
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,658
they got bad water in it they let me

51
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:01,250
pull through it that thing felt like it

52
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,440
would hit like a champ unfortunately you

53
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,420
guys there was no consumption in this

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,300
venue we were not allowed to smoke any

55
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,310
type of cannabis we couldn't dab

56
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,400
there was actually somebody pressing out

57
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,870
rosin dabs he had a rosin press if you

58
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,810
know about rosin it's made by squishing

59
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,459
your buds between two heated surfaces

60
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,949
using parchment in the middle is a way

61
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,659
to catch your hash he was pressing out

62
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:25,219
rosin right there for you so you could

63
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,199
bring your nugs and get him squished as

64
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,699
what they were calling it some people

65
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,929
were taking dabs of that right after

66
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,939
they would squish it although it was

67
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,219
frowned upon and if you got caught they

68
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,050
would escort you out of the building so

69
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,000
anyway I met up with the hitman crew I

70
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,570
fell in love with a couple of rigs they

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,979
had a mini sidecar rig with a blue label

72
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,699
the blue label was beautiful it's my

73
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,530
favorite color

74
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,389
my exact favorite color blue

75
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,759
unfortunately I just bought the same rig

76
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:52,129
with a yellow label so I could not bring

77
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,780
myself to spend another 150 dollars on a

78
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,090
rig although a hundred and fifty dollars

79
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,610
on that rig was a steal I just didn't

80
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,379
want to buy a copy of a rig that I have

81
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,300
already got did not make sense to me

82
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,799
anyway so I had to walk away before I

83
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,050
bought the sunday stack and before I

84
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,459
bought the blue mini sidecar they had a

85
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,420
bunch of great rigs at the Hitman booth

86
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:15,319
also I made friends with a bunch of

87
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:17,750
people i also got to bump into our crew

88
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,419
with oil slick josh moil slick and the

89
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,669
oil slick crew was there in full force

90
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:24,530
they sent me home with the sample of the

91
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,479
I forget the official name of it I've

92
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,209
been calling it the bond condom it's

93
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,649
actually a it's basically a condom you

94
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,030
put on the mouthpiece of your bong so

95
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,159
that if you're at a large party or an

96
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,199
event you can swap those out so that not

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,750
everybody has to get the that we call it

98
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,009
the cup cough or the look flu so they

99
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,110

00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:09,469

199
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,560
internet on Twitter on Instagram

200
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,600
whatever you saw her on she is even more

201
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,370
beautiful in person and her personality

202
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,070
is sassy and stunning

203
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,840
so I'm walking toward her and she

204
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:22,490
spotted me and she reached out and put

205
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,909
her hand on my shoulder and said hey you

206
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,740
and she knew who I was which was kind of

207
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,330
weird I've stalked her on Facebook and

208
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,610
said hello but she has no reason to know

209
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:32,990
who rasta Jeff is so I was a little

210
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,430
excited by that that made me a little

211
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,000
spellbound it made me feel like a high

212
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,170
school boy so I stopped and I asked her

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,730
if I could give her a hug and she said

214
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,100

fully support what Tim Martin is doing

326
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,570
Tim Martin's a great dude

327
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,429
Tim and I actually talked about doing a

328
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,440
couple of shows together so in the very

329
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,209

00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:38,389
like I can take the show anywhere I did

337
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:40,399
not record anything today I felt rude I

338
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:41,750
didn't even think about taking my gear

339
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,980
in there because it felt rude walking

340
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,629
around I just wanted to say hi to my

341
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,570
friends and hang out and not be that

342

interview guy in the future I will do

343
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,140

344
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:52,129

345
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,689

conversation that him and I had today

353
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:11,030

391
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:26,088
me completely intrigued Fox is now in

392
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,708

best to link up with him and get him to

395

397

some amazing [ __ ] happening I cannot

398
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,069
wait for you guys to get to hear it so I

399
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:43,429
think that's all of this shout outs I've

400
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,470
got a guy gave me an edible to try but

401
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:47,269
I'm not going to do a shout out on that

402
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,709
or any review until I'm able to sit down

403
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,440
and look at the packaging and eat it

404
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:53,239
right now I'm driving on Interstate 25

405
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,529
going about 70 miles an hour there's

406
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,930
nobody else out on the interstate it's

407
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:58,100
just me it's a Wednesday night it's

408
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:00,469
pretty mellow I'm actually driving

409
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,329
through Monument right now shout out to

410
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,709
the city of monument and shout out to

411
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:05,328
that cop that didn't pull me over a few

412
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,578
miles back I'm full on talking into a

413
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:07,819
microphone and that cop did not pull me

414
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:09,859
over

415
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,329
that's pretty killer so let's see I

416
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,490
think I've done all these shoutouts I

417
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:14,838

418

420
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,370
to everybody that I hung out today I

421
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,198
apologize if I skipped you I want to

422
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,470
move on to this next part you guys I was

423
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:30,019
gifted from a vendor a Jeep in mini

424
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,959
disposable is called the Jeep in

425
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:35,179
disposable vaporizer it's got a battery

426
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,979
already in it you're supposed to use it

427
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:39,019
until it dies and then you're supposed

428
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,240
to throw it away so it's got

429
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:43,310
instructions of press the button five

430
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,100
times to turn it on unscrew the

431
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:48,169
mouthpiece lows load with your desired I

432
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,569
think it said essential oil is what it

433
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:52,009
said on the packaging and then it said

434
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:55,039
screw on the cap and then it said press

435
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:57,049
the button and inhale so I was gifted

436
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,208
this it's a yellow Jeep in disposable

437
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:01,219
it's the concentrate version I have

438
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,859
followed the instructions i unscrewed I

439
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,899
loaded I turned it on I screwed it back

440
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,068
together now you guys we were going to

441
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,990
press the button and we're going to

442
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:11,629
inhale and we're going to see what kind

443
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,190
of drawers we get off of the Jeep in

444
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:15,549
disposable let's check it out right now

445
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,550
here we go

446
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,820
so it's dead silent I know it's shitty

447
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:33,739
for podcasting but I loaded it with New

448
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,060
York City diesel live resin that I got

449
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,610
from Spence from the garden of Weeden

450
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:39,078
big shout out to Spence and it tastes

451
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,149
really good but honestly I didn't get a

452
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:42,379
bit of smoke it's lighting up like it

453
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,919
should let's try this again let's give

454
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,919
it another pull

455
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,980
so honestly I just got some hash in my

456
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:02,818
mouth which tastes really good but

457
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,319
there's no smoke and it's not working

458
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:06,838
the way that you would really expect a

459
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,610
hash pin to work I packed it down

460
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,129
properly it comes with a little uh a

461
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,110
little pokers he can uh yeah live resin

462
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,220
in my mouth I gave it a little poker so

463
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,329
that you could pack it down in there and

464
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,430
it's packed down in there it's pressed

465
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:20,008
against the coil I've used plenty of

466
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:22,138
hash pins in my day and this one so far

467
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:24,269
two hits in I'm ready to throw it out

468
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,009
the [ __ ] window if I hadn't loaded it

469
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:27,810
up with some decent New York City live

470
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:29,370
resin it would be out the window the car

471
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:32,039
by now so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna

472
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,568
hold it up right to where the hash will

473
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,129
melt into the coil when I press the

474
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:37,979
button and I'm gonna let it melt for a

475
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:40,920
couple of seconds I'm doing that it's

476
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,420
lit up it seems to be doing its thing so

477
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,179
now I'm hoping that I've melted the hash

478
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,458
down gravity wise into the coil and I'm

479
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,838
gonna hold it to where it you know what

480
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,159
I mean right it's where the [ __ ] hash

481
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,500
is melting into the coil while I hit it

482
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,208
I'm gonna give it a give it a third try

483
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,740
and we're gonna see how this goes so

484
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,659
excuse me for one second you'll get more

485
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,039
silence but I'm gonna try this hopefully

486
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,519
we don't end up with hash down my throat

487
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,519
while I'm driving

488
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:17,029
no smoke and a little more hash in my

489
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,380
mouth so we will try this again on an

490
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:19,579
episode at home when we're in the house

491
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,000
to where we're not driving in the car

492
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:27,679
trying to do this but so far the

493
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,599
disposable Jeep in I find it to be a

494
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,310
fail I think you press it five times to

495
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,859
turn it off let's see one two three four

496
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,149
or five they flashed and went off I'm

497
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:38,089
gonna set that in the seat next to me

498
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,160
next to the microphone case and we're

499
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:41,329
gonna say fail on that for now you guys

500
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,160
gotta take a quick drink so I have a

501
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:47,000
bunch of chunks of wax stuck in my teeth

502
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,200
no live resin in my mouth so we've been

503
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,250
going for a few minutes give me just one

504
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,870
second I'm gonna set down the microphone

505
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,970
I'll edit this out but I need to take a

506
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,949
drink hold on I got because of that pen

507
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,190
I've got melted wax in my teeth hold on

508
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,190
here we go

509
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,960
all right I might add it a few seconds

510
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:15,839
of that out I apologize guys that take a

511
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,850
drink there's nothing like having hash

512
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,269
smeared across your two front teeth I

513
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:22,469
was weird alright so where was I I was

514
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:24,779
talking about the champs trade show

515
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,529
right you guys champs trade show was at

516
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:30,180
the Denver Convention Center it was free

517
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:32,009
they make it seem like you need to be

518
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,390
some sort of a vendor or have some sort

519
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:37,049
of a license to get in there but

520
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,880
honestly I don't have well I do I have

521
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,259
an LLC in ship but I walked up and said

522
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,680
hey I'm here and they said what company

523
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,129
are you with

524
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,480
and I said I was with my buddy Tim and

525
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,280
he didn't even say anything I said I'm

526
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,799
with organic ax and they looked at Tim

527
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,269
and Tim to Thorg antica and so they said

528
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,710
what's your name and I said Rasta Jeff

529
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:54,779
and she wrote my name on a little tag

530
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,220
and handed it to me no questions asked

531
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,920
it didn't cost me anything champs is a

532
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,660
free event if you're in the industry if

533
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,830
not all you gotta do is have a good

534
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,330
reason to be there and tell them that

535
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:05,009
that's why you're there if you have like

536
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:06,569
a wholesale license or something like

537
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:08,490
that you can definitely get in if not

538
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:09,750
you've got a friend that has a way to

539
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,109
get you in the Champs if you want to

540
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,670
good want to go um it's free which is a

541
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,529
good thing because it's not really worth

542
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,700
a whole bunch of money to walk through

543
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:20,099
there if it was like a five dollar

544
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,450
ticket I wouldn't complain I was a cool

545
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,009
event there's nowhere to sit down

546
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,509
it's illegal to medicate in the building

547
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:25,890
it's illegal to consume cannabis in the

548
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,990
building you can't even hit a vape pen

549
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,980
they did not like that of course like I

550
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,529
said there were a couple of people

551
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,849
taking a couple of rosin dabs but they

552
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:35,129
would have been escorted out had they

553
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:37,709
been caught um it was a great event it

554
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,270
was fun I had a good time the best part

555
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,740
for me honestly was linking up with a

556
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:43,019
bunch of people from the industry I

557
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,940

558

560
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:49,740
together hanging out I almost [ __ ]

561
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,940
spaced it you know why because our

562
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,910
conversation was just friendly and

563
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,450
natural wasn't something that had to be

564
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,740
documented it was just a good

565
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,850
conversation which I love

566

570
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,110
fun hanging out that was my favorite

571
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,210
part was meeting up with people and

572
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:14,099
shaking hands and seeing everybody was a

573
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,150
really really good time so it's a great

574
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,939
place to go if you're in the industry

575
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,920
and you know a few people you can buy a

576
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,720
lot of great glass at very great

577
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,850
discounted prices

578
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,829
I saw some beautiful beautiful glass but

579
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:28,289
you guys honestly I'm not into buying

580
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:30,089
really artful glass lately I've been

581
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:32,399
buying what they call production work

582
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:34,879
and functional glass is just clear and

583
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,290
hits like a champ I hate it when I spend

584
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,060
hundreds to a thousand dollars on a nice

585
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:40,500
rig hold on I gotta put the microphone

586
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:44,159
down here cuz the car just gonna be one

587
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,539
second alright I just didn't want that

588
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,980
car to see me talking into the mic I

589
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,180
hate it when you spend a lot of money or

590
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,910
your friends spend a lot of money on a

591
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,289
rig and you can only put like a really

592
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,090
certain amount of water in there because

593
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,920
one drop more it splashes in your mouth

594
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:57,959
and one drop less it doesn't perk right

595
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,240
I found that to be really annoying on a

596
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,860
custom-made piece so I buy production

597
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,539
pieces that are clear and I think they

598
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,949
hit like a [ __ ] champ you guys I

599
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:06,869
think there's nothing wrong with having

600
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,190
a clear rig you don't even need to spend

601
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:09,779
a lot of money on a rig you guys you

602
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,120
could have spent 40 bucks on a really

603
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,889
nice rig today and been set up you could

604
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,349
have got a highly-educated titanium male

605
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,220
and a carb cap for a really good price

606
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:19,439
champs is a great place if you're

607
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,759
looking to come up on a rig or two or if

608
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,320
you've got a wholesale license it was

609
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,410
really the place to buy a whole bunch of

610
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,269
[ __ ] alright so also shot it's a

611
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:31,440
grassroots grassroots was they're set up

612
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:33,059
in style yeah so for a free event it was

613
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,009
really a good time it was a great day in

614
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,950
Denver it rained a little bit but that

615
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:39,629
didn't slow anybody down

616
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,860
most of the vendors that I really

617
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,070
appreciated seeing will be at the

618
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:46,199
Cannabis Cup in Denver or excuse me I'm

619
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:48,119
burpin they'll be at the Cannabis Cup in

620
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,710
Denver in April if that happens there's

621
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:51,000
rumors that that may not happen I'm not

622
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,200
gonna start talking [ __ ] about it on the

623
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,880
show but there have been rumors if that

624
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,069
won't happen let's hope that it does

625
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,110
most of those vendors will be available

626
00:21:56,069 --> 00:22:00,029
and present at the Cannabis Cup in full

627
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:02,189
force if there's a cannabis cup in your

628
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:04,379
area I bet those vendors will be there

629
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,000
make sure you look out for oil slick get

630
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,100
an oil slick pad keep your table from

631
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,440

632
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:12,000
man glass hit man makes really good

633
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,130
glass that hits like a truck every

634
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,450
[ __ ] time when you get new glass what

635
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,340
do you need you need a new nail who do

636
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,170
you go for for that you go to highly

637
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,269
educated titanium you get yourself a

638
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,880
nail I like a domeless nail and a carb

639
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:25,589
cap I think that's the way to go then

640
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,850
you need some cool ass t-shirts who do

641
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:28,139
you get your t-shirts printed through

642
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:29,789
you go to handmade

643
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,620
peril there's another car on the highway

644
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:32,670
