up the throat but it puts me in the

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,680
greatest mood the greatest zone for

62
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,959
podcasting that machine puts on these

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,879
blinders all i could really pay

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,719
attention to is that camera these lights

65
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,719
kind of went away the notes right here

66
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,840
really digging the vibe of the machine

67
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,280

68
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,719
throat pretty phenomenal concentrates

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,878

70
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,000

73
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,919
let's quit rambling and focus in let's

74
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,559
do a podcast all right let's do a deep

75
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,479
dive into mother plants mother plants

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,759
are a very important aspect of cannabis

77
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,919
cultivation

78
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,679
let's talk about what a mother plant is

79
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,359
then we'll talk about how to establish a

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,599
mother plant then we'll talk a little

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,360
more deeply into mother plants let's get

82
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,199
started by talking about what a mother

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,040
plant is what am i talking about mother

84
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,280
plant what does that even mean

85
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,679
when we cultivate cannabis oftentimes we

86
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,959
will find a plant that we kind of fall

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
in love with something you want to keep

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,199
smoking over and over and over again you

89
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,639
want to keep growing it as a breeder as

90
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,719
a grower i like to grow something

91
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,318
multiple times i like to grow it uh the

92
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,318
first time i grow it i call it the first

93
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,238
date i'm just gonna give it the standard

94
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,238
operating procedure the basic nutrients

95
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,878
the basic grow room we'll see how that

96
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,400
plant reacts to the room the second time

97
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,759
i'll say well last time it didn't react

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
to the cool it didn't react well to the

99
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,878
hot it didn't like these nutrients it

100
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,039
could have done better with this i will

101
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,560
give it those things every time i grow

102
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,120
that plant i'll take notes i'll pay

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,959
attention i will observe i will sample

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
and i will make adjustments every grow

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,799
and by the third fifth sixth grow that

106
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,239
plant will be banging it'll be doing

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,439
much better than the first time that i

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,680
grew up because i've developed a

109
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,840
relationship with that plant now how do

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,000
i continue to grow that plant i need to

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,438
keep a mother plant of that plant let's

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
just get into so we know what a mother

113
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,239
plant is that mother plant in the future

114
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,438
is going to be

115
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,799
designated to give us clones to keep our

116
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,318
genetics alive in the future it's a

117
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
mother plant that stays in the room

118
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,839
unflowered and we can take cuttings from

119
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,199
that to turn them into clones or

120
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,438
clippings or reproductions of our

121
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,759
original plant and we can continually

122
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,079
grow this plant over and over again this

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,680
one never goes into flower we save it

124
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,439
it's like our little genetic preserve so

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,879
that is a mother plant how do we get to

126
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,839
a mother plant that's a very good

127
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,000
question

128
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,839
let's say we are either given a pack of

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,079
seeds or we are given a clone or we

130
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,519
acquire a clone or a pack of seeds so

131
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,680
let's start with a pack of seeds let's

132
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,519
say we are given a 10 pack of seeds you

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,879
just are gifted a pack of seeds i was

134
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,799
super nice i was like hey bro want some

135
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,319
seeds you're like i sure do or whoever

136
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
whatever i called you and i gave you a

137
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,478
10 pack of seeds and you grew them now

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,160
you're going to find an amazing plant

139
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,680
out of that 10 pack you'll find one that

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
really stands out to you we will do it

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,079
as a fino hunt we will grow all of these

142
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,359
seeds we will carefully observe them

143
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,800
watch how they grow there's going to be

144
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,639
a couple of plants in there that really

145
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,639
stand out one's going to not even be

146
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
desirable to you but maybe to somebody

147
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,160
else one's going to really stand out to

148
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,679
you one's going to be pretty good you're

149
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,520
probably going to get one that puts out

150
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,038
a lot of weight one that really tastes

151
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,959
good and then one of those will be super

152
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,959
potent there's always two that it's hard

153
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,799
to decide between which keepers you want

154
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,879
to keep let's talk about keeping one of

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,120
those as a mother plant what i would do

156
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,879
i would grow those seeds until they are

157
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,959
big enough to get a clone we talked

158
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,959
about cloning earlier i would take three

159
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,038
clones from each seedling now i've got

160
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,359
three opportunities to keep these plants

161
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,120
alive i would grow them out i would

162
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,439
either at this point what i would do as

163
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,879
soon as my clones show roots i would

164
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,240
flower these plants that have been

165
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,000
growing they're already established

166
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
they're already pretty big let's just

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,519
flower those out see what we've got

168
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,519
we'll pull the males immediately once

169
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,918
these plants i put in flowers show mail

170
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,599
i will also call that male clone if i'm

171
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,599
not looking for a male and this in this

172
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
final hunt we're just looking for a mom

173
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,879
to make a mother plant for a good keeper

174
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,879
to make a mother plant so we're going to

175
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,719
grow all of these seedlings we're going

176
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,759
to cut a clone we're going to put the

177
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,520
mom the original plant into flower when

178
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,080
those show us sex we will call all of

179
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,478
the boys the small boys and the big boys

180
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,240
now we are only down to the females one

181
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,159
thing i should mention carefully label

182
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
all of your plants the way i do it is

183
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,840
either alphabetically or numerically

184
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,918
i've just got plants a through z or

185
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,719
we're in colorado a through six whatever

186
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,719
number six is in the alphabet uh or 12

187
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,400
depending on where we are i number them

188
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,000
one through six one through twelve then

189
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,318
when i take clones the clones get the

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,319
corresponding number clone number one

191
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
came from plant number one clones number

192
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
two came from plant number two clones

193
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
labeled three came from plant three

194
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,079
makes it easy so if my plant number five

195
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,319
shows that it's a male clone five is a

196
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,000
male it goes bye-bye if number one shows

197
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,360
it's a girl number one is a girl that

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,439
gets to stay that's the way that works

199
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,879
so we eliminate the boys now we grow out

200
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,478
the females

201
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,079
pay attention some of them you're gonna

202
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,240
love some you're going to hate find the

203
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,318
one that you really really do love the

204
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,079
first time i run it i may keep two maybe

205
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,598
three of the females we've eliminated

206
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,439
the boys we've gotten rid of the

207
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,598
non-desirable females now let's really

208
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,959
run these girls one more time and see

209
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,560
what we really love i don't know what

210
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,399
you're going to do you could do it the

211
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,160
one time you could do it a couple times

212
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,359
find the girls you like

213
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,960
in this case we're just going to pick

214
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,240
one we're going to say we found the one

215
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,560
that we really liked we're going to say

216
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
it was number two in my case it often is

217
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,839
number two one number one's a boy number

218
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
two is quite often the keeper number

219
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,359
four is a champ is just weird luck of

220
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,120
the draw for me so number two we're

221
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960
gonna say number two was a [ __ ]

222
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,399
amazing female keeper plant we're gonna

223
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,879
keep that right we grew it out we

224
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,598
flowered it we smoked it it is awesome

225
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,038
luckily back in the day we kept a clone

226
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,639
of number two it's just growing it's

227
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,159
over there in the grow room just grow

228
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,079
and we've still got it we know number

229
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,080
two is the champ guess what that clone

230
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,519
that is growing over there that is now

231
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,519
your mother plant that's how you

232
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,598
establish a mother plant you cut the

233
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,439
clone what i do is i cut the clone off

234
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,839
the top of a veg plant i put it in the

235
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,839
cloner i let it clone i let it root as

236
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,758
soon as it gets roots i put it in a pot

237
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,359
that's when i flower my other plant now

238
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,038
i've got nine weeks to find out what the

239
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,439
winners are that other plant's gonna

240
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,519
grow over there for nine weeks before

241
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,439
nine weeks is up you've probably decided

242
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,519
what your favorite plant is so you've

243
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,399
got your favorite selected now i would

244
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,240
cut clones from my favorite one again

245
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,359
and i've already got clones ready for

246
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,439
the next run so we cut a clone off of

247
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,960
our original seated plant just cut a

248
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,639
clone right out of the top put it in the

249
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,598
cloner it's going to take two weeks to

250
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,960
root ish as soon as i see roots i flower

251
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,719
the one that's already in the pot the

252
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,478
big one that the clone came from we're

253
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
gonna find the boys and girls pull out

254
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,560
the boys find your favorite girl you'll

255
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,160
know you'll know probably by week seven

256
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,839
or week eight what your favorite girls

257
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
are your other plants are over here that

258
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,559
you took clones of they'll have to come

259
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,320
out of the clone or they'll go into pots

260
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,239
they'll start growing they're gonna get

261
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,000
bigger it's gonna be nine weeks before

262
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,759
we need them for anything my

263
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,480
recommendation is around week seven a

264
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,720
flower on this run cut clones now those

265
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,320
clones become your next run guess what

266
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,080
you just cut those from your mother

267
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
plants that you've got sitting over here

268
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,959
your favorite one over here will be

269
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,600
designated your mother plant let's move

270
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,239
it over here and focus now on mother

271
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,759
plants we've done a basic phenohunt we

272
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
have found the mother plant we choose to

273
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,080
keep we've got a nice bushy plant of

274
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,440
that mother plant right here we cut a

275
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,200
clone it grew it's been growing for

276
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,440
several weeks you may have not taken

277
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,519
clones off of it by now you may have now

278
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
is a good time to go and clean up this

279
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,360
mother plant i kind of do a little bit

280
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,560
of lollipopping a little bottoming just

281
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,560
to clean it up it's going to have some

282
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,479
funky useless [ __ ] at the bottom just

283
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,119
small wispy shoots coming off i take all

284
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,200
that stuff off then i want to make a

285
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,278
nice bushy plant because this is going

286
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,759
to be the plant that donates a bunch of

287
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,759
cuts to me when i need to grow again so

288
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,600
if i need i'm going to i know how many

289
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,278
clones i'm going to need for my next run

290
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,080
if i know i need three i don't need

291
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,600
super bushy of a plant if i need 25 cuts

292
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,360
i need to start topping this plant

293
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
strategically to make more branches and

294
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,440
more arms so that i can produce more

295
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
clones to supply my growth for the next

296
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,640
run and then every time you top it at

297
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,480
the right spot it's going to produce

298
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,159
double the nodes so the next time you

299
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
run it you should have plenty of clones

300
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,199
available for the next round if you got

301
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,278
25 this time you should be able to get

302
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,680
50 next time no problem because you

303
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,838
doubled all of the spaces so what i'm

304
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,759
going to do is i'm going to keep this

305
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,079
big mother plant nice and healthy as

306
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,639
healthy as i can i'm going to keep it

307
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,958
under at least 18 hours of light and six

308
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,439
hours of darkness a lot of times i will

309
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,919
go 19 hours of light and five hours of

310
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,079
darkness just to prevent any sort of

311
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,838
autoflower any sort of ideas that that

312
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,159
plant could have darkness long enough to

313
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,040
flower i do give them sleep time i

314
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,639
believe

315
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,799
anything wants a little bit of sleepy

316
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,559
time you need a nap the dog needs a nap

317
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,399
the plants can use an app also your

318
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,919
equipment can use a nap

319
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,919
if we turn off the lights for just four

320
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,599
or five hours a night that will save us

321
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,439
a lot of electricity a lot of time on

322
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
your bulbs a lot of time on the air

323
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
conditioner a lot of things that don't

324
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,560
have to run unless it's the winter and

325
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,480
then you got to turn on a heater that's

326
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,399
a whole another conversation keep them

327
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,159
under at least 18 hours of light some

328
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,720
people will go 19 some people will go

329
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,559
20. some will do the 24 that is not my

330
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
recommendation once again we all need a

331
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,479
nap you'll notice that they'll start

332
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,000
getting uh spindly and growing too tall

333
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,079
and getting weird on you if you don't

334
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
give them any nighttime i do think that

335
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,958
weird growth is a symptom of them just

336
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,120
they're freaking out dude they're

337
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,359
they're going crazy they need a nap feed

338
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
them excuse me feed them another very

339
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,519
important thing is to feed them i feed

340
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,200
them a high nitrogen diet i focus on

341
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,679
just mainly the basic npk in a good

342
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,278
vegetative nutrient solution you will

343
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,799
get most of the things needed for your

344
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,679
mother plants they need a little bit of

345
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,799
calmag definitely feed them microbes one

346
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:29,120
thing is i really step up my pesticide

347
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:32,000
application or my integrated pest

348
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,839
management routine in the mother room

349
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,440
area because it all starts with healthy

350
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,079
mother plants if your moms start getting

351
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,079
healthy your stock is or if they start

352
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,239
getting unhealthy your stock is

353
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,159
unhealthy it all starts right there so

354
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,480
have very healthy mother plants if at

355
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,480
all possible keep insects away from them

356
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,320
keep powdery mildew away from them keep

357
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,320
any viruses away from them keep those

358
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,480
mother plants clean those are sacred as

359
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,160
a breeder that's my that's everything

360
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,200
sacred to me is those mother plants so

361
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,120
keep them clean safe and healthy up your

362
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,920
step up your integrated pest management

363
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,839
game in that room is where it all starts

364
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,199
if you can't get healthy cuts you can't

365
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,399
get healthy plants if you can't have

366
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,079
healthy veg plants you can't have

367
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,320
healthy flower plants you can't breed

368
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,719
healthy seeds it all starts with healthy

369
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,480
moms healthy clones healthy veg get

370
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
those mother plants super healthy so

371
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,440
give them a lot of light give them a lot

372
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,759
of strong vegetative nutrients then also

373
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,360
give them a lot of cleanliness give them

374
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,519
a lot of pest management make sure there

375
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,320
are no bugs on there that's where it all

376
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,759
starts now um something else to talk

377
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,000
about is the goal and shape of your

378
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,399
plants how many clones do you need

379
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,240
i top them early because when i top them

380
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,399
all those lower branches start growing

381
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,799
up now think about when you you've got

382
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,240
an intersection we call it a node so

383
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,759
you've got the branch coming up and

384
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,759
shooting off to the left is just one

385
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,439
more little space and then right above

386
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,600
that going off to the right is one more

387
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,880
little space little branches so if you

388
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,560
cut that one out of the middle you've

389
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,480
now got the one going up off the left

390
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,078
and the one going up off the right those

391
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,560
eventually will even out and start

392
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,000
growing as new apical dominant tops if

393
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,000
you top it right think about that

394
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,759
strategically when you are cutting it

395
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,958
think about the plant kind of it looks

396
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,759
like i'm giving you the finger here on

397
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,199
the camera i'm not it looks like a three

398
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,799
it looks like a piece sign turned upside

399
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
down you got the one going up the middle

400
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,519
then you got your left branch and your

401
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,958
right branch if you cut that one out the

402
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,560
middle that's a much better hand gesture

403
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,319
there if you cut that one up the middle

404
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,479
these two will compete and become new

405
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,480
tops later on those will both become

406
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,480
cloned so take out this clone now you

407
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
get these two in the future then those

408
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,639
two repeat the process you get four

409
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,920
repeat the process you get eight repeat

410
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,240
the process if he comes into like

411
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,639
[ __ ] 64. right if you do it just it's

412
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,839
mathematically bra so keep cutting keep

413
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,000
cutting them keep topping and you will

414
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,240
make more tops something that will

415
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,320
happen eventually this will happen

416
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,680
there's you could do this

417
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,839
process as long as you want but

418
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,078
eventually you're going to need to

419
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,360
replace your mother plant right now

420
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,120
people are going to say what about

421
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,278
genetic drift that is not a thing i've

422
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,720
done a full podcast on why genetic drift

423
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,519
does not apply to cannabis and why it

424
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,040
doesn't apply to cloning cannabis so

425
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,560
wash genetic drift right out of your

426
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,319
brain that's not a thing if your mother

427
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,479
plants are healthy you cut clones

428
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,160
properly genetic drift will not be a

429
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,320
thing i've done a full episode on that

430
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,919
do some research check out the episode

431
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,000
one thing that will need to be done is

432
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,000
you will need to re-clone your mother

433
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
plants they will get big they will get

434
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,159
tall they'll start getting old they'll

435
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,159
get out of control that plant is it's

436
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,759
old no matter how long every time you

437
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,439
clone the plant that plant is still as

438
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,120
old as that original clone so it's got

439
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,800
that much age on it we've got to keep

440
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,360
these plants fresh we've got to reclone

441
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:34,078
them what i do every three to six months

442
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,919
depending on the plant um the sun-kissed

443
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,679
plant doesn't grow super are the uh the

444
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,599
platinum tangy doesn't grow super fast

445
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,519
it stays kind of smaller doesn't take as

446
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,920
much time mach one doesn't take as much

447
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,159
time i can remom that one every six

448
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,559
months the mighty congo the chem de la

449
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,600
cam they need remomed about every three

450
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,599
months so what i do i simply cut

451
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,079
a nice batch of clones i probably cut

452
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,079
one row uh five clones off of each plant

453
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,559
right so we got five congo we got five

454
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,879
uh camdella chems and then i just let

455
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,559
those root and the best two i pop them

456
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,958
the best two of each one i pot them then

457
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,799
i let them grow the best one goes in the

458
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,399
flower room the second best one becomes

459
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,399
the new mother plant that becomes my new

460
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,159
genetic that's the one that i get to

461
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,399
grow from from now on and that's gonna

462
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,159
repeat the process forever then that big

463
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,600
plant that i cut the clones from i

464
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,319
either flower that which most of the

465
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,920
time i do not do or i simply cut it into

466
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
small pieces and throw it away because i

467
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,159
don't need it i don't feel the need to

468
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,839
just grow it because i've got it that's

469
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,919
not what that plant was meant for it was

470
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,000
meant to provide clones it served its

471
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,759
purpose i've got all the cuts i need i

472
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
can chop that big bad dog down and throw

473
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,519
it away sometimes they'll go outside

474
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,519
sometimes they get floured in a flower

475
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,519
room sometimes they get pollinated most

476
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,198
of the time it's better for me just to

477
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,039
eliminate that plant start fresh with

478
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,319
those new cuts they're already so big

479
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,399
they're already stretched out that's why

480
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
i'm re-momming it they just get they get

481
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,519
out of control they get unruly and

482
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,838
unshapely if you're not strategically

483
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,278
cloning it all the time and on top of it

484
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,759
it will get out of control and even if

485
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,000
so it will get root bound it'll just get

486
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,480
old reclone it remom it get it started

487
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,519
fresh i do that again about every three

488
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,920
to six months is how i redo my moms now

489
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,198
let's talk about another scenario i know

490
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,838
a lot of people

491
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,159
myself included i'm here in colorado uh

492
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,600
in my personal grow i'm very limited on

493
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,439
the amount of plants that i would like

494
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,278
to have so

495
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,839
instead of wasting space on mother

496
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,720
plants in some cases what we will do we

497
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,040
will use a dedicated veg plant as our

498
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
mother plant so let's just say you grew

499
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,159
your you've got a clone right you know

500
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,439
that this clone is the winner you've

501
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,439
done your final hunt you've got the

502
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
winner you've got your clone right here

503
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
you just right before you're gonna

504
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,799
flower take a couple of clones off of it

505
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,599
and save them and now you've got three

506
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,519
or five clones in the cloning area you

507
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,759
move that plant into the flowering room

508
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,198
it'll flower in nine weeks now your your

509
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,199
clones are in there for two weeks they

510
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,559
come out of the cloner they go into

511
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,719
their pots they got two weeks in the

512
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,559
cloner uh two or three weeks in the

513
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,600
small pots and then like six weeks no

514
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,758
what do we got that's five you've got

515
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,680
four weeks in the bigger pots then move

516
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,078
those right into flour and take a couple

517
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,838
of cuts off of them and use your veg

518
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,000
plants as your mother plant kind of keep

519
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,599
a perpetual cycle going people are going

520
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,119
to say what about genetic drift again

521
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,399
i'm going to say that is not a thing as

522
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,519
long as you are keeping your plants

523
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,959
healthy

524
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,400
excuse me as long as your veg plants

525
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,318
your donor plant is what i want to call

526
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,240
it is a healthy plant your clones will

527
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,759
come out healthily if you do it properly

528
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,000
take good care of them

529
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,679
i've done full episodes on clone care

530
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,119
all of that stuff that's another topic

531
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,559
but let me talk about how to do that

532
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,319
again because i feel like i breezed over

533
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,399
it you've got your plant you're going to

534
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,240
flower it that plant is your mom plant

535
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,240
and your flower plant it's a veg plant

536
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,079
that will be flowered at the same time

537
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,359
you got a plant put it into the flower

538
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,439
room right before you change the light

539
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,678
cycle take three to five clones off of

540
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,679
it those clones will be the next run so

541
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,360
while this bad dog is flowering your

542
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,038
clones are rooting they'll root they'll

543
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,798
take two weeks as soon as these plants

544
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,798
in the flower room start showing sex and

545
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,200
going into flower you've got plants to

546
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,558
move from a cloned dome into pots as

547
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
soon as they really start banging out

548
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,759
flour you gotta up pop these and get

549
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
them ready start prepping them for the

550
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,160
next run slide them into flour as soon

551
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,519
as these finish take a couple clones

552
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,440
repeat the process you've got a

553
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,839
perpetual cycle without keeping mother

554
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,400
plants because you're keeping veg mother

555
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,798
plants at the same time all right ladies
