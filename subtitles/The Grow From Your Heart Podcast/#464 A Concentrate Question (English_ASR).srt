welcome to episode 465 of the Grove from

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:13,798
your heart podcast this episode of the

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,560
show is brought to you by my friends at

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,868
seeds here now if you need new regular

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,538
feminized or Auto flower seeds in your

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:27,140
garden I highly recommend seeds here now

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,140
and you can find them at www.ctvn.org

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,010
axe tract which means it is saucy and

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,520
has chunks of diamonds and crystals in

13
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:46,649
it the cross is a blend of ruby red and

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,079
to peel your face on the package they

15
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,840
describe the flavor as hops fuel and

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,299
grapefruit rind I honestly did not get

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,920
any hops I am NOT a fan of hops so it is

18
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,738
just fine that I do not catch the hops

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,750
aroma I do get a hint of fuel the

20
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,119
grapefruit rind is there but honestly

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,879
this tastes more to me like strawberries

22
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,859
and hints of watermelon I really enjoy

23
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,839
that fruity flavor it's a big switch

24
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,368
from what I normally go for when it

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,010
comes to concentrates lately I've been

26
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,500
buying the more savory flavors so it was

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,390
a nice change of pace a nice change of

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,030
aroma and flavor and definitely a

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,219
different buzz ah this went straight to

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,079
my head made me forgetful made me kind

31
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,219
of have a hard time paying attention

32
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,989
the potency label says 68% THC something

33
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,060
about this concentrate makes it hard to

34
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:35,578
focus so big shout out to our friends at

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,939
Green Dot labs for the delicious India

36
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:42,059
Pale Ale full spectrum extract I highly

37
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,129
recommend this concentrate this is going

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,868
to be a quick Thursday episode I do have

39
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,789
a couple of questions from some friends

learn how to support the show you can do

60
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:40,490
so by visiting www.disabilitydenials.com

61
00:02:42,439 --> 00:03:13,110
for a new cannabis breeder I probably

62
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,859
have a lot of other titles cannabis

63
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,930
advocate

64
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,950
cannabis activist cannabis photographer

65
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,050
there's a lot of other things that I

66
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:20,939
could probably be labeled as but I am a

67
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,620
grower I am a breeder those are the

68
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,289
things I find the most passion for

69
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,629
followed by photography so that is where

70
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,789
my heart lies I do not find much

71
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,949
interest in making concentrates I have

72
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:34,709
done it I know how to do it I understand

73
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:36,209
the process concentrate making is just

74
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,460
not where my passion lies

75
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,409
we've got great friends like Spence

76
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,670
we've got great friends like keV we've

77
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,509
got all the people that work at

78
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:44,429
apothecary

79
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:46,829
all the people that work at green dot of

80
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,050
the wonderful highly trained highly

81
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,930
skilled concentrate makers across the

82
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,570
country I am letting them do that work

83
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,000
for me it is a dangerous process it can

84
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,519
be a dangerous process making

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,800
concentrates that concentrates I enjoy

86
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,900
the concentrates I prefer are made with

87
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,240
butane if you are not familiar with a

88
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,430
butane extraction process it sounds like

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,159
it can be very dangerous yes you are

90
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,240
correct it can be very dangerous we are

91
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,090
working with a very flammable

92
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,189
hydrocarbon and any small mistake could

93
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,410
result in an explosion so I am leaving

94
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:21,209
to concentrate making up to the people

95
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,550
with the proper labs the proper

96
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,339
equipment and the proper training so

97
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,180
when it comes to acquiring safe reliable

98
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,429
koala

99
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,139
he concentrates I tend to shop at some

100
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,478
of my favorite dispensaries I always

101
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,639
mention apothecary I like the apothecary

102
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,139
concentrates they're a great concentrate

103
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,019
they have a great price point and

104
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,840
they're great folks I also really enjoy

105
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:45,089
Green Dot labs they make great products

106
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,978
they are a little higher in price point

107
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:49,049
compared to some concentrate companies

108
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:50,668
but you get what you pay for

109
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,530
I like their concentrates I like the

110
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:55,049
full-spectrum extracts I like the

111
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:57,869
batter's and I like their cartridges so

112
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,060
apothecary farms and Green Dot labs are

113
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,550
probably my two favorites there are

114
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,560
several companies competing for third

115
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,000
place

116
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,240
unfortunately I live in a smaller market

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,910
so the availability isn't as broad for

118
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,918
myself as some folks in other markets if

119
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,599
you're in Denver or Boulder you've got

120
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,549
many more options I'm down here in

121
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:19,589
Pueblo I've only got a few stores to

122
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,870
choose from that is not true I've got a

123
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,638
lot of stores to choose from many of

124
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,319
them are a waste of time so I've

125
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,360
narrowed it down to two or three stores

126
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,300
most of those stores they're top-shelf

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,729
product is either an apothecary extract

128
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,889
or a green dot labs concentrate so that

129
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:36,658
is why I buy my concentrates from the

130
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,210
dispensary now why am I not buying my

131
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:41,219
own strains because in Colorado we've

132
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:44,069
got some ridiculous rules

133
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,460
anything sold in a Colorado dispensary

134
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:50,250
must be grown and produced in a Colorado

135
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:53,668
marijuana Enforcement Division regulated

136
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,399
facility all of that makes sense we have

137
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:58,560
a program called seed to sale tracking

138
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,079
and it is exactly what it sounds like

139
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,030
from the inception of a seed from the

140
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,158
planting and germination of that seed

141
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,658
all the way through growth all the way

142
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:08,848
through harvest all the way through

143
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:11,189
trimming then whatever type of

144
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:13,139
processing is done to that flower if it

145
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:15,060
is turned into an extract if it is

146
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,400
turned into an edible if it is thrown

147
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,069
away at this point it is tracked all the

148
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,138
way to the point of retail at the

149
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:23,939
consumer level so it will be tracked

150
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,310
from the flour from the plant to the

151
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,839
flour dried and cured then one it is

152
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,879
sent once it is sent to an extraction

153
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,310
facility or an edible maker it is

154
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,930
tracked then they process it then it is

155
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,639
tracked that batch number of your flour

156
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,680
now becomes the batch number of that

157
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,810
edible or that concentrate that number

158
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,040
is now attached to that so if there's a

159
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,050
problem in the future with your

160
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,970
edible or with your concentrate we can

161
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,650
trace back which flower batch that came

162
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,440
from we can tell which grow that came

163
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:51,509
from or the opposite if we detect a

164
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,519
problem in the flower or in the

165
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:55,529
concentrate because every flower is lab

166
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,109
tested and every batch of concentrate is

167
00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:00,629
lab tested if a problem is detected we

168
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,220
were able to recall the products that

169
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,170
were made from that by following that

170
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,740
batch number down the line so there is a

171
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,629
seed to sale tracking system there was a

172
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,120
time period where we were allowed to

173
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,730
bring plants into that seed to sale

174
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,410
tracking system the governing body who

175
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,170
regulates the plants coming into that

176
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,939
system sort of turned a blind eye and

177
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,400
allowed us to enter plants into that

178
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:26,040
system for a limited amount of time the

179
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,839
plants had to come from somewhere so for

180
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,240
a short period of time the marijuana

181
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,219
enforcement division played dumb and

182
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,110
acted like all of these plants were just

183
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,120
part of some immaculate conception these

184
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,889
plants were just manifested and ended up

185
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,720
in our growth facilities and entered

186
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,909
into the computer they did not know what

187
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,650
else to do there's not another way for

188
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,810
plants to enter a market to come from a

189
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:48,239
non-legal market to a legal market there

190
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,949
had to be a way to get plants in so that

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,259
was the opportunity they gave us a short

192
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,029
time we were able to enter our genetics

193
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,469
if you had seeds there was a way to get

194
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,000
those seeds in the system if you had

195
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,980
clones there was a way to get your

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,199
clones into the system those became your

197
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,240
plants for the future so now there has

198
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,089
kind of been a door closed on the

199
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,819
opportunity to enter new genetics into a

200
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:11,069
medical or recreational recreational

201
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:15,089
that's a new word recreational cannabis

202
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:17,939
facility in Colorado now if you want to

203
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:20,879
introduce new genetics into your grow

204
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:23,730
they have to come from seeds which were

205
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,370
produced within your marijuana

206
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,740
Enforcement Division regulated facility

207
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,560
so you have to grow a plant and you have

208
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,779
to find seeds within that plant then

209
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,389
those seeds need to be entered into the

210
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,129
system as new seeds then you can

211
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,960
germinate the seeds then they become veg

212
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:41,729
plants there is a procedure that they

213
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,570
follow in the computer system to

214
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:48,060
document that process so in theory the

215
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,060
entry time for new genetics in the

216
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:53,639
facilities has been cut off unless those

217
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,509
genetics are produced within a facility

218
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,789
so

219
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:59,250
theory the only way to introduce new

220
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:02,009
genetics would be to breed inside of a

221
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,710
facility which is very costly and very

222
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:06,870
ineffective we need every gram of

223
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,610
profitable flour to come out of that

224
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,470
facility as possible so we are

225
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,169
struggling to produce all of the flour

226
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,519
we can we can't spend time making seeds

227
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:17,009
in one of our rooms

228
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,379
what oftentimes happens is during

229
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:21,419
harvest we may discover a handful of

230
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:22,590
seeds in one plant we may be chopping it

231
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,719
up and a bunch of seeds will go tink

232
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,610
tink tink and will go hey this whatever

233
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,139
plant over here plant number seven six

234
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,909
five three three just dropped out a

235
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,409
bunch of seeds and then you go to the

236
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:33,029
computer and you say plant number seven

237
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:35,579
six five three three dropped a bunch of

238
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,750
seeds you actually wave the seeds so you

239
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,670
can subtract that weight from your

240
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,470
harvest total you document how many

241
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:41,969
seeds there were which plant they come

242
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,920
from I already forgot the number seven

243
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,180
six five something [ __ ] whatever we

244
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,439
[ __ ] forgot what plant that came from

245
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,120
that happens a lot make up a number

246
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,440
that's what we do in the meed system I'm

247
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,659
just kidding you guys that never happens

248
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,590
we always do it by the book anyway find

249
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,909
out where those plants came from

250
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,800
document the number write it down

251
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:58,049
subtract the weight now you've got seeds

252
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,209
in the computer with a parent plant that

253
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:03,509
they came from the meed would like to

254
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,070
know the male and female oftentimes in a

255
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:06,120
grow environment who knows where they

256
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,490
came from if it's a commercial

257
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,200
environment it was probably a herm it is

258
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,480
not illegal I don't know if I want to

259
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,000
share this advice it is not illegal to

260
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,470
enter pollen into a commercial facility

261
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,690
if you own a facility if you're the

262
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,700
manager and you have got pollen you can

263
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,100
take your pollen and pollinate your grow

264
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,960
at your own disposal if that's what you

265
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,180
want to do that is not illegal the

266
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,860
pollen is not regulated by the marijuana

267
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,989
Enforcement Division so if you do want

268
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,970
to breed that is an option in a

269
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,310
commercial facility but that is where

270
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,820
the new genetics need to come from so

271
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:41,069
unless this facility acquired some of my

272
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,770
genetics a long time ago during that

273
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:46,680
window of opportunity they do not have I

274
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,449
region attic strains to work with now

275
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,879
before these rules were put in place

276
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,580
some facilities and some people were

277
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,309
able to acquire my seeds or my clones

278
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,290
and enter them into their system so at

279
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:00,419
some facilities there are I read

280
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:03,000
genetics plants in there grow I have

281
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,189
seen lemon Jeffrey in several facilities

282
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,080
I've seen the Kalonji I've seen the

283
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,529
Kabletown and I've seen the Grateful dog

284
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,139
and a couple of

285
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:13,539
but I really don't know where the plants

286
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:16,240
have gone we are able to transfer plant

287
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:18,549
from facility to facility once they are

288
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,159
in the system but I don't know who has

289
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:24,099
what and where they go what I do know is

290
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:27,370
that apothecary farms and Green Dot labs

291
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,920
do not have any I read genetics in their

292
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:32,379
stable at this time now one good thing

293
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,899
about the extract market in Colorado is

294
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:36,370
something known as a 50/50 deal this is

295
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:39,039
a little bit of a business talk here for

296
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,899
the Colorado concentrate market there

297
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,328
are a lot of different business

298
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,610
strategies available for a concentrate

299
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:48,969
company but a very common practice is

300
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,850
this hypothetically let's say you are an

301
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,528
extract company you are big dick gems

302
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,690
extract company you are making

303
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:57,789
concentrates your job is to make the

304
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,680
best concentrates for the dispensary

305
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:01,809
you've got to grow you grow your own

306
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,519
flowers and you process those you put

307
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:05,229
them on the shelf and you [ __ ] you've

308
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,820
got a vertical line you're growing

309
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,110
you're extracting you're putting it on

310
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,760
the shelf and you're making money

311
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,470
there's nobody else involved maybe

312
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,389
you've got your own store maybe it goes

313
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,160
to a different retail location either

314
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:16,750
way as long as you're growing extracting

315
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,269
and then selling the extract you were

316
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,909
making plenty of profits now at some

317
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:23,860
point your grow will slow down or you

318
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:26,198
will be between harvests and you won't

319
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,180
have anything to process now you're not

320
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:29,500
making any money you are only relying on

321
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,979
that retail product that has been

322
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,198
stocked on the Shelf that may run out a

323
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:39,039
great way for a concentrate company to

324
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:42,458
make extra income and broaden their menu

325
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,319
is what is known as a 50/50 deal let's

326
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:46,000
say that there is another grow

327
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,579
who wants concentrates but is not

328
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,440
attached to a concentrate company they

329
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:53,139
will take their flowers or their trim

330
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,690
material and give that material to the

331
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,669
extraction company that extraction

332
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,380
company will do their job of processing

333
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:02,289
your material into top-shelf

334
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:04,720
concentrates and they also package it

335
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:07,838
into individual grams that are properly

336
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,310
labeled for retail sale now once the

337
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,370
flowers are processed you have got a

338
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:13,088
bulk batch of processed concentrates in

339
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,600
retail

340
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:19,209
ready containers this is where a 50/50

341
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,860
deal quite often comes into play the

342
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:24,289
concentrate company needs to be paid

343
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,090
for their extraction work they did a lot

344
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,649
of work they did the processing they

345
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,750
trained employees to do it they used

346
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:32,090
equipment to do it they packaged it they

347
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,940
probably paid for the packaging so now

348
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:38,389
there is a fee owed to that extraction

349
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:41,360
company many times the grower will let

350
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:44,059
the extraction company keep 50% of the

351
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,669
finished product as their payment so if

352
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:48,889
that commercial facility gives big dick

353
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:51,049
Jim's extraction company so many grams

354
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,230
of cannabis they extract it and they

355
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:56,029
turn it into 100 finished prepackaged

356
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,850
grams of cannabis and they have reached

357
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:00,709
a 50/50 deal that means that the grow

358
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,009
and the extraction company each leave

359
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,810
with 50 grams of concentrate now that

360
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,939
grow gets to put that concentrate on

361
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:09,500
whatever retail shelf they want they've

362
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,420
got money to be made they've got a

363
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,669
product they can sell that the

364
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:16,399
concentrate company in turn puts those

365
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:18,469
concentrates on their shelves they have

366
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,389
just doubled their inventory and

367
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,430
hopefully in that process they've added

368
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:24,889
some new flavors and added some variety

369
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:27,199
to their menu so that is a 50-50 deal

370
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,990
they run the product then they split it

371
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,100
50/50 with the grower the grower sells

372
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,570
it however they want if they're

373
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,149
retailing it's got to stay legal this

374
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,890
all stays in the legal market then the

375
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,809
extraction company puts it on better

376
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,090
shelf and they sell it at their store

377
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:42,649
that is how they get paid on their end

378
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,290
another thing that can happen sometimes

379
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,699
is the original grower will buy back the

380
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:48,439
product if they run it they've got a

381
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,090
hundred grands at the end they sell it

382
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,040
back to them at a premium price which is

383
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,230
pre agreed upon before the extraction is

384
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,879
run so they run the material then the

385
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,649
grower actually buys it all back from

386
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,090
them then they send it to their retail

387
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:01,129
location and they can put it on their

388
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,530
retail store or they can spread it out

389
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:05,210
to other retail locations maybe they've

390
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,649
got multiple stores they want to spread

391
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,210
it out to different stores maybe they've

392
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,500
got a wholesale deal lined up to where

393
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,730
they already have a customer that wants

394
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,100
to buy a bunch of it and then they can

395
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,710
put that on their shelves but in most

396
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,389
cases it is either a 50/50 deal where

397
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,730
the extraction company ends up with half

398
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:21,740
of the final product and the grower or

399
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,269
the facility ends up with the other half

400
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,430
of the final product and that gets

401
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,649
transferred to a retail store or it is a

402
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:29,359
buyback deal where the grow sends the

403
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:30,740
material and then they run it and they

404
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,419
say there's a hundred grams we'll sell

405
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,129
it back to you with this much they buy

406
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:35,689
it back then they put it on the retail

407
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:37,220
shelf and they mark it up

408
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,710
quite liberally that is where the money

409
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,440
is made in the concentrates so that is

410
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,000
the long explanation of why when you

411
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,250
hear me talking about what I am dabbing

412
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,960
on the podcast it is rarely an eye

413
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,049
region attic strain because most of my

414
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,269
stuff is not in the Colorado marijuana

415
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,129
Enforcement Division system a few

416
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:57,049
facilities do have it but you have to

417
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:59,509
find a facility that has got the plant

418
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:01,399
who is also ran the extraction who also

419
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:05,059
has it on the Shelf available in my area

420
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:08,360
for a desirable price those are a lot of

421
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:10,039
variables to hit sometimes elevations in

422
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,769
Colorado Springs will have some

423
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:15,169
wonderful lemon Jeffrey concentrates but

424
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:17,090
they also let different concentrate

425
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:19,250
makers make the product they let

426
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,019
different companies run the material so

427
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,389
the product comes out differently

428
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:25,610
through each processor some of those

429
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:27,919
processors I approve of some of them I

430
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,750
will not buy their product so sometimes

431
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,059
they may have lemon Jeffrey concentrates

432
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,679
on the shelf and I still might pass on

433
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,329
it so that is part of why I'm not

434
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,429
smoking my own concentrates there is

435
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,470
another little branch to this question

436
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,209
you see me growing a lot of flowers on

437
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,879
social media I post a lot of pictures of

438
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:46,970
quality flowers I am a breeder most of

439
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:49,610
what I am growing is loaded with seeds

440
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,460
most of the seeded plants do not make

441
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,200
quality hash material that is so beat up

442
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,240
by the time I take the seeds out of it

443
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,340
that it is a waste of time for a

444
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,049
concentrate maker a concentrate maker

445
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,730
could have ran quality product and had

446
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:04,159
much better results they don't want to

447
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,588
waste their time on my beat up seeded

448
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,240
material so I don't have that made into

449
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:10,279
concentrates that is usually given to

450
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,509
friends and they turn it into edibles

451
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,939
because they do it with their own small

452
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:15,920
personal time their personal kitchen

453
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,750
we're not using a lot of big space we're

454
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,519
not wasting a lot of time not wasting

455
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,410
anybody's energy so I give it away to

456
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,910
people and they make edibles out of it

457
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,519
that is what happens to the material

458
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,620
from the seeded plants now when you do

459
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,480
see me doing phenyl hunts of my new seed

460
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,739
runs because once I breed seeds the next

461
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,210
step is to grow them and see what I have

462
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,880
created that's part of the fun that's

463
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,430
one of my favorite parts those buds are

464
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,980
finished they are not seated most of the

465
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,259
time I take those buds with me to events

466
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,640
like the Indo Expo or the dude grow show

467
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:46,039
or whatever

468
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,780
vending event or community event or

469
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:49,399
social event may be happening this week

470
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:51,049
I took a bunch of

471
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,670
to the Phish concerts I did not bring

472
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:55,490
any of the cannabis I took with me back

473
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,900
we smoked every single bud so that is

474
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,640
what happens to most of the flower I

475
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,680
grow I take it to events I take it to

476
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,420
concerts I smoke and share it with my

477
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,710
friends if you show up in my house and

478
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,420
you're like I haven't had weed in a

479
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,279
couple of days we'll make sure you leave

480
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,130
here with a couple of buds and stoned as

481
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,529
[ __ ] so that's what happens to my flower

482
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,540
you see all those pictures of seeded

483
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:16,579
plants all that finger-banged material

484
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:18,980
gets given away people make edibles out

485
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:21,049
of it then those buds you see from the

486
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,000
pheno hunt runs those nice photogenic

487
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:25,669
buds I smoked those with all of my

488
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,500
friends at the events I had multiple

489
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,779
jars on the table at the dude grows cup

490
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,339
I had multiple jars on the table at the

491
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,589
concentration celebration

492
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:36,409
I had several jars on the table at the

493
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:38,179
endo Expo I smoked all of that cannabis

494
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,620
with all of my friends so that's what

495
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,390
happens to all of that material

496
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,769
all right podcast rule that got really

497
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,810
carried away that took much longer than

498
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:46,069
I had anticipated so we're going to jump

499
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:48,500
right to the next bullet point really

500
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:50,569
quickly no more testers is my next

501
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,339
bullet point recently on the podcast I

502
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:56,419
mentioned that I need some people to

503
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:59,209
test a few new seeds for me um thank you

504
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:02,360

505
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,759
gotten more emails and please stop I

506
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,829
found enough testers I may have read

507
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:08,629
your email and not replied yet because I

508
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:10,189

509
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,500
through them and looking for my

510
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,480

514
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,690

about and then we're going to wrap up

603
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:35,609
this episode I recently did an episode

604
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,950
talking about dab pens and smoking

605
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:39,959
concentrates we got into that

606
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,019
conversation again on the embracing

607
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,360
organics podcast live on YouTube where I

608
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:47,099
was asked the question how do you

609
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,158
politely decline

610
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:53,069
somebody's dab pen or questionable

611
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,830
concentrate being in my position in the

612
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:58,710
cannabis community many people want to

613
00:22:55,829 --> 00:23:01,470
smoke with me many people want to dab me

614
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,509
out a lot of people want to find me at

615
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,288
an event and come to my booth and give

616
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:06,569
me a DAB

617
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:08,069
just to show that they love me that

618
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:09,808
they're my friend they want to share

619
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:11,399
their concentrate with me they want to

620
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:13,558
show some respect and they also just

621
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,140
want to say I dabbed with Rasta Jeff I

622
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:19,740
understand that I respect that and I

623
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:23,538
appreciate it but sometimes those people

624
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:26,190
show up with the scariest questionable

625
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:29,908
concentrates that I do not want to

626
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:32,669
consume I also want to be polite I also

627
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:35,039
want to remain friends with everybody I

628
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:37,620
also don't want to belittle anybody's

629
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,509
product maybe they made that concentrate

630
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,819
themselves maybe they grew the flower

631
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:43,980
maybe they're extremely proud of it and

632
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:46,379
I don't want to be the person who tells

633
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,929
them that is doodoo and I do not approve

634
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,960
so somebody politely said what is the

635
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:54,240
best way around that situation and I'll

636
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,370
tell you how I handle it if you approach

637
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,829
me and you have got some dabs then I'm

638
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:00,298
not really sure I want a dab I'm going

639
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:01,769

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,019
I'm gonna let you tell me about your

659
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,220
girl

660
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,990
I'm gonna open the lid I'm gonna scoop

661
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,549
up a pretty good dad and while you're

662
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,859
talking I'm gonna heat up the dab nail

663
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:39,480
and then when the dab nail is the

664
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:41,309
appropriate he I'm gonna hand you the

665
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,110
dabber and give you the day break and go

666
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:44,609
hey man take a dab of this green dot and

667
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:46,979
you're gonna take a dab and you're gonna

668
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:48,809
go I'm [ __ ] stoned and then you're

669
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,490
gonna forget you even offered me a dab

670
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,349
of your questionable concentrates and

671
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,670
I'm out of it don't have to worry about

672
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:56,159
it you're stoned

673
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:57,990
I'm already stoned if you keep pressing

674
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,279
I may go oh man I'm gonna try some of

675
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,049
this and then I'm just gonna take a dab

676
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,660
of mine and then act like I forgot to

677
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:05,519
dab yours so the best way to kind of

678
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,050
switch it up and get out of dabbing a

679
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,359
questionable concentrate is to pull out

680
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:11,909
yours and politely offer that person

681
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,369
some of your concentrate and flip the

682
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,580
script switch it up be a Salesman

683
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:18,959
keep talking don't stop keep moving

684
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:20,639
overwhelming their thoughts reprogram

685
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,500
them that they want a dab of your [ __ ]

686
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,290
and they'll forget so that is how I get

687
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,970
around it I am kind of afraid to take

688
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:29,670
concentrates from other people

689
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:32,339
I am absolutely afraid to hit a vape pen

690
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:35,370
or a dab pen from a company I am not

691
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:37,409
familiar with so in the future if you

692
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:39,239
offer me a concentrate or a vape or

693
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,850
maybe even flowers and I politely

694
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,130
decline it has nothing to do with you it

695
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:47,009
has everything to do with popcorn lung

696
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,410
and me not trusting other companies and

697
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:51,359
other makers I have to be careful we all

698
