27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
you know i like to start this podcast

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:06,239
off by talking about what i'm smoking

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,320
today i've been taking dabs of reba jam

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,679
live batter from green dot labs

31
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,359
this is a blend of jelly 13 and i-95

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,759
on the package the flavor is described

33
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,599
as tangerine and sour fuel

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,359
i think i completely agree with that

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,519
when i crack open the jar i am greeted

36
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,000
by a sweet tangerine aroma

37
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,640
and that is followed by a funky sour

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,560
fuel

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,000
when i take dabs of it i definitely

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,920
taste that sour fuel

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,438
if i dab it nice and cool the orange

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,799
flavor and aroma comes in a little bit

43
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,839
more if i go too hot

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,200
it is definitely sour and funky on the

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,799
back of the package it says the

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,600
product does contain 64.08 thc

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,799

but about safety this is where the

139
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,079
message gets interesting it says

140
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,400
last night after putting our two kids to

141
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,478
bed my wife came downstairs and found

142
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,359
water running all the way down into our

143
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,879
living room

144
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
we just bought this house last year and

145
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,199
we have done a lot of work on it

146
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,879
including new

147
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,400
laminate flooring which was water

148
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,079
resistant thankfully

149
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,519
and i was completely horrified to come

150
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,000
downstairs and see

151
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,959
water everywhere that's got to be a

152
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
scary sight

153
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,638
says i ran to our basement to grab the

154
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
shop vac and there were waterfalls

155
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,079
coming from the ceiling

156
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,759
uh that made me feel a certain way when

157
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,359
you said that my stomach moved i got a

158
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,080
little drop in my gut my chest felt

159
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
tight

160
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,599
waterfalls coming from the ceiling is

161
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,159
never a good thing unless you paid extra

162
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
for that

163
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,680
it is 99 of the time a major [ __ ]

164
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,840
problem

165
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,120
um horrified isn't even a strong enough

166
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,879
word i agree with you

167
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
i'm feeling panic inside right now and

168
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,439
it's not even my house or my grow

169
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,038
it says sure panic took over and i ran

170
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,120
to the grow room to find it

171
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,719
completely dry and the flooding water

172
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
hadn't crept that far

173
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
i had a bit of water from another part

174
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,840
but it was very little

175
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,360
thankfully sounds like this could have

176
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,719
been much worse and i'm really glad it

177
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,479
wasn't too bad for you

178
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,400
it goes on to say i had just revamped

179
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,680
the grow last month which included

180
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,918
switching out lights

181
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
caulking and sealing every everything

182
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,439
super tight

183
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,600
and we repainted i was also very mindful

184
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,240
to place all cords and electronics up

185
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
high

186
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,439
that is a good step i talked about that

187
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,479
in a previous episode but we'll get

188
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,399
there in a minute

189
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,599
uh hanging the electronics or hanging

190
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,758
from hooks or sitting

191
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
on a tall shelf and i can say that the

192
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,160
likelihood of doing that on my own is

193
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,758
slim so without your knowledge without

194
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
your podcast and without

195
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,879
uh you're talking about how important

196
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,318
safety is in the grow room

197
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,159
i can't say i would have given the

198
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,879
safety much thought if

199
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,639
any the sound this sounds asinine and

200
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,159
kind of crazy we have the chords and

201
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
[ __ ] all over sometimes

202
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,840
which i've gone around and placed on top

203
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,840
of tables and desks and off the floor

204
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,119
we'll never have them on the floor again

205
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,799
thanks to you

206
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,639
uh you sound you seem like a [ __ ]

207
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
stand-up guy and i hope to get to meet

208
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,720
you

209
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,038
and give you a hug at some point next

210
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
year i hope when all this quarantine and

211
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,079
weirdness goes away that i get to meet a

212
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,918
lot of people and get a lot of hugs

213
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,599
i look forward to it it says sorry for

214
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,719
this long ass email but i thought you'd

215
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
enjoy this story

216
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,960
i mean it's crazy right yes it is crazy

217
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,440
so crazy that it has inspired

218
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,879
a redo of the grow room safety episode

219
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,478
it says anyway take care

220
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,879
stay safe as hell during this crazy

221
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,599
pandemic attached as a video i did watch

222
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,519
that video

223
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
i gave me a panic attack there was just

224
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,719
water falling from this person's ceiling

225
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,359
lots of water everywhere in places it

226
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
shouldn't be

227
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
i see exactly what you're talking about

228
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,598
so they wrap it up and it says from

229
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
brandy

230
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,879
now that has inspired a grow room safety

231
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,400
lesson the reason brandy was smart

232
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,079
enough and aware to keep their

233
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,839
electronics up off the floors because i

234
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,199
did an episode in the past but we are

235
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,598
now on a video format

236
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,400
so it's time to do a refresher of the

237
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,759
grow room

238
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,799
safety course let's talk about basic

239
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,000
safety

240
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,680
there are a lot of things we can hurt

241
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,279
ourselves potentially make ourselves

242
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,519
sick with in a grow room

243
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,119
always think about personal protective

244
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,719
equipment that is the first place to

245
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,478
start before you go in there

246
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,000
do you have the right stuff on are you

247
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,879
wearing the right [ __ ] you should have

248
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,079
gloves on

249
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,279
i know you're just going in there look

250
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,719
at the plants but if you're going to

251
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,359
touch a plant if you're going to touch a

252
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,919
bottle

253
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
put on some gloves a six millimeter or

254
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,198
thicker

255
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,318
nitrile gloves are what i recommend wear

256
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,520
gloves

257
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
you probably i don't know what you're

258
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,000
doing in your grow but possibly you have

259
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,759
applied a pesticide to those plants

260
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,279
when you sprayed that pesticide it

261
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,720
didn't just hit the plants it hit the

262
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,519
walls it hit the ceiling and hit the

263
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,680
doorknobs

264
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,799
it hit everywhere in that room so now

265
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,759
you're going to go in there and touch

266
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
[ __ ] in that room

267
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,960
you're going to pick up pesticides off

268
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,000
the walls you're going to get pesticides

269
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,598
off the doorknob

270
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
they're probably pesticides in places

271
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,159
you didn't think about don't get that on

272
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,680
your hands

273
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,960
then it's your face then you're gonna

274
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,160
get a big rash on your face you're gonna

275
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,758
look like a [ __ ] freak

276
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,680
don't do that to yourself wear

277
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,439
protective gloves in the grow

278
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,800
another thing to think about don't touch

279
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,240
your face if you're

280
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,439
if you've got the gloves on don't hit

281
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,120
your face with those gloves on if your

282
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,399
face hitches take the gloves off scratch

283
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,840
your face get new gloves

284
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,159
let's not contaminate ourselves with

285
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,119
pesticides also in a previous episode we

286
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,039
heard about a listener

287
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,319
who gets rashes just from coming in

288
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,719
contact with the plants

289
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,720
so wear gloves let's not give ourselves

290
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
any rashes from the plants themselves or

291
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,440
the pesticides

292
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,879
or any other foliar feeds we may have

293
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,839
applied to the grow

294
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,000
along with rubber gloves i recommend

295
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
long sleeves in a grow environment

296
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,958
i know it's hot in there it's not the

297
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,679
perfect environment for wearing long

298
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,518
sleeves

299
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,120
but you don't want to get that pesticide

300
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,560
on your arms like i talked about a

301
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,399
moment ago we had a listener

302
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,399
who got a rash just from touching the

303
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,159
plants you're wearing long sleeves

304
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,519
that's not an option so wear long

305
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,519
sleeves it can be something real

306
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,039
thin if you just got like a light like a

307
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
light little linen just a button-down

308
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,838
shirt to put on you still look nice you

309
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,278
look good in there and you're protecting

310
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,760
your arms if you're a hoodie guy wear a

311
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,360
hoodie

312
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,200
if you're a long-sleeve shirt guy wear a

313
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,800
long sleeve shirt if you're a guy or a

314
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
gal that doesn't want to cover up your

315
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,639
sleeves

316
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
you can run that risk of getting a

317
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,600
pesticide on your arm you can run the

318
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
risk of getting the rash

319
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
but i highly recommend gloves and long

320
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,799
sleeves

321
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,399
hopefully you're wearing pants a lot of

322
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,879
the times i see people wearing shorts in

323
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,799
the grow

324
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,559
i guess that's acceptable unless you're

325
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,278
spraying a pesticide if you are applying

326
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,119
something be

327
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,559
completely covered i know it's hot in

328
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,000
there we got our arms covered up

329
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,838
it's less likely that our legs are going

330
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,240
to brush up against plants but if they

331
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,200
do

332
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,480
i recommend you wear pants also always

333
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,519
have good

334
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
shoes i know shoes a lot of us

335
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,959
want to be barefoot and grow a lot of us

336
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
want to run around and feel the dirt

337
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,239
that's cool if that's your girl if

338
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,480
that's what you want to do go for that

339
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,680
i highly recommend shoes for several

340
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
reasons

341
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,879
first of all let's think about

342
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,518
pesticides if you are in an indoor

343
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,120
environment

344
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,879
and you have applied a pesticide where

345
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,080
does it all land anything that dripped

346
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,958
off the plants anything that wasn't

347
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,200
caught in the air

348
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,639
is on the floor if you were barefoot you

349
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
were rubbing your bare feet

350
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,319
on that pesticide laden floor unless you

351
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,599
have mops since the pesticides but if

352
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,040
you're in there barefoot

353
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,320
i'm imagining you're not a mopping kind

354
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,439
of person as well you're barefoot in

355
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,120
that dirty grow room

356
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,120
collecting pesticides on the bottoms of

357
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,959
your feet the bottoms of your feet are

358
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,440
one of the most absorbent parts of your

359
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,759
body

360
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,040
if you want to get a pesticide toxicity

361
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,958
just pour it onto the bottoms of your

362
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,919
feet it'll absorb really quickly it's a

363
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,159
good way to get yourself

364
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,000
sick so i recommend shoes in there to

365
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,120
keep yourself away from the pesticides

366
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,958
that could be on the floor

367
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,879
also anything else you may have spilled

368
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,039
a nutrient a nutrient bottle

369
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,078
a nutrient solution that's on the floor

370
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,759
getting into your feet

371
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,919
can't be good for you also not good for

372
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,600
your skin i get it i used to be a major

373
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,639
hippie too when i was younger now i wear

374
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,240
shoes in the grow

375
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,679
what if you drop something on your feet

376
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,000
that's gonna suck you're out of work for

377
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,519
a day

378
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,440
or two you don't want that to happen

379
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,639
just wear some shoes is my advice if

380
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,640
you're in a commercial grow

381
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,078
you better be wearing closed-toed shoes

382
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,838
if you show up to my commercial girl in

383
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,120
flip-flops or sandals guess what

384
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,480
better go to the car and find some good

385
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,360
shoes or go home and get some good ones

386
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,399
because you're not wearing that [ __ ] in

387
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,919
my commercial grow

388
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,078
protect yourselves you guys also wear

389
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,120
if you're around any sort of sprays if

390
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,199
you are mixing

391
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,039
pesticides if you're mixing nutrients i

392
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,399
recommend some sort of goggles i know

393
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,199
that sounds excessive

394
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,679
but your eyes are the most sensitive

395
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
organ

396
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,679
in your body that are exposed to the

397
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
outside elements i can poke you anywhere

398
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,919
on the chest and the arms you're going

399
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,838
to be cool but if i get right in your

400
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,000
eye one time it [ __ ] sucks dude

401
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,200
protect your eyes wear some goggles wear

402
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,958
something over your eyes when you're

403
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,480
mixing and spraying

404
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,559
anytime if you're going to reach for a

405
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,240
pesticide or a nutrient bottle

406
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,399
right before you reach for that put on

407
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,079
gloves and goggles it's really easy

408
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,078
especially in a commercial environment a

409
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,838
lot of times if i see you not using the

410
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,278
appropriate personal protective

411
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,640
equipment in a commercial grow

412
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:45,919
you get to take a little break you get

413
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,439
to come up to the office and hang out

414
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,199
with me while i write out a report

415
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
on how you are failing to wear the

416
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,079
products that i have assigned

417
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,599
keep yourself safe you guys this isn't

418
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,039
just because it looks cool

419
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,800
it's not just because we're nerdy we

420
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,599
want you to be safe

421
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,359
and healthy i have a friend who was

422
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,560
mixing nutrients by himself

423
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,079
and he got ph down in his eye

424
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,919
he wasn't wearing goggles he wasn't

425
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,759
wearing gloves you got ph down oh you

426
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,958
got phd on his hand and rubbed it into

427
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,639
his eye is what he did

428
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,239
so he got it from his skin into his eye

429
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,039
now he's got ph down on his hand it's

430
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,639
burning his hand

431
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,159
now he's also got it in his eye he

432
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,720
didn't know what to do you know what he

433
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,278
had to do

434
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,360
he pulled out his phone and used siri to

435
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,600
call

436
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
to his 911 room to come help him out

437
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,800
imagine being in that situation you

438
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,078
don't want the cops the paramedics

439
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,838
showing up at your grow

440
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,679
unless it's completely legal that could

441
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,120
be terrible so everything i'm talking

442
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,319
about has a purpose i'm not just coming

443
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,839
out here trying to be dad

444
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,040
i know i'm getting older but that's not

445
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,079
what this is about this is because i

446
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,519
care about you guys

447
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,359
and you may not have thought about this

448
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,200
so i'm trying to give you a reminder

449
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,560
and give you examples of why you might

450
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,120
want to use the equipment i'm talking

451
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,278
about

452
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,039
uh gloves long sleeves good shoes that

453
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,879
should all be self-explanatory

454
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,240
goggles that should be self-explanatory

455
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,679
like i said your eyes are sensitive i

456
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
can poke you anywhere else on your body

457
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,319
but the minute i touch your eyeball you

458
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
[ __ ] want to run away and take a

459
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,480
minute

460
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,079
all right another thing i want to make

461
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,879
sure to talk about is selecting the

462
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,039
appropriate

463
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,000
mask or respirator when applying a

464
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,919
pesticide

465
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,440
a lot of times i see guys wearing gloves

466
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,639
and long sleeves and they got the

467
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,240
goggles on when they're spraying a

468
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,560
pesticide but they have forgotten

469
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,639
to use some sort of a mask or respirator

470
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,319
over their face to protect themselves

471
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,159
when you're spraying a pesticide you're

472
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,800
making bubbles you're making a mist in

473
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,879
the room

474
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,078
and then you're breathing you're just

475
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,838
sucking up all that mist

476
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,679
all those bubbles you are pesticiding

477
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,279
yourself you're applying pesticides to

478
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,799
your lungs if you're not wearing the

479
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,600
appropriate respirator

480
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,479
so i highly recommend the appropriate

481
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,360
respirator

482
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,800
for pesticide applications especially if

483
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,800
you were using something like a paint

484
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,240
sprayer to make really small bubbles if

485
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,958
you're using a fogger

486
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,079
definitely definitely you need a mask or

487
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,239
a respirator

488
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,439
on the inside of your pesticides uh not

489
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,039
on the inside on the

490
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,639
outside of the pesticide bottle there is

491
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,240
a book if you open that book

492
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,240
it will tell you what personal

493
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,639
protective equipment you need to wear

494
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,320
while applying that pesticide wear all

495
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,039
of that stuff if it says minimum

496
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,879
requirement

497
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,278
that is the minimum requirement you can

498
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,958
do more but don't do less than that

499
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,240
also there is what is known as the

500
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:13,119
re-entry interval printed on that bottle

501
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,039
the rei tells you how long you need to

502
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,000
stay out of that grow room without

503
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,000
personal protective

504
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,519
equipment before you re-enter after

505
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,240
applying that pesticide

506
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,679
so if the rei is four hours you go in

507
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,680
there with your equipment you spray you

508
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,919
come out you set a timer for four hours

509
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,599
if it's a commercial grow put a sign on

510
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,240
the door that says hey i sprayed in here

511
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
at noon

512
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,120
don't go back in here until four o'clock

513
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
there are signs that are already

514
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
pre-made

515
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,720
from the department of agriculture they

516
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,360
will give them to you they will sell

517
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,040
them to you

518
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,639
put those signs on your doors to let

519
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,120
people know don't go in here

520
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,959
i sprayed this room you will get sick

521
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,679
then here's something to think about

522
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,399
if you are applying pesticides indoors

523
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,759
increase

524
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,440
the rei by a minimum of two to four

525
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,360
hours the rei the re-entry interval

526
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,199
was designed for a greenhouse or an

527
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,959
outdoor application they did not think

528
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,519
we were going to apply these pesticides

529
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,039
indoors indoors we don't have the sun

530
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,560
breaking down the pesticides we don't

531
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,278
have as much air movement we don't have

532
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,198
wind

533
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,120
it's not as open and free you were

534
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:11,519
trapped in that stagnant box of a grow

535
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,839
room

536
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,399
so please allow an extra two to four

537
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,000
hours for a re-entry interval after a

538
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,078
pesticide in a small

539
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,679
in a grow room indoors not just a small

540
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,919
in a big room indoors

541
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,759
let that pesticide break down let that

542
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,599
cloud of fog spray go away

543
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,679
don't put yourself in danger give

544
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,959
yourself that extra re-entry

545
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,758
interval also write down

546
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,758
every pesticide application if you're in

547
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,159
a commercial grow you are required

548
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,919
to keep a pesticide log if you were in a

549
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:45,120
personal grow i recommend

550
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,559
keeping a pesticide log write down every

551
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,480
pesticide you sprayed

552
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,239
the date you sprayed it the amount you

553
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,399
put in the mix when you mixed it up

554
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,278
and which plants you sprayed it on so

555
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,399
it'll say like

556
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,240
tuesday this is the date i applied these

557
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,039
pesticides at this much

558
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,639
on these plants at this time then we

559
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,439
have a good documentation of when you

560
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,360
applied things

561
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,639
you know when you sprayed last right now

562
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
if i say hey when did you spray for

563
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,079
spider mites last

564
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
do you know write that [ __ ] down then

565
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,559
you know

566
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,839
that within three to five days it is

567
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,838
time to treat again

568
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,680
so i don't get an infestation and if i

569
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,279
do have an infestation i need to stay on

570
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,758
top of a tight schedule

571
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,320
so pesticide logs are very important

572
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,159
also

573
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,079
in the future if you get some sort of a

574
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,600
rash that could be a pesticide outbreak

575
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,758
or a pesticide exposure

576
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,120
we know that you sprayed this pesticide

577
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,159
on these plants on this day because here

578
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,519
it is you wrote it down

579
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,278
you can help yourself out you can help

580
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,198
the doctor out if you do get sick

581
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,399
just help yourself out set yourself up

582
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,479
for success

583
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,240
so pesticide logs are very important

584
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,600
also i recommend having

585
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,360
if you're in a commercial grow this is

586
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,639
required but i recommend having

587
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,680
msds sheets for almost every product you

588
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,839
use

589
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,198
especially pesticides especially foliar

590
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,279
feeds then

591
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,879
also have them for all of your nutrients

592
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,120
anything that comes into that grow

593
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,360
just print off an msds sheet put it in a

594
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
folder next to your pesticide logs that

595
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,439
way any information that we need

596
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,439
we've got available if something does go

597
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,279
wrong we've got all the information we

598
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,519
need i hope nothing goes wrong

599
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,759
but if you get a rash if you get a weird

600
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,199
disease we can look at all of your msds

601
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,558
sheets and say oh he's using this

602
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,519
product and this product oh here's the

603
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,160
one right here that's giving him

604
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,599
seizures

605
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,038
maybe we can figure something out i

606
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
don't want that to happen to you but if

607
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,919
it does happen

608
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,838
all of that documentation will help us

609
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,038
out accountability will really help you

610
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,798
out in the future

611
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,480
and if you are keeping all of these

612
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,240
documents in your personal grow

613
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,759
when it comes time to expand into

614
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,279
commercial growing you're already

615
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,798
working with the practice it's already

616
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,879
something you're programmed to do

617
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,480
and it's not a big whole new step it's

618
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,919
not a whole bunch of new [ __ ] to learn

619
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,599
so pesticide logs and msds sheets can be

620
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,960
invaluable have those around in your

621
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,159
grow now

622
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,840
i just thought of if you're in an

623
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,240
illegal area if you're in prohibition

624
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,839
land

625
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,440
that's like evidence maybe you don't

626
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,879
want all that [ __ ] maybe keep that as a

627
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,038
google doc and maybe have a couple of

628
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,799
passwords so nobody can access that

629
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,558
but if you're in a legal area and you

630
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,119
were growing i would have

631
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,000
msds sheets and pesticide logs just as

632
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,239
accountability

633
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,919
and they work well in the future for if

634
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
you want to do some sort of applying for

635
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,440
jobs you could say i've already been

636
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,199
keeping pesticide logs and msds sheets

637
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,038
and also understand your local

638
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,360
department of agriculture rules

639
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,079
so i think that gets us through most of

640
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,439
that part

641
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,960
always read the labels on your

642
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
pesticides there's another note that i

643
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,038
wrote

644
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,879
that little book on the front of the

645
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,319
pesticide pops open and there are so

646
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,960
many details in there

647
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,000
reentry interval um what to look for for

648
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,360
exposure

649
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,798
how much to apply when to apply it uh

650
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,359
what personal protective equipment to

651
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,519
use if it is toxic if it's dangerous

652
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,639
uh if it's it's got all that is labeled

653
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,319
on there check that out

654
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,160
i recommend you look at that the little

655
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,038
booklet that pops out there's a lot of

656
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,400
good info in there

657
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,640
read it if you never have i highly

658
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,320
recommend that so that covers basically

659
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,360
like pesticide safety

660
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,839
and uh yeah pesticide safety application

661
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,759
safety

662
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,119
the basics of growing now let's work on

663
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,000
grow safety

664
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,199
a little bit uh when you're in the grow

665
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,240
there are a lot of things you can hurt

666
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,480
yourself with

667
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,599
um a lot of things i see that drive me

668
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,679
crazy are sticks

669
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,678
i do it in my grow too but those big

670
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,880
sticks if they're not tall enough if

671
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,919
they're too tall the ones that are like

672
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,840
four feet tall

673
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,360
i see a lot of people potentially poking

674
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,159
their eyes on those i have almost done

675
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,599
it myself

676
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,038
so you've got a plant it's starting to

677
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,399
droop on one side you put a couple of

678
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,679
sticks in there you put a zip tie around

679
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
it now your plants stand up you got a

680
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,120
stick on it everything is cool right

681
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,558
but tomorrow when you go to water that

682
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,678
plant or maybe you're just going to look

683
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,279
at the plant you lean over

684
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,960
you forget there's a stick in there that

685
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,399
stick goes right in your [ __ ] eye

686
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
those things are dangerous if you're

687
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,160
going to put sticks in the grow room

688
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,079
steaks bamboo sticks put something at

689
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,679
the end of that make it a flag or put a

690
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,159
tennis ball or a ping pong ball at the

691
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,320
end of it

692
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,440
to where it's not so pokey and it's not

693
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,119
such a high

694
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,960
danger those things will poke you right

695
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,239
in the eye that'll [ __ ] you up

696
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,558
another thing people seem to forget that

697
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,000
scissors are sharp when you're in the

698
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,119
grow room when you're in the trim room

699
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,119
you're hauling ass

700
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,879
pay attention because those fiskars are

701
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,479
[ __ ] sharp i've seen a lot of people

702
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,720
cut themselves i've seen people cut

703
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,640
other people pay attention you guys be

704
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,880
safe i shouldn't have to remind you

705
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,840
scissors are sharp don't leave them in

706
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,600
random places

707
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,879
don't put them in your pocket if you're

708
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,399
going to carry scissors around

709
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,679
use the little scissor holster that they

710
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,880
come with all the scissors come with a

711
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,880
little protective thing

712
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,159
use that [ __ ] put it on your belt if you

713
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
insist on putting the scissors in your

714
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,159
pocket

715
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
put them in that little sheath then put

716
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,280
them in your pocket be careful you guys

717
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,480
i don't want to have to write an

718
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,759
incident report on you because you were

719
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,599
just being dumb

720
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,879
scissors are sharp i know it's done that

721
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,480
i have to remind you but some people

722
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,520
need that [ __ ] reminder

723
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,558
also grow lights are hot as [ __ ]

724
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,158
those bulbs are hot don't touch those um

725
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,000
when it comes time to change a grow

726
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,640
light you can't just unscrew it and put

727
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,919
a new one in

728
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,200
it needs a little bit to cool off

729
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,320
depending on the size of the bulb and

730
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,640
how long it's been running

731
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,678
that thing is probably [ __ ] hot dude

732
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,200
don't touch it

733
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,440
remember grow lights are hot when

734
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,120
they're turned on also

735
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,480
blowers and extraction fans will eat

736
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,918
your [ __ ] fingers don't

737
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,839
think that you're just gonna move it or

738
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,520
adjust it a blower something like that

739
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,959
turn it off unplug it if you have to

740
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,000
adjust the ducting if you're gonna move

741
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,079
an extraction fan

742
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,440
i've cut my finger really badly on a

743
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,639
squirrel cage fan i'm showing it to the

744
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,759
camera i don't know if you can see that

745
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,600
scar on camera

746
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,798
i almost took the tip of that finger off

747
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,158
that is why it is not shaped

748
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,400
appropriately

749
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
i messed myself up really badly on a

750
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,480
blower i was

751
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,320
doing work on a ceiling area of a grow

752
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,919
and the ceiling one of the supports came

753
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,200
in and the blower kind of turned and my

754
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,000
finger went right into the opening of

755
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,558
the blower

756
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,839
and the tip of it is gone somewhere it

757
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,678
shred into little pieces

758
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,359
there were 13 stitches in my finger it

759
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,038
hurts right now just thinking about it

760
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:36,158
be [ __ ] careful those blowers are

761
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,720
dangerous uh where else are we fans

762
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,039
there are fans everywhere in grow rooms

763
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,679
in personal grows and commercial grows

764
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,759
those fans can be extremely dangerous

765
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,360
i've got dreadlocks to my knees

766
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,879
if you're in a grow room tie up your

767
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,038
dreadlocks if you've got a ponytail

768
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,400
stick it in your shirt those fans will

769
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,640
cause you problems

770
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,320
also in a commercial grow environment we

771
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,720
are required to have a

772
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,519
badge on us at all times that is visible

773
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,919
it's got to be

774
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,440
uh above the waist and below the neck

775
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,880
and it's got to be visible by the camera

776
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,240
so that if anybody looks at the camera

777
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,280
they can say that guy belongs there he's

778
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,279
got a badge

779
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,279
many of us wear the badge on a lanyard

780
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,839
around our necks

781
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,000
in colorado it is required that that

782
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,199
lanyard be a breakaway lanyard which

783
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
means in the middle of it it's got a

784
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,440
little section

785
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,440
that if i pull hard enough it just

786
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,679
breaks it doesn't have the potential or

787
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,798
the opportunity to wrap around my neck

788
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,200
and strangle me

789
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,440
if it becomes tied in a fan or a blower

790
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,600
so if you're wearing a lanyard in a grow

791
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,440
and you've got fans around you don't get

792
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,798
that lanyard caught in something and get

793
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,558
yourself [ __ ] hung

794
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,798
also if you're working with a trim

795
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,759
machine or a trim reaper or something

796
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,679
that's in front of you

797
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,798
don't lean over and stick your lanyard

798
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,640
into the trim machine

799
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,240
i've seen it done i've seen the lanyard

800
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,799
get stuck in the wood chipper the trim

801
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,960
machine

802
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,400
i've seen it put through everything pay

803
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,519
attention to your lanyard i recommend

804
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,360
the little armband they sell

805
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,519
armband you can put your badge in there

806
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,639
put it on your arm it's not dangling off

807
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,918
of you it's not going to end up

808
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,440
in the nutrients it's not going to end

809
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,720
up in the plants and the trimmer it's

810
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,000
not going to end up getting you in

811
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,558
trouble it's not going to get stuck in a

812
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,640
fan

813
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,079
so the fans are dangerous you guys if

814
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,559
you got dreadlocks long hair

815
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,279
ponytails keep that [ __ ] tucked away

816
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,200
don't get them

817
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,639
tied up in a fan i think my dreads would

818
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,759
ruin a fan honestly if it

819
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,679
grabbed one of these i probably just

820
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,879
inked the fan off the wall i'm gonna win

821
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,120
i don't know what kind of situation

822
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,080
you've got be careful i want to keep

823
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,959
moving

824
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,279
um where are we how do i fit this one in

825
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
here

826
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,119
people may not be prepared for this

827
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,199
safety uh grow room safety

828
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,359
it's going to stink part of being safe

829
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,319
is not being detected by the police

830
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,959
so legal safety it's going to stink be

831
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,599
prepared

832
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,440
have carbon filtration have an excuse if

833
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,278

853
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,319

860
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,839
now let's talk about uh personal safety

861
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,440
one of the main

862
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,038
ways to keep yourself safe when it comes

863
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,200
to growing is to shut

864
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,480
the [ __ ] up don't tell anybody that

865
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,840
doesn't need to know

866
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,839
i know it's a lot of fun talking about

867
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,678
growing i am in a completely legal

868
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,158
environment i grow commercially it is my

869
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,320
job

870
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,360
i pay taxes on it i get a paycheck for

871
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,038
it that's what i do

872
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,558

874
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:46,879

878
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,119
so shut the [ __ ] up about your grow and

879
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,678
don't tell people unless it needs to be

880
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,839
known

881
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,120
that is personal safety keep your grow

882
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,959
and yourself safe

883
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,479
don't tell people if they don't need to

884
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
know they don't need to know don't bring

885
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,159
people into the grow nobody else needs

886
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,000
to be there unless they're helping you

887
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,679
and you're paying them nobody else needs

888
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,919
to be in that grow but you don't show it

889
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,720
off

890
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,640
don't flex take some pictures once the

891
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,200
product is harvested dried cured and

892
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,880
either smoked or removed from your area

893
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,319
post some pictures up to social media

894
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,760
and get some bragging rights there

895
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,678
but you don't need to bring people in

896
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,079
there and show you and that leads me

897
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,919
into

898
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,519
internet safety there are a lot of

899
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,159
things to talk about when it comes to

900
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,798
internet

901
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,799
safety not just uh the safety of the

902
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,879
internet are you revealing your identity

903
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,400
are you revealing your location in your

904
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
pictures are you showing that you're

905
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,759
allowed six plants but in your photos

906
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,519
you blatantly have 18

907
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,519
think about that type of internet safety

908
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,839
then think about even further

909
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,679
um security codes passwords is anybody

910
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,158
hacking you is anybody watching you

911
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,400
is your internet hurts let me try that

912
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,520
again is your internet search history

913
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,440
that was the word i wanted

914
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,798
is your internet search history going to

915
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,558
be a problem

916
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:57,839
if anybody wants to look at that so

917
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:59,678
think about internet

918
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,199
safety think about what you're posting

919
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,880
think about when you post it think about

920
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,720
what is in your photos

921
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,240
if i went outside to my front yard and

922
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,319
took a photo uh

923
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,079
facing a selfie facing away from my

924
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,038
house but you caught my neighbor's house

925
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,879
in the background

926
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,319
you could probably look at my neighbor's

927
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,760
address and drive around you know what

928
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,319
area i live in you may be able

929
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,038
to triangulate my location so be very

930
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,359
careful

931
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,640
with what you post on the internet also

932
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,319
if you've got kids

933
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,000
be very careful with the kids in the

934
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,079
house if you've got a grow room

935
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
make sure it is locked and the kids do

936
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,278
not have access to it

937
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,720
maybe you're one of those people who is

938
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,000
growing for a sick child maybe you're

939
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,079
one of the people who allows

940
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,278
a child to help you in the grow make

941
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,359
sure that that child

942
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,720
does not have access to the grow without

943
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,359
your supervision

944
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,839
also there are many legalities involving

945
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,839
children

946
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,918
and your growth so be careful that takes

947
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,599
me back to be careful what you post

948
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,360
if it's not legal for that child to be

949
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,959
in your grow do not post a picture of

950
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,119
that child in your grow

951
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,400
think about what you're posting be safe

952
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,239
keep the kids out of the grow

953
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,600
keep them safe also be honest with the

954
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,960
children i think that's the best way to

955
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,519
teach them if they say what's going on

956
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
down there

957
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,960
say grow in medicine otherwise they

958
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,158
think there's [ __ ] aliens down there

959
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,200
and they really want to know

960
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,039
but if you tell them what's happening

961
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,400
and you're honest they might might let

962
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:13,278
you get away with it so

963
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,159
let's move our way into pets i don't

964
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,400
like seeing

965
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,760
cats and dogs in the grow room i know a

966
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,120
lot of people like to take their animals

967
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,000
in there they're inclusive

968
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,599
but i feel that pets are vectors of

969
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,038
problems they carry they're probably

970
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,240
carrying spider mites or some sort of

971
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,158
bug that i don't want

972
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,679
or a dander or a mold or some [ __ ] that

973
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,039
i don't want they're out there running

974
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,559
around they're down there low by the

975
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:33,200
ground they play in the bushes they do

976
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:34,960
all that [ __ ]

977
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,240
i don't want that in my grow i keep the

978
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
pets out of the grove that is me

979
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,720
personally

980
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,480
that's my recommendation you do what

981
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,200
makes you happy but just know that is a

982
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,240
potential

983
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,640
carrier for problems also

984
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,519
keep your pets safe if they do come in

985
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
the grow

986
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,278
like i said earlier we're applying

987
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,679
pesticides we're using nutrients

988
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,398
dogs and cats especially dogs just like

989
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,240
to eat random [ __ ] and lick it anything

990
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,319
some of those nutrients and pesticides

991
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
could be very problematic for a little

992
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,158
dog even for a big dog

993
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,440
if a dog ate a bottle of nutrients they

994
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,440
would get sick if a dog

995
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,038
ate a bottle of pesticides it would get

996
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,558
sick keep that in mind

997
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,720
for your pets let's love our pets the

998
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,200
best we can and keep them safe as well

999
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,278
so grow room safety keep the pets and

1000
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,720
the kids out of there and keep them safe

1001
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,038
now another thing i want to talk about

1002
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,640
is environmental impact

1003
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,319
um not only do we need to think about

1004
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,960
being safe we need to think about what

1005
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,200
we're doing

1006
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,399
to the earth to the world are you

1007
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
causing a problem

1008
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,319
are you going to do something that's

1009
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,000
irreversible the earth is not yours that

1010
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,319
little square patch that you own

1011
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,839
that's yours but the rest of it is

1012
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,519
everybody else's and you only own the

1013
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,879
ground you don't own all the air

1014
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,240
and all the bugs they tried to fly in

1015
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,840
and out of there you don't own the life

1016
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,359
that evolves around that earth around

1017
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,079
that patch of land so

1018
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,479
be mindful of your environmental impact

1019
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,158
on

1020
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,399
your grow if you're growing indoors or

1021
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,120
outdoors there are things to think about

1022
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,798
as a bottled nutrient user i get a lot

1023
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,558
of bottles i try to find places to

1024
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,720
recycle but they don't want to recycle

1025
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,398
nutrient bottles in many locations

1026
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,079
so think about that sort of stuff we

1027
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:04,959
need to get away from bottles buy bigger

1028
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,798
bottles if you can

1029
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,399
don't buy a bunch of quartz buy the big

1030
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,440
five gallon if you can do that

1031
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,000
think about ways to increase uh your or

1032
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,000
decrease

1033
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,359
your carbon footprint something to think

1034
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,640
about

1035
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,479
i'm talking about trash we throw a lot

1036
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,520
of [ __ ] away when you throw out your

1037
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,440
trash

1038
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,599
is it possible that anybody can discover

1039
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,038
you're a grower through your trash

1040
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,719
looking in the trash do they find

1041
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,480
nutrient bottles are they finding

1042
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,960
pesticide bottles are they finding old

1043
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,038
scrap

1044
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,720
leaf are they finding old stems be

1045
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:33,599
careful with your trash once that goes

1046
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,759
out onto the curb

1047
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,278
that is public property the cops can go

1048
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,879
through it your neighbors can go through

1049
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,079
it the hobos are probably going to go

1050
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,919
through it

1051
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,359
think about what they're going to find

1052
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,240
do you need to get rid of your trash

1053
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,079
more carefully

1054
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,519
i want to keep moving i've got a really

1055
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,960
long list of stuff i want to cover and i

1056
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,319
feel like i'm already quite a ways into

1057
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,038
this podcast

1058
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,960
so um always grow with the appropriate

1059
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,119
equipment i see a lot of people building

1060
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,558
makeshift grows i understand you don't

1061
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,759
have a unlimited budget

1062
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:01,918
and you've got to work with what you've

1063
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,640
got but some of that [ __ ] gets

1064
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,960
dangerous the most dangerous things i

1065
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,840
see

1066
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,640
is inappropriate electric run your

1067
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,759
electricity

1068
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,840
appropriately use the proper electric

1069
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,038
fixtures i see people just doing random

1070
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,359
crazy [ __ ] they have

1071
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,960
people who are nowhere near certified

1072
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,479
electricians going in and just running

1073
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,159
wires and doing weird [ __ ]

1074
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,319
that is a potential hazard that could

1075
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,520
burn down your house if you're sharing a

1076
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,319
building that can burn down that

1077
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,639
building

1078
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,439
please don't be that person who ruined

1079
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,038
the neighborhood

1080
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,720
because you had some one of your friends

1081
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,359
just run some wire so we could run more

1082
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,960
lights

1083
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,959
don't do that if you're going to have

1084
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,000
electrical upgrades make sure it is done

1085
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,679
by a

1086
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,119
what are they a certified registered

1087
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,640
master electrician i don't know the uh

1088
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,319
the real word a real electrician

1089
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,080
somebody who's licensed and bonded

1090
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,599
somebody that if they cause a problem

1091
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,879
you can call them say it's your fault

1092
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,719
and you [ __ ] this up you're supposed to

1093
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,240
have a license not just one of your bros

1094
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,798
because i think it's this wire and this

1095
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,880
wire have it done professionally

1096
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,319
proper electric is very important we're

1097
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,440
running a lot of power we can cause a

1098
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,918
lot of problems

1099
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,320
uh to go with that i say always have a

1100
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,799
smoke alarm a smoke detector in the grow

1101
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,960
room

1102
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,720
i highly recommend that also think about

1103
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,480
what you're gonna do if that goes off

1104
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,278
because that will bring attention

1105
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,038
so you need to have a fire extinguisher

1106
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:16,480
either the handheld type that is big

1107
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,158
enough for your space

1108
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,759
if you've got like five or six lights

1109
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,880
you need a bigger fire extinguisher if

1110
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,398
you've only got one light

1111
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,240
you may be okay with the smaller fire

1112
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:25,439
extinguisher think about the potential

1113
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,798
problem you're going to have to deal

1114
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,919
with and have the equipment

1115
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:32,000
prepared to combat that issue they do

1116
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,240
make a fire extinguisher that hangs

1117
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,759
from the ceiling in a grow room and if

1118
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,599
it reaches a certain temperature

1119
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,079
it basically ruptures and it drops a

1120
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:42,079
fire retardant dust all over the grow

1121
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,119
it will destroy your garden but it will

1122
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,038
put out the fire

1123
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,959
and rescue the rest of your house so if

1124
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:48,480
that is an option i highly recommend

1125
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,840
that if you've got higher ceilings

1126
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,079
if you've got enough space and you can

1127
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,678
afford it i like the uh

1128
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,199
fire extinguisher that hangs from the

1129
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,798
ceiling it's a big red ball

1130
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,798
and if it gets too hot it simply

1131
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,639
explodes boom and then this

1132
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,398
white powdery dust comes out and it

1133
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,080
falls all over the room and it basically

1134
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,398
extinguishes the fire that way

1135
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,519
so a fire extinguisher is something i

1136
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,678
highly recommend

1137
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,720
to go with your smoke detector we want

1138
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,559
to catch that smoke

1139
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,159
blast out the fire and not have any

1140
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,398
problems keep the fire extinguisher

1141
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,399
on the outside of the grow room door if

1142
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,158
you do hear that smoke alarm going off

1143
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,439
you're going to touch the door see how

1144
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,799
hot it is

1145
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,798
if it's really hot you may just want to

1146
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,720
[ __ ] run if it's kind of warm

1147
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,558
push that door open back up assess the

1148
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,120
situation have that fire extinguisher in

1149
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,359
your hand

1150
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,719
get going start spraying if it's too bad

1151
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:33,119
get the [ __ ] out of there you guys just

1152
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,798
run

1153
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,398
to get the good [ __ ] that you can get

1154
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:36,879
the kids get the dog get the [ __ ] out of

1155
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,599
there

1156
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,080
but try to extinguish it aim at the base

1157
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,519
also

1158
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,960
understand how to use your fire

1159
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,679
extinguisher make sure that it's fully

1160
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,519
charged

1161
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,519
understand you pull the pin you do this

1162
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,200
you point here maybe practice

1163
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,399
maybe if you're intimidated by the fire

1164
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,038
extinguisher if you think it's going to

1165
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,558
be scary

1166
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:53,599
just grab the fire extinguisher and take

1167
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:54,879
it out to the yard and just give it a

1168
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,678
little spray see what kind of pressure

1169
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,679
comes out of it

1170
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,679
see how it jerks yeah it jumps around be

1171
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,200
prepared i know at a lot of places

1172
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,798
if you go work at a new warehouse or a

1173
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,880
new facility they will actually train

1174
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,558
you and how to use the fire extinguisher

1175
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,919
so that if you do need it you're not in

1176
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:08,879
full [ __ ] panic mode it's something

1177
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,278
you've done before

1178
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,559
so have a smoke alarm and have a fire

1179
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:12,960
extinguisher something i've already

1180
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:15,678
mentioned

1181
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,319
is a door lock lock everything lock

1182
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,200
everything

1183
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,119
twice maybe lock everything a third time

1184
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,440
just for safety we don't need anybody

1185
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,359
not invited getting into our grows

1186
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,880
also that comes back around to shut the

1187
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,879
[ __ ] up don't tell anybody

1188
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,320
if they don't know it's there they don't

1189
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,320
know it's there

1190
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,519
now we've got everything locked we've

1191
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,319
got everything safe

1192
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,319
the next step i think is cameras if you

1193
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,678
can put up cameras near your grow

1194
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,678
without being obvious that you're

1195
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,880
watching your grow that is a great thing

1196
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,960
to do because

1197
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,000
now you know when intruders are coming

1198
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,679
and you can also

1199
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,119
check on the plants while you're away

1200
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,679
you can just open up your phone and go

1201
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,119
oh

1202
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,798
that room looks good none of the plants

1203
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,000
look super droopy the plants look happy

1204
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,519
the reservoirs are full

1205
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,038
i can see most of the things i need to

1206
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,000
see i set up my camera store i can see

1207
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,119
what i need to see

1208
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,038
and we've got a little bit of

1209
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,398
reassurance and security at the same

1210
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,319
time

1211
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,398
another thing i really like in the grow

1212
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,878
for safety and for many other reasons

1213
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,239
is something like a pl grow minder unit

1214
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,000
or something similar

1215
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,158
this will tell me if the room gets too

1216
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,398
hot or too cold while i'm away

1217
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,200
if i if i reach a certain condition in

1218
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:18,878
my grow room

1219
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,878
my phone will beep and tell me hey you

1220
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:21,598
need to check this out i open up the app

1221
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:23,838
on my phone

1222
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,919
i look at the peel grow minder uh

1223
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:26,719
information and it'll say hey it's 90

1224
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,638
degrees in here

1225
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,158
i'll go i need to solve that problem

1226
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,878
then i open up the camera look at the

1227
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,039
camera and go

1228
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,480
oh the plants definitely look hot and i

1229
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,599
can see that that fan over there isn't

1230
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,559
running or i can see that that air

1231
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,159
conditioner you can't see the air

1232
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,918
conditioner cut off but you get my point

1233
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,679
i can open up the minder unit then i can

1234
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,358
look on camera try to identify the

1235
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,639
problem if i need to get to the grow i

1236
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,918
can get over there and fix it

1237
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,760
so cameras and a pl minder unit together

1238
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,279
are invaluable you can see what's going

1239
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,720
on and then you get a warning on your

1240
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,960
phone if anything is out of the

1241
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,919
parameters would you expect it to be

1242
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
another thing i like is a high heat

1243
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,079
shutdown

1244
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,000
i've got a device on my grow lights so

1245
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
all of my grow lights plug into one unit

1246
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,480
then that unit plugs into

1247
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,679
the 240 uh the dryer looking plug before

1248
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,559
that dryer plug

1249
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,679
i have got a high heat shutdown it plugs

1250
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,639
into the dryer plug

1251
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,639
then my light box plugs into that and

1252
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,920
that has a wire that goes up to the very

1253
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,759
center of the room

1254
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,240
if that room reaches a hundred and ten

1255
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,119
degrees uh everything turns off it just

1256
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,039
cuts the power

1257
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,960
to that whole box all of my lights turn

1258
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,880
off it's not gonna heat up anymore

1259
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,400
that will save me from roasting the

1260
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,720
entire room and it's adjustable i can

1261
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,240
change it from 90 to 110 as the range

1262
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:37,838
i think i just left it at 110 when i

1263
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,598
bought it so i've got a high

1264
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,679
heat shut down to where if the room gets

1265
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,760
too hot the lights just shut right off

1266
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,118
i did not plug the air conditioner into

1267
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,800
that same receptacle

1268
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,480
so the air conditioner will continue to

1269
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,320
run if it was running

1270
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,079
i'm assuming that since it's 110 degrees

1271
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
in there that air conditioner [ __ ] up

1272
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,440
i need to go check it out my pl girl

1273
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,880
minder unit sent me a message

1274
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,320
i got to open it up and look and say

1275
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,200
it's 100 degrees in there i need to go

1276
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,119
figure this out

1277
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,719
but that high heat shutdown will shut it

1278
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,079
down while i'm in the car

1279
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,000
running to the grow trying to get there

1280
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,920
before the plants melt

1281
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,320
um i mentioned this before another thing

1282
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,320
we need is plenty of carbon filters we

1283
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,200
need to control the aroma and odors of

1284
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,200
our grows

1285
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,799
if you're in a non-legal state that

1286
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,439
aroma will be enough to get you in

1287
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,160
trouble

1288
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,679
have enough carbon filtration have a

1289
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,118
carbon filter in the grow

1290
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,960
if you're extracting air make sure that

1291
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,720
that air is filtered something you can

1292
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,480
do is just set up a carbon filter and a

1293
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,000
blower and just have it blow

1294
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,920
in the room you're just filtering the

1295
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,280
air taking out the aroma it's also

1296
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,039
sucking up any dust

1297
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,320
anything that might be floating around

1298
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,239
just keeping the air clean

1299
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,640
while sucking out some aroma keeping you

1300
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,439
a little bit safe also uh right by the

1301
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,118
front door

1302
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,800
and any entrances and exits of your

1303
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,640
house maybe you have a little air

1304
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,720
freshener i like to keep the cans

1305
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,159
of uh i can't it's called it's a can of

1306
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,000
ozone can't think of what it's called

1307
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,559
right on a gel that is what it's called

1308
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,280
i keep the jars of ona gel near the

1309
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,039
doors

1310
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,119
it's just a jar with the lid you can

1311
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,639
unscrew the lid i don't unscrew the lid

1312
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,000
i honestly get a drill and i drill six

1313
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,199
or eight holes in the top of the lid it

1314
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,119
keeps my own a gel

1315
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,239
uh the gel has to stay moist once it

1316
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,039
dries it stops making

1317
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,399
air aroma so just drill holes in there

1318
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,920
keep the owner gel jar

1319
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,119
i just put it behind a picture right by

1320
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,320
the door so when you come in the house

1321
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,519
you look at the picture of my daughter

1322
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,039
your daughter is beautiful you don't

1323
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:17,920
even know there's a [ __ ] own a jar

1324
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:19,199
hidden behind there

1325
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,039
you smell it you go it smells great in

1326
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:22,719
your house and i'm like i see my kid

1327
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,838
you smell my aroma you think i'm a good

1328
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,279
person you don't even know there's a

1329
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:26,639
bunch of [ __ ] plants in the house it

1330
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,599
works really well so

1331
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,719
cover your aroma ona gels uh maybe some

1332
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,480
ozium spray

1333
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,239
don't use the thing that sprays every

1334
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,760
[ __ ] 20 minutes that's obvious that

1335
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,838
you're hiding something

1336
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,280
but carbon filters owner gels those will

1337
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,119
help you out

1338
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,119
another thing i see people make mistakes

1339
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,280
is timers they cannot handle

1340
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,200
the load which we are assigning to these

1341
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,800
timers we plug the timer into the wall

1342
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,799
then we plug a thousand watt light into

1343
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,000
that timer sometimes we plug 2000 watt

1344
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,839
lights into that timer

1345
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,760
and we expect that timer to turn off and

1346
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,799
on every day as it's supposed to do but

1347
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,359
what we didn't think about

1348
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,200
is we're running 2 000 watt lights on

1349
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:01,759
this one shitty timer and it's going to

1350
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,838
melt

1351
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,680
it may not have the capacity so make

1352
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,440
sure that the timers you buy

1353
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,440
are strong enough to run the amount of

1354
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,200
electricity you are pushing through them

1355
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,480
electricity can be very dangerous i've

1356
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,199
talked about this recently in this

1357
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,880
episode

1358
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,879
let's not be the person burning down the

1359
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,320
house by drawing too much electricity

1360
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,079
through one receptacle

1361
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,680
if you feel like your equipment if the

1362
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,359
plug-in at the wall is getting hot

1363
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,799
if your timer is getting hot if your

1364
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,960
extension cord is getting hot

1365
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,359
it's not thick enough strong enough you

1366
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,440
need a bigger more powerful heavier duty

1367
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:32,719
timer and extension cord i don't like

1368
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,599
extension cords that's going to be the

1369
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,000
next one

1370
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,800
no shitty extension cords it's got to be

1371
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,719
the big

1372
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,800
thick insulated extension cord or get

1373
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,919
the [ __ ] out if you bring in that little

1374
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,519
the one that you're going to use to plug

1375
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,159
in the printer or the extension cord for

1376
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,320
your phone

1377
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,239
don't put that in my grow no not

1378
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,880
qualified all of the extension cords

1379
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,439
have to be

1380
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,640
quality extension cords the good thick

1381
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,639
kind and always

1382
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,838
like we talked about earlier keep your

1383
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:57,118
electricity up

1384
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:58,719
off the ground don't have a bunch of

1385
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,480
cords on the ground don't have a bunch

1386
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,159
of extension cords down on the floor

1387
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,679
keep your electricity up high or if

1388
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,960
there is water on the floor you don't

1389
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,519
have any interaction between the

1390
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,800
electric

1391
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:08,239
and the water the water is going to go

1392
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,519
straight to the floor keep that

1393
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,358
electricity up high

1394
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,519
three feet off the ground or higher is

1395
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,078
ideal so no shitty extension cords and

1396
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,039
be very

1397
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,880
careful with your cords your cables

1398
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,000
think about be mindful don't trip over

1399
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,039
them don't get them wet

1400
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,960
don't have them in places where they're

1401
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,320
going to cause problems set yourself up

1402
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,838
for success

1403
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,519
another thing you really need to think

1404
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,679
about and have prepared in a grow

1405
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,358
is a first aid kit i don't want you to

1406
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,919
have to use it but i hope that it is

1407
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:33,598
there

1408
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,039
i talked earlier about a friend getting

1409
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,519
ph down on his eye

1410
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,559
wiped around his finger wiped his eye ph

1411
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:40,480
down in his eye

1412
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,759
now he's got a call 9-1-1 that is a

1413
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,599
terrible situation

1414
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,800
he had to walk up the grove and scramble

1415
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,400
up to the top of the stairs and get

1416
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,599
outside of his house before anybody

1417
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
showed up so he didn't get himself in

1418
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,000
trouble

1419
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,240
have a first aid kit on hand is what i'm

1420
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,159
getting at if something does go wrong

1421
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,838
you would much rather have a first aid

1422
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,519
kit to take care of yourself then have

1423
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:58,719
to scramble around and find all the [ __ ]

1424
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,400
to handle yourself

1425
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,078
if you cut yourself you're gonna need

1426
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,519
some gauze you may need some band-aids

1427
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,000
you may need some peroxide to clean

1428
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,599
yourself

1429
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,599
out maybe a couple of butterfly

1430
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,160
band-aids think about that sort of stuff

1431
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,200
maybe a little bit of burn cream maybe

1432
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,960
you're just a

1433
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,239
a clumsy person maybe you were always

1434
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,318
hurting yourself

1435
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:17,919
know what you do to yourself we know as

1436
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,279
guys i know that i like to cut my

1437
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,400
fingers a lot doing dumb [ __ ] trying to

1438
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,319
pry something open

1439
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,000
these regions of our hands they get cut

1440
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:25,838
up a lot be prepared for that [ __ ]

1441
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,119
have some band-aids have something to

1442
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:28,559
clean that have some of those

1443
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,358
butterflies around

1444
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,559
multiple sizes of band-aids also eye

1445
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:34,480
wash

1446
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,159
many people overlook eye wash you can

1447
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,440
buy a bottle of eye wash

1448
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,759
from um uline is the place where we get

1449
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,519
them

1450
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,040
get the bottles of eye wash and if you

1451
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,159
do get a pesticide in your eye if you

1452
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,000
get something in your eyes

1453
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,279
grab that bottle it's got a little spout

1454
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,358
on it all you got to do is take off the

1455
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,280
cap and squeeze it right into your eyes

1456
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,279
it will rinse your eyes out help you out

1457
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,599
quite a bit then you can get more help

1458
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,440
but

1459
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,359
have that eye wash around in a

1460
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,480
commercial environment we're required to

1461
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:00,078
have an eye wash

1462
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,039
uh within i don't remember the exact

1463
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,079
amount of feet right now i shouldn't

1464
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,559
admit that i have to read the rules

1465
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,000
again

1466
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,920
but most of the time if you're applying

1467
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,400
a pesticide you need eye wash within

1468
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,079
reach

1469
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,079
so we tell the guys to carry a bottle of

1470
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,960
water or the little eye wash bottle on

1471
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,640
their person

1472
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,480
while applying a pesticide so that if

1473
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,679
you [ __ ] up if the fan blows the

1474
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,639
pesticide into your eyes you can just

1475
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,838
reach into your pocket

1476
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,358
rinse your eyes off right there you

1477
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:20,000
don't have to go too far because you are

1478
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:21,279
blinded

1479
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,719
with [ __ ] in your eye you may not be

1480
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
able to find your way out of the grow

1481
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,959
room

1482
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,800
so have eyewash available also

1483
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,639
i talked about my friend who had to use

1484
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,119
siri i'm making sure siri doesn't fire

1485
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,279

to the doctor if you got to go to the

1514
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,119
hospital because you cut yourself in the

1515
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,960
grow room

1516
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,240

1519
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,800
say i was growing weed and i cut myself

know what you're gonna say

1527
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,400
then here's the worst part that you can

1528
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,599
think of but it's the last thing on my

1529
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,079
list

1530
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,960
how about some bail money and a lawyer

1531
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,800
on retainer

1532
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,079
if you're getting into the grow game and

1533
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,720
you've got a couple of harvests under

1534
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,839
your belt

1535
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:51,039
you're starting to make a name for

1536
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:51,838
yourself and this is something you're

1537
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,679
gonna do

1538
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,759
you need a lawyer and you need bail

1539
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,519
money have that bail money

1540
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,440
at your lawyer's office so where

1541
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,519
anything goes wrong you call your lawyer

1542
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,960
and he goes dory i got you he's already

1543
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,318
on retainer you've paid him a little bit

1544
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,920
of money you pay him every couple of

1545
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,599
months just to keep him on your side

1546
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,119
he's got that money in his safe then

1547
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,800
when [ __ ] goes wrong he just drives

1548
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,720
right over pays your bail money and gets

1549
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,480
you moving it's not a long process have

1550
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,358
that bail money and that lawyer on

1551
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,679
retainer

1552
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:18,480
then have your lawyer's phone number in

1553
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,639
your phone

1554
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,000
and also try to memorize it because when

1555
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,279
you're handcuffed

1556
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,559
and you're being booked you don't get

1557
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,000
your phone to go through all those phone

1558
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:26,480
numbers you're gonna need to know his

1559
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,559
number

1560
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,400
so remember your emergency contacts

1561
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,119
phone number and remember your lawyer's

1562
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,039
phone number

1563
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,039
have that lawyer on retainer and have

1564
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,318
some bail money set aside

1565
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,838

1566
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:39,358

1568

to have to use the first aid kit

1569
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,318
but if we need them i want them to be

1570
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,440
