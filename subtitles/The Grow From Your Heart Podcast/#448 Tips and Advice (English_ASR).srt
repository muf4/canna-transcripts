00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,839

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,198

7
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:30,509

00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:33,210
www.ctvn.org e and jam-band

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,469
the aroma is really funky I'm cracking

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,558
it open right now to get a fresh smell

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,500
it's got a immediately a gassy dirty

12
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,359
aroma right off the crack of the jar as

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,920
soon as I open it there is a gassy smell

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,539
then there is a rotten fruit sort of a

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,450
thing on the background I think it is

16
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,070
delicious the flavor is gassy and gross

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,649
all at the same time it coats your mouth

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,600
so deliciously the potency label says

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,329
this product contains seventy two point

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,910
nine percent THC and eighty four point

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,299
four percent total cannabinoids I really

22
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:05,700
like the Tahoe Jam Fambrough juh from

23
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,170

via stabby mixed a person who spoke

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,730
highly of your work and made me curious

66
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,439
I meant big shout out to my friend

67
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:39,179
stabby stabby is a great person a great

68
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,818
dude he is also a panelist on the

69
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,680
embracing organic show we have become

70
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,329
quite good friends lately and it's good

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,090
to hear that stabby is speaking well of

72
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,560
me so the message goes on it says I

73
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,590
don't have money to support you on

74
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,449
patreon or buy your seeds but I would

75
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,430
like to support by giving some grow tips

76
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:58,469
of my own which I have picked up and I

77
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,230
felt could help you out if you have not

78
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,090
heard them yet so my new friend here

79
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:04,768
wants to support the show he is not in a

80
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,629
position to financially contribute to

81
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,879
the show he is not in a situation where

82
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:11,489
he needs seeds so he is doing his giving

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,810
back by sending us some useful advice I

84
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,330
thought I would share this advice with

85
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,750
you guys and here are some tips sent in

86
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,820
by our friend tip number one is sworsky

87
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,459
predator mites can get expensive and

88
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,349
need to be reapplied I talk quite often

89
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,750
about using sworsky predator mice as

90
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:29,370
part of my integrated pest management

91
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,019
yes they do need to be reapplied it does

92
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,629
take some time to establish colonies

93
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,840
this email comes with some great advice

94
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:39,479
it says if you grow banker plants or

95
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,000
companion plants such as poinsettias and

96
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,639
place a few between each plant in the

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,319
veg and flower room thus worse Keys will

98
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,289
feed on the pollen from the pepper

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,389
plants and tell your bad bugs arrive or

100
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,578
return so if you have released

101
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,500
Swarovski's in your grow eventually they

102
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,480
are going to eat all of the bad mites

103
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,009
hopefully in theory they're going to get

104
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,319
in there and they are going to eradicate

105
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:03,120
all of the intrusive spider mites at

106
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,799
that point in time those Swarovski's

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,750
will go hey there's nothing here for me

108
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,920
I'm gonna take off and just like you

109
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,419
they're gonna want to eat and they're

110
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,949
gonna want to get laid so they're gonna

111
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,108
leave they're gonna go find a better

112
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,988
opportunity to eat and get laid if you

113
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:18,840
have some point set ax or pepper plants

114
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,579
in your grow those Swarovski's can feed

115
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,228
off of the pollen so they will have

116
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,569
something to survive off of and you

117
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,610
don't need bad bugs in your situation in

118
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,209
your environment to continue to keep the

119
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,699
popular

120
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:32,370
Asians of Swarovski's colonized in your

121
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,319
facility or in your outdoor grow so that

122
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,060
is a very useful tip if you are trying

123
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,650
to establish and keep colonies of

124
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,870
Swarovski's around in your facility or

125
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:42,000
in your outdoor grow some points Etta's

126
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,918
or some pepper plants will help them

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,800
stick around because they can simply

128
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,689
feed off of that pollen now this email

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,788
continues he said I learned this from

130
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,978
psyche angel on Instagram now psyche

131
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:55,228
angel is an IPM specialist and an

132
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:57,240
entomologist and he says I've seen my

133
00:04:55,228 --> 00:05:00,029
buddy's garden effectively maintaining

134
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,699
his sworsky population and he also says

135
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:05,309
females were skis produce three times

136
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,560
more when on a pollen diet so you'll be

137
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,240
able to increase your population quite

138
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,310
quickly if you are feeding them the

139
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,439
proper pollen it goes on to say the

140
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,120
point setters make copious amounts of

141
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,490
pollen which you probably already know

142
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,740
peppers won't pollinate cannabis plants

143
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,658
and keep the good bugs around sort of

144
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,449
like a barracks of soldiers waiting to

145
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:26,639
deploy when the bad bugs come around yes

146
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,710
that is absolutely correct the pollen

147
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,210
from the poinsettias cannot pollinate

148
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,348
your cannabis plant so that's not

149
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,879
anything to worry about I'm sure

150
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:35,189
somebody was thinking that I'm glad you

151
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,779
corrected that then yes you were correct

152
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:38,939
then we've got a barracks of soldiers

153
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,279
waiting to deploy for when the bad bugs

154
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,649
if the bad bugs do decide to come back

155
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,478
around then we don't need to worry about

156
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:46,500
building our population it is already

157
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,968
there ready to go

158
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,288
you've got the troops all lined up

159
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:50,610
they're just waiting for the signal

160
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,779
they're just waiting for the little

161
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,639
bells and they could slide down the pole

162
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,989
like firemen and just get out there and

163
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,120
start destroying [ __ ]

164
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,918
keeps on going it says swore skis are an

165
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,129
excellent generalist and will actually

166
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:04,529
eat nearly all cannabis pests yes that's

167
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:06,779
absolutely correct that is why I like

168
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,848
the swore skis in almost all commercial

169
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,679
grows I use them outside in some

170
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:13,348
environments and I even use them in

171
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,959
small caregiver personal private grow

172
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:17,848
situations so big thank you for grow tip

173
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,888
number one if you guys out there would

174
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:21,629
like to keep your sworsky populations up

175
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,728
this person recommends adding a

176
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,408
poinsettia plant to the room and letting

177
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:27,718
it pollinate and those Swarovski's can

178
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:30,449
live off of that pollen while the bad

179
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:32,699
bugs are sparse now let's move on to

180
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:36,000
grow tip number two this is a good one

181
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:38,129
it says if seeds don't crack after 48

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,019
hours in a paper towel you can use a

183
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:42,639
seed cracker okay let's talk about that

184
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,349
when I germinate seeds I recommend

185
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,419
folding a paper towel you fold it once

186
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,800
you fold it twice maybe once more then

187
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,900
you soak it with water that's the way I

188
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,850
do it then I unfold it I put the seeds

189
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:53,409
about in the center of that and I fold

190
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,330
it all back up and then I will either

191
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,520
set that on a plate and a room or I can

192
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:59,259
pay attention to it or if I'm leaving I

193
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,089
will put it in a baggie and seal the

194
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,800
baggie the purpose for putting in the

195
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,419
baggie and sealing it is now I have kept

196
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
the moisture in there that moisture

197
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,350
can't disappear if I'm gone for longer

198
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,939
than expected those seeds will not dry

199
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,520
up and die we've talked on a previous

200
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,629
episode about how my stoned-ass

201
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,479
germinated a bunch of expensive seeds

202
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,379
went to work came home went to bed woke

203
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,970
up in the middle of the night and

204
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,550
realized I just killed a bunch of seeds

205
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,620
and I put them in a baggie that probably

206
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,509
would not have happened so I like to

207
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,459
fold a paper towel soak the paper towel

208
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:29,649
either put it in a baggie or put it on a

209
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:32,319
plate then you wait I like to unfold

210
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,759
that paper towel every 12 8 hours or so

211
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,699
and check on it see if I've got any

212
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,250
tails coming out of my seeds most of the

213
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,750
time those seeds will sprout within 24

214
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,040
hours they'll start making little tails

215
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,829
they look like a little sperm or a

216
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,569
little worm and they'll start growing

217
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:48,579
sometimes that doesn't happen sometimes

218
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,279
you get a dud and it just doesn't crack

219
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:54,699
this guy says that you can use a seed

220
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:57,279
cracker or you can also use scissors or

221
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,769
a pair of mechanical hemostats to

222
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,439
squeeze the seed until it pops the shell

223
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:04,389
but no further now to be completely

224
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,120
honest with you I do not have any

225
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,339
experience using a seed cracker

226
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,230
anytime a seed is not germinated for me

227
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,449
I've thrown it away and called a dud and

228
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,700
sprouted a new seed in hopes that that

229
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:17,649
one worked seeds can be very delicate

230
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,599
but if you've already tried to soak it

231
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:22,269
for 48 hours and it did not germinate

232
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,040
you don't have much to lose by giving it

233
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:26,560
another shot by using some sort of a

234
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,600
cracking method so he says once the

235
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,060
shells cracked I've had 100 percent

236
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,570
germination rate since trying the seed

237
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,730
cracker he also says I saw a member of

238
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,190
coastal seeds pops some 40 year old

239
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,170
seeds with the seed cracker may not need

240
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,360
to throw under seeds out and start over

241
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,889
if they don't pop right away yes that is

242
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,769
absolutely correct this could be like a

243
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:49,659
second chance if you do your method for

244
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,309
germinating seeds however you do it if

245
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,899
you soak them if you put them in a paper

246
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,039
towel if you put them in a rapid Rooter

247
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,649
if you just bury them straight in the

248
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,480
dirt

249
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,769
and it doesn't work you can dig it up

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,619
you can take it out of the paper towel

251
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:02,568
and this is another last-ditch attempt

252
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:04,550
to getting that seed to pop now I

253
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:07,188
wouldn't personally do this or recommend

254
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:09,378
this until it's been at least 48 or 52

255
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:11,058
or 60-something hours and you're sure

256
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:12,678
that that seed isn't going to pop under

257
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:14,058
your normal method I would make sure

258
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,528
that that seed has been properly

259
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:18,230
moistened I would make sure that it's

260
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:20,028
not too cold cold seeds won't sprout so

261
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,740
if it's a little a little bit too cold

262
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:23,899
it won't do anything if you make it warm

263
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,220
enough it should sprout right now it's

264
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,899
the middle of the summer so it's not

265
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,089
real cold so I would just germinate my

266
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,649
seeds here on the table I would fold the

267
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,240
paper towel up I would soak it put the

268
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:33,678
seeds in there maybe put it in the

269
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,600
baggie maybe not depending on my

270
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,708
schedule and I would just germinate

271
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,178
those seeds right here at the table

272
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,409
right where I hang out so I could check

273
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,850
on them I would see him I wouldn't

274
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:43,219
forget about him and they'd be just

275
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,019
right here part of my normal day if it

276
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,089
were the colder season and I couldn't

277
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:49,129
keep the house warm like it is now I

278
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:51,679
would put that baggie with those seeds

279
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:53,569
on top of my refrigerator I think that

280
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:55,759
heat from the top of the refrigerator is

281
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:58,009
just enough heat to germinate seeds any

282
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,350
warmer than that and you run the risk of

283
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:03,139
burning those seeds I've seen more

284
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,939
people just roast seeds I've seen more

285
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,889
people make popcorn out of seeds I've

286
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,568
seen more people just kill seeds with

287
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,759
the heat mat with some sort of a heat

288
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:12,740
source then I have seen success with a

289
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,409
heat mat so I don't recommend that they

290
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,839
will ruin your seeds unless it is really

291
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:20,328
cold in your environment I also don't

292
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,829
like to pop seeds in a humidity dome I

293
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,659
don't like the dome on there I think

294
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:25,308
that makes them a little bit weak I like

295
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:27,078
to have them exposed as soon as they're

296
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:28,399
growing out that way they can get some

297
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:30,019
wind on them that way they're not

298
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,999
expecting a bunch of humidity if you

299
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,610
germinate a seed in a dome it's

300
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:36,800
expecting that domed condition then you

301
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,778
have to slowly acclimate that clone you

302
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,609
have to let it realize oh I'm not gonna

303
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:42,110
have a dome for 15 minutes and the next

304
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,339
day you give it 30 minutes and you let

305
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,778
it go for a couple days and then you

306
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,309
give it an hour and then you give it two

307
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:48,350
hours and then finally it's used to not

308
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:50,389
having a dome but I don't like starting

309
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,249
a seed under a dome because then it

310
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:53,749
expects it why not just start it in your

311
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:55,879
normal grow environment where you've got

312
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:57,379
the proper VPD you've got a little bit

313
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,360
of airflow going on there's a little bit

314
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:00,920
of wind in there that airflow that wind

315
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,169
happening will give that plant some

316
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,998
strength just imagine when I push you if

317
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,620
I just gently walk by you and shoved you

318
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,810
by your shoulder just as a buddy not as

319
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,129
an [ __ ] just know

320
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:10,539
two on your shoulder just jokingly

321
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:12,429
what's up bro a little shoulder nudge

322
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:14,199
the first thing you do you spread your

323
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:16,359
feet so that you can get better better

324
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,509
balance I feel like when we blow on a

325
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,769
small plant just a little bit of wind it

326
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:22,750
tips over a little bit and it goes oh

327
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,278
[ __ ] I better get my footing and I think

328
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,899
it tries to reach out and it spreads its

329
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:27,789
roots a little bit further and it makes

330
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,169
it a little bit stronger I think a

331
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:31,120
little bit of a struggle makes

332
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:33,370
everything stronger if it's a plant if

333
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,528
it's a person anything a little bit of

334
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,759
adversity a little struggle what happens

335
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,500
when you lift weights when you do some

336
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,509
work you come back stronger I think the

337
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,028
plants respond the same way so I don't

338
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:45,039
like starting my plants in a dome and I

339
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:47,528
certainly do not like starting my plants

340
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,809
with a heat mat I prefer the paper towel

341
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:51,639
I prefer the baggie and I prefer the top

342
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,969
of the refrigerator if I'm going to use

343
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,740
any heat at all so do your best to set

344
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,290
yourself up for success when you were

345
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,028
germinating new or old seeds if you find

346
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:03,189
that your method does not work you've

347
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:04,899
got a back-up plan we can crack them

348
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,339
over some of the ways that our friend

349
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,289
mentioned we could crack them there is a

350
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,500
product called a seed cracker you can

351
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:14,110
buy he also said we can use a small pair

352
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,379
of medical hemostats to gently squeeze

353
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,419
the seed until it pops but no further he

354
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:21,519
also said you can use scissors if you

355
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:24,219
use scissors it is probably easier to

356
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,289
use the part of the scissors closer to

357
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,339
the handle then closer to the tip of the

358
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:29,319
blade there's just a thing about

359
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:30,880
leverage closer to the handle you're

360
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,620
gonna have a little more control it'll

361
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,720
be easier to pop it so get open the

362
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,339
scissors will real wide put your seed

363
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,330
down in there close to the handle then

364
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,130
gently squeeze

365
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,629
you'll feel a little crack it won't take

366
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:43,210
much pressure at all at that point

367
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:45,549
you'll feel a little pop now that seed

368
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,769
has another chance go back try to

369
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,838
rejuvenate it it should sprout and if

370
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,129
not that seed did not stand a chance in

371
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,230
the beginning so we've got another

372
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:54,909
option all right so I want to thank you

373
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,550
for that great tip there is more to this

374
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:59,469
email it says that is it for now

375
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:01,059

376
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,709

379
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:09,159

381

says love what you do and really enjoy

391
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,139
the podcast also I've been cultivating

392
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:33,789
for over a decade I like listening to

393
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,639
your grow tips as I can always learn

394
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:38,949
something new even when reviewing basics

395
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,569
sometimes I'll always be pointing many

396
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,060
new growers to this playlist as well

397
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:46,230
since it answers a lot of questions I

398
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:48,489
get asked on Instagram on a daily basis

399
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,379
so he's saying thanks for the podcast

400
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,389
man thank you for listening he's been

401
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,458
growing for over a decade and still

402
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:55,629
learns things from this podcast you know

403
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,088
what I was listening to somebody the

404
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:59,799
other day they were paying me to do

405
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:01,930
consulting they were paying me to give

406
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,519
them advice and they said something that

407
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,699
I said holy [ __ ] I've never thought of

408
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,440
that

409
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,420
and I pulled out my notebook and I just

410
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,040
casually wrote it down just in my little

411
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:10,750
notebook that I have for consultations

412
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,338
it looks like I was making a note on the

413
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,019
facility or something but I was making a

414
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,640
note on something profound that that

415
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,560
person had said that I had never said

416
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,149
out loud or never thought over never

417
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,949
heard before and I was like hole that's

418
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,139
really good information and they were

419
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,910
paying me to be there so never think

420
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:27,189
that you can't learn something from

421
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:28,778
anybody there's a brand new grower out

422
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,940
there that read a book that you didn't

423
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:32,169
read in one sentence it was really

424
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,700
important stood out to him and you

425
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,929
didn't read that book and he's gonna say

426
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,180
that sentence one day and you're gonna

427
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:39,189
go holy [ __ ] that person that I thought

428
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:41,078
was stupid know some [ __ ] and I'm

429
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,360
impressed so always keep an open mind

430
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:45,699
our friend here has been growing for

431
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,310
over a decade and still finds nuggets of

432
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,649
useful information in my little podcast

433
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:52,989
many mentions reviewing basics yes

434
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,339
sometimes reviewing the basics is very

435
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,289
important like I've mentioned in a

436
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,730
previous episode we had somebody with

437
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:00,099
the grow room issue they thought they

438
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,750
needed a giant consultation when all

439
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,269
they really needed was to take some time

440
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,860
and maybe buy a small piece of equipment

441
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,319
and find out what was happening in the

442
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,389
grow so yes remember the basics you

443
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,190
can't build anything without a solid

444
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:14,169
foundation so don't forget the basics

445
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,390
then he says he's going to share the

446
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:18,370
playlist with his friends and people on

447
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:20,559

474
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,220
comes from they've said their name

475
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,779

and your location both that's a little

481
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,610
too much but our friend is from a place

482
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,379
and he says I recently started growing

483
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,149
with my dad we have a few plants right

484
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:30,580
now that looked great and it turned out

485
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,470
pretty well so far I've worked at a

486
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,150
plant nursery for the past few years and

487
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,120
have always had a fascination with

488
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:38,860
plants specifically cannabis I've been

489
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,389
listening to your podcast for some time

490
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,149
now and I have a few questions that

491
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:46,029
hopefully you can answer well here we go

492
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,590
it says I am currently studying business

493
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:50,769
and I would like to change my major to

494
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:52,960
agriculture and/or agronomy what field

495
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,549
of study would best fit someone who is

496
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,090
looking to pursue a career in

497
00:16:54,549 --> 00:17:00,009
cultivating cannabis secondly what steps

498
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,660
did you take when you first started

499
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:03,250
breeding and cultivating they'd have

500
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:05,619
brought you to the point where you are

501
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:09,970
right now I'd love to hear back from you

502
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:12,729
keep up the bomb ass podcast Thanks see

503
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,440
so our friend C is currently studying

504
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,289
business and would like to change their

505
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,360
major to agriculture or agronomy and

506
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:21,039
they are seeking advice on what field of

507
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,289
study I think would best fit for

508
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,619
somebody who is looking to pursue a

509
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:29,109
career in cultivating cannabis that's a

510
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,669
great question I don't have a clear-cut

511
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:33,099
answer because there are so many

512
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,500
different aspects to the cannabis

513
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,230
industry that I think having your

514
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,619
business education will be more useful

515
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:44,829
than any type of other education I could

516
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:46,929
recommend you have a passion for plants

517
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:49,000
you've already got nursery experience

518
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,370
unless you plan to enter

519
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,169
a facility as an owner or a lead grower

520
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:55,750
you were already on the right path

521
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:57,340
you've got just enough experience in a

522
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,440
plant nursery and you've got a

523
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:01,689
fascination for plants specifically

524
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,880
cannabis where as a candidate for me to

525
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:06,009
hire that makes you a great starting

526
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,230
grower you're the kind of person I want

527
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:09,220
to put on watering plants and I pay

528
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,839
attention to if you can follow

529
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,759
directions for a couple of weeks and

530
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,319
then I give you a few more tasks you

531
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,569
sound like a smart person you sound like

532
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,038
you can handle that stuff so trying to

533
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,629
aim you or point you toward the

534
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:21,158
direction of an agriculture or an

535
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,500
agronomy type of a school or an

536
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,390
education doesn't seem necessary you're

537
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,210
going to learn that and pick that up

538
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:30,820
along the way by being there what the

539
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,860
industry is lacking is business minded

540
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,839
people and it sounds like you probably

541
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:36,490
want to get into the grow you probably

542
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,139
want to play with some dirt you probably

543
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,779
want to cut some plants and pull some

544
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:44,259
leaves there are a lot of those people

545
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:46,418
available and unfortunately the pay rate

546
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:48,429
for those types of jobs is rapidly

547
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:50,980
declining as the cost and price and

548
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,809
value of cannabis declines as cannabis

549
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,400
becomes more regulated and more

550
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,899
available and you can just go to the

551
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,509
store and get it anywhere around here

552
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,100
it's getting much cheaper it is much

553
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:01,839
more affordable for the consumer but

554
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,819
that means on the business end there's

555
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,379
no profit which means the growers are

556
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:07,178
getting paid less the people who are

557
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,150
making the money are on the management

558
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:13,059
end the consultants the lead grower the

559
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,429
I hate the term master grower but that

560
00:19:13,058 --> 00:19:17,829
is just a name for the person in the

561
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:19,269
building who is in charge of the grow

562
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:21,460
there are growers and then there is a

563
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:23,829
master grower it's the lead grower the

564
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,390
cultivation manager that guy he's the

565
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,759
one making the money the other people

566
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,380
are grow techs that are paid as hourly

567
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,179
employees but it's the management is

568
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,950
where the money is so if you want to

569
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:35,048
make money in the cannabis industry you

570
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,509
either need to own your facility or you

571
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:40,210
need to be in the business end of it so

572
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:42,849
unless you are completely set on being

573
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,069
in the cultivation side I recommend you

574
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:47,230
stick to the management aspect of the

575
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:49,480
legal part of cannabis there are many

576
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,269
things we need administration type

577
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,429
people for everybody needs a compliance

578
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:56,440
officer the compliance officer is the

579
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:58,538
person who reads all of the rules and

580
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,580
walks through the retail establishment

581
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:02,808
the cultivation establishment the

582
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:04,579
extraction establishment and makes

583
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:07,039
that that company is following all of

584
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,869
the rules in case any of the inspecting

585
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,918
departments may pop up because they can

586
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:12,109
show up at any time

587
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,790
the marijuana Enforcement Division can

588
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:16,009
show up any time they don't need any

589
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,829
announcements they can walk in knock on

590
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:19,579
the door and say hey we want to inspect

591
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:21,649
everything right now

592
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:23,359
they inspect everything if the

593
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,650
Department of Agriculture decides they

594
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,869
want to come do a surprise inspection

595
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,580
today at your cultivation facility guess

596
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:30,439
what Department of Agriculture

597
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:31,939
inspection happens to day they don't

598
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,798
care how busy you are they don't care

599
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,080
what's happening they need somebody so a

600
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:39,259
compliance officer is a great person to

601
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,089
have in every single facility it sounds

602
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:42,919
like you would make if you were talking

603
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:44,599
about agronomy it sounds like you were

604
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,910
already ahead of the game you understand

605
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,649
agronomics you already are thinking

606
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,150
about where to be it sounds like you

607
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,798
were a forward-thinking person we should

608
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,470
have you in some sort of a management

609
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:56,240
position making strategies thinking long

610
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,400
term moves we need to get you out of the

611
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,808
cultivation and get you up in the ivory

612
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,340
towers with all the other people weren't

613
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,720
suits thinking about the direction of

614
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:05,659
the company we need you helping to drive

615
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,019
the ship so I do appreciate that you

616
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,308
want to better yourself for the

617
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:12,079
agriculture aspect I think you're going

618
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:13,849
to develop that if you've got the

619
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,769
passion and you're already working with

620
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:18,379
plants it's going to come naturally

621
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:20,660
listen to my podcast expose yourself to

622
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,059
the garden be in there you will develop

623
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,558
all of the skills you need rapidly I can

624
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:26,329
tell by the way you wrote this email the

625
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,798
way your punctuation is perfect

626
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:30,139
everything is spelled right you're a

627
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,970
smart person now if you really insist on

628
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,980
being in the grow I think you are at

629
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,269
just the right level to get started

630
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,579
unless you're going to own your own

631
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:40,220
facility I think you were right at the

632
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:42,019
right area for me to hire you people

633
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,759
that know too much are a pain in the ass

634
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:46,400
to hire I wouldn't want to hire somebody

635
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,079
that was his experienced of a grower as

636
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,100
myself had to find the correct words to

637
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,079
say that in my head did not sound

638
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:54,048
egotistical but it would be hard to

639
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,879
retrain me to grow the way I need me to

640
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:58,099
grow in another facility if that makes

641
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,840
any sense you don't have any bad habits

642
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:01,548
that I have to break you can come in

643
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,250
just knowing just enough to be dangerous

644
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:06,109
and I can mold you into the grower that

645
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,660
I need you to be so that we can all be

646
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:10,308
successful in the facility now if you do

647
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,019
intend to be the lead grower or if you

648
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:14,569
want to own your own large scale

649
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:17,690
cultivation facility there are probably

650
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:20,539
large scale commercial cultivation

651
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:23,179
schools it will teach you about farming

652
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:25,490
and about agriculture all of that stuff

653
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:27,530
will apply to your cannabis cultivation

654
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,599
facility learn about Department of

655
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,908
Agriculture rules and laws learn about

656
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:35,209
pesticide rules and laws learn about

657
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:37,159
basic greenhouse growing all of that

658
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,289
stuff will apply to cannabis and as

659
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,700
cannabis becomes a big industry you will

660
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:42,678
be ahead of the game when you've got

661
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,269
college degrees for that type of stuff

662
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,280
when it comes time to pay people and

663
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,960
decide who gets the bigger jobs that's

664
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:49,970
when you get those opportunities if

665
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,220
that's what you want to do I apologize

666
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,019
that I don't know which classes to tell

667
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,298
you to take or which schools to go to I

668
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:58,519
did not do that stuff that is a great

669
00:22:56,298 --> 00:23:00,650
way to segue into the second half of the

670
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,418
question you asked the second part of

671
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,580
the question is what steps did you take

672
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:06,530
when you first started breeding and

673
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:10,279
cultivating to have brought you to the

674
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:12,950
point where you are now you know I don't

675
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:15,379
think I saw this path ahead of me when I

676
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,539
started cultivating and breeding it all

677
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,970
happened in small steps just like it was

678
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,379
supposed to I don't talk about this a

679
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,909
lot and I'm not sure if I've ever said

680
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,830
this on the show but when I was a very

681
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:26,929
small child I had family members

682
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:29,928
illegally growing cannabis in our

683
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:31,309
backyard in California I its way long

684
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,350
ago nobody can get in trouble for that

685
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:34,069
[ __ ] now but I might have been seven or

686
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:36,168
eight years old

687
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:38,539
when I remember growing these plants and

688
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:41,090
I remember one of my uncles

689
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:42,950
telling my other uncle hey tonight

690
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:45,048
before it gets dark make sure you do

691
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,700
this to these plants and then he left my

692
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,918
uncle was like sure dude and the day

693
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,960
went on later on that evening it was

694
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,790
gonna get dark and my family was having

695
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,079
a conversation and my uncle said [ __ ] I

696
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,089
got to go out there and do these two the

697
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,369
weed plants and he said it wrong and I

698
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:00,048
said no dude he said to do this and

699
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:02,058
everybody looked at me and they said

700
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:04,490
[ __ ] he's right that's what they said to

701
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:05,928
do and so I kind of saved the crop is a

702
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,109
little kid I remember that kind of

703
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:10,640
vividly in my head and I wasn't allowed

704
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:11,928
to touch the plants then but I was out

705
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,549
there every time if they were out there

706
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:14,900
watering or doing something I was out

707
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:17,089
there with those ganja plants I was a

708
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,500
little tiny kid they probably tried to

709
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,359
keep me out of it but that was my house

710
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,279
that was my yard you know the little

711
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,629
kids just run [ __ ] you think that the

712
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,250
little kids are not running [ __ ] they

713
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,990
are they've got the ability and the

714
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,779
freedom to be all over the yard the

715
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,069
front yard the backyard the top of the

716
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:32,230
the back of a house because it doesn't

717
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:33,429
look weird if he was an adult go play in

718
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,809
that weird corner in the back of the

719
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,880
yard people notice you're their kids

720
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:38,139
nobody thinks it's weird so that yard

721
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,060
was mine but I remember they're like

722
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,980
seven I was like seven they were growing

723
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:45,009
weed way back then so that was like my

724
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,440
first step into cultivating and then I

725
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:49,869
was in another state where cannabis is

726
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,549
still illegal and I found out that a

727
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:52,899
friend was growing I accidentally

728
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,460
discovered his grow and I was like hey

729
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,230
bro I can see your grow and he was like

730
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,610
oh [ __ ] and then he was like well since

731
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,809
you saw it can you help me

732
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:00,129
he was like since you saw it you

733
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:01,779
obviously know what's going on because

734
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,400
it was pretty well hidden I spotted it

735
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,200
on accident he had a light leak I saw

736
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,580
the light leak it hit me in the eye and

737
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,960
I was like brothers a light leak right

738
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,339
there and he's like well should I need

739
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,279
help with these plants and so I helped

740
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:13,689
him then we harvested that together and

741
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,460
I used that experience that I had had

742
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,870
from my previous family members they

743
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,740
grew for quite a while I watched them

744
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:19,629
then I helped my buddy

745
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,000
then I was helping some friends with the

746
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,680
dispensary I'd been dabbling and growing

747
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,450
and I was talking about how I felt like

748
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,850
I had some better ideas than the grower

749
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,380
for that dispensary so they made me the

750
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:31,389
grower they're like okay then guess what

751
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,160
you grow now we fired him you take over

752
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,350
and I was like oh [ __ ] pressures on they

753
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,870
also gave me a bunch of equipment so I

754
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:40,959
set up some personal grows then that

755
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:42,909
compounded and expanded rapidly I became

756
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,470
known around my local town as the guy

757
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,300
that could solve the problems in your

758
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,559
grow if there was something wrong they

759
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:49,299
would call me they would come to the

760
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:50,769
dispensary where I worked they would say

761
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,269
after work I need you to come look at my

762
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:54,309
grower they would bring me pictures and

763
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:56,619
I would just politely help everybody

764
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,720
solve the problems in their gardens so I

765
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:01,239
got a very good reputation as being a

766
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,610
knowledgeable grower eventually that

767
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,200
dispensary was closed because of some

768
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:06,909
basically zoning reasons there are

769
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,610
dispensaries all around that bad [ __ ]

770
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,810
now but that was the very first

771
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,429
dispensary in my town it was myself and

772
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:14,619
some other friends they shut us down for

773
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,600
zoning white Mike was a big part of that

774
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:19,479
that is gone let's not dwell on that

775
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:22,059
place but that gave me a lot of exposure

776
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,670
and a lot of experience so I started off

777
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:26,799
as a young kid helping the family um I

778
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,019
evolved into helping and kind of taking

779
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,879
over a friend's grow in another state he

780
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:32,799
had an emergency he left I actually

781
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,440
finished his crop for him he came home

782
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,779
harvested a to cut it down we dried it

783
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,370
and cured it he split it with me that

784
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,190
was one of my first crops that I felt

785
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:44,589
like I kind of had a lot of control over

786
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,179
then I got my own grows going then I was

787
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:47,918
helping my friends with the dispensary

788
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:49,899
they kind of funded me with more gear I

789
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,600
got more grows going so at that point

790
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:54,278
I've had a few grows under my belt now

791
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:56,319
that I've got a dispensary grow to work

792
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:58,359
with and multiple personal growth of my

793
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,970
own to work with I'm getting a lot of

794
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:03,369
exposure to these plants to their

795
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,899
problems to their cycles I've got a lot

796
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:06,428
of rooms to play with now I'm getting

797
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:08,979
friends having me come over and look at

798
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,600
crops I made quite a reputation and had

799
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,089
quite a nice little following around

800
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:15,099
here when one of the larger dispensaries

801
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,109
was rebuilding their facility and they

802
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:20,079
called me and asked me to partner with

803
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:22,058
them I got to work with an architect and

804
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,500
an HVAC person and a whole bunch of

805
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:25,509
different people involved with the city

806
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,819
and building codes and I learned a

807
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:30,159
tremendous amount about building a

808
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:32,589
cultivation facility and working with

809
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,600
all of those contractors and licensing

810
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:36,668
people there was a lot to think about in

811
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,558
a lot to work with in that process

812
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:40,990
I learned a tremendous amount there and

813
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:41,528
got paid in that process so that was a

814
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,599
gift

815
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:45,700
eventually I parted ways with that

816
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,378
facility there were just some personal

817
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,659
issues I didn't get along with the owner

818
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:50,980
we are different kinds of people that is

819
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:53,649
all I need to say about that we were

820
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,750
completely different types of people I

821
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:57,969
have no problem with who he is he has no

822
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:00,099
problem with Who I am we just see things

823
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,230
differently so we don't work together so

824
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:04,418
I moved on I took over another grow in

825
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:09,099
another location and in that grow

826
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:12,038
I pulled 314 pounds out of 100 lights so

827
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:14,949
I was pulling 3.14 pounds per light I

828
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:16,419
was really gaining momentum there I got

829
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,940
really good at commercial cultivation

830
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:20,980
there I trained another staff at that

831
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,889
facility and then I moved on to another

832
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,929
place where I had a nice staff I had a

833
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:29,048
really large facility we built another

834
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:30,970
facility next door in the build of that

835
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:33,038
next facility I got to see and

836
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:35,048
participate in a lot of the work and a

837
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,240
lot of the meetings I got to learn a lot

838
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:39,369
again about HVAC installation about

839
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,230
sizing HVAC I got to learn a lot about

840
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:45,069
electricity I got to learn about

841
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:47,349
commercial cultivation construction the

842
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:49,480
planning I've seen all aspects of it

843
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:51,069
from the idea in somebody's head to

844
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,929
finding investors how to get the money

845
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:55,000
to do it to getting people to simply

846
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:56,140
believe in you to get it done - getting

847
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,240
the lawyers the

848
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,100
towns the city people the state people

849
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,109
the marijuana Enforcement Division the

850
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:03,759
Department of Ag the people who need to

851
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:05,109
put more electricity on that pole you

852
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,940
get to get all of them in the same room

853
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:08,979
I've been there for all of that silly

854
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,990
[ __ ] it is a struggle it's a challenge

855
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,759
but I am so blessed that I've been

856
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,440
involved in all of that because every

857
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:16,900
one of those little things is a step

858
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,630
that has gotten me to where I am now so

859
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,310
I saw that small facility expand to

860
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,690
become a larger facility I got to lead

861
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:24,609
that team I got to learn about

862
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:27,250
commercial drying and curing

863
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:28,569
I all of it I've seen all aspects of it

864
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,240
before I was even in the commercial

865
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:33,009
growing part I was a budtender doing the

866
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,470
over-the-counter part so I got to see

867
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:37,480
that aspect as well then I started doing

868
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,339
consulting for many other commercial

869
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,650
facilities so I have walked into many

870
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:43,329
facilities and seen how many places are

871
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,400
built I can walk in and tell you what's

872
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:48,369
wrong with the facility I can improve

873
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,920
your cultivation by 30 percent within a

874
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,699
certain amount of time guaranteed that's

875
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,590
what I do

876
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,450
so it's been many steps to get to where

877
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:57,639
I am today it hasn't just been like a

878
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,440
hey this happened it took a lot of steps

879
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,930
so that is kind of how the commercial

880
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,059
grow part of my career developed the

881
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,680
breeding was just passion you said that

882
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:08,409
you had a passion for the plants earlier

883
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,660
I simply have a fascination and a

884
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,400
passion for breeding cannabis I was

885
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,440
growing these plants for a long time I

886
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,030
started buying seeds like most of us do

887
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,890
we trade clones with our friends we get

888
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:20,500
plants from here and there and then you

889
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,710
start seeing that they're all seventh

890
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,730
out of ten and you want an 11 as a

891
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,140
passionate grower I don't want to grow

892
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,180
sevens I don't want to grow eight so I

893
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,310
want to grow [ __ ] out leavens all day

894
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,320
so I thought the only way I'm gonna get

895
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:34,990
anything better is if I order new seeds

896
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,970
and get new [ __ ] in so I got seeds I was

897
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,130
getting eights and nines didn't find any

898
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,870
tins or 11s I was like ah there's

899
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,000
something close here I'm just not where

900
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:44,319
I want to be and then a couple of my

901
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,759
friends were like bro it's not too far

902
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,589
before you start breeding and I was like

903
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,960
it's not happening I like growing I'm

904
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:51,849
focused on this then I was like you know

905
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,110
what I like this plant I like this plan

906
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:54,639
a lot it's really time to start doing

907
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:56,379
some pollen chuckit and I started

908
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,900
breeding my intention was to make seeds

909
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,060
for myself I made a bunch of seeds for

910
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,710
myself I started growing them some of my

911
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,059
friends were like bro that is awesome

912
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,769
can I have some and so I was giving

913
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:07,809
seeds away I went to a couple of

914
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:09,778
cannabis cups in Denver and I gave away

915
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:11,428
probably 5000 seeds over

916
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:13,288
two events just passing out packs of

917
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:15,749
five and ten seeds to friends and random

918
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:17,460
people and strangers and smokers anyone

919
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,839
who I saw with nutrients if they had a

920
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,819
bag of nutrients like they bought

921
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,918
nutrients or were given a nutrient

922
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:24,418
package at the show I gave them seeds

923
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,739
now you've got seeds to grow with those

924
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,840
nutrients it was a sign that they're a

925
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:31,048
grower I spread a bunch of seeds

926
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:33,598
um you can't expect to just start a seed

927
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:35,878
company it takes a lot of time to

928
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:37,678
develop a brand you have to develop

929
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:39,538
seeds those seeds have to grow people

930
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,298
have to see that it is something worth

931
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:44,579
growing you have to create demand mostly

932
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:46,168
it has to just be a quality product and

933
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:48,388
that comes from me being passionate I

934
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:51,179
keep going back to that passion the

935
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:54,358
cultivation part the knowledge the

936
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:56,759
experience that commercial aspect of my

937
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:59,038
career that all came from experience

938
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,588
from slow baby steps and exposure and

939
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,058
also doing a good [ __ ] job I talked

940
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:05,608
about the way to get into the industry

941
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:08,489
is to go be a trimmer or just show up

942
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:10,618
showing up is the first step show up so

943
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:11,909
I started off and show that I could do

944
00:32:10,618 --> 00:32:13,408
it I was like man I can help you

945
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:15,210
transplant and I transplant like a

946
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,830
champion and then one day they needed

947
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,999
help bud tinning and I bud tendon

948
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:19,408
they're like dude you're good at that

949
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:20,700
and then eventually I ended up with the

950
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:23,278
keys to the whole facility it was

951
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,259
basically mine so baby steps get you

952
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,940
going showing that you give a [ __ ]

953
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:28,618
that'll get you there and it's like

954
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,088
going to martial arts or playing an

955
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:31,528
instrument or something you got to start

956
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:32,668
off learning your rudiments and then one

957
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:34,499
day you're doing paradiddles with your

958
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:35,969
feet or if you're doing karate you start

959
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:37,588
off they start you off in karate just

960
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:38,669
throw on the left punch Right punch left

961
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,719
punch right punch

962
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:41,879
ten years later you're [ __ ] doing

963
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:43,320
back flips and spin kicks it all starts

964
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:46,199
off in baby steps so that's how the

965
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:48,450
career aspect of my life got going then

966
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,788
the breeding the seed part that is all

967
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,190
passion that is just my love for growing

968
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:54,719
for breeding when you breed some seeds

969
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,028
and then you've got a handful of seeds

970
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:58,440
the real excitement isn't growing those

971
00:32:57,028 --> 00:33:00,719
you get to see what you just created

972
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,489
that I just make the next chem dog did I

973
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:04,229
just make a bunch of duds did I make

974
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:06,419
something that tastes magical did I make

975
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:08,278
really amazing medicine for my friends

976
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,809
that are sick that I make something that

977
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,999
is totally a piece of [ __ ] I got to

978
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:14,219
throw it away that is so much fun to

979
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:16,288
find out it's a very similar feeling to

980
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:17,970
opening Christmas presents or even

981
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,858
better it's like opening up a pakka

982
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,048
a package of baseball cards or I guess

983
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:23,659
it's 2020 so they're [ __ ] pokemon

984
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:25,190
cards are Magic the Gathering car

985
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,620
now and you're looking to see what you

986
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,970
got but in cannabis plants you've got to

987
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:30,649
wait a little while so you got to make

988
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,880
the seeds and then you got to grow them

989
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,170
out and you get to watch and while

990
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,940
they're vegging you're paying attention

991
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,110
that one's a little taller that one's

992
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,910
kind of stretchy er that one's got some

993
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:39,859
crazy leaves and then when you start

994
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,180
flowering them it gets exciting you pull

995
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:42,379
out all the boys you're like Tim and I

996
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,000
was hoping that one was a girl cuz it

997
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,070
was pretty and then about week five

998
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,410
you're like oh look at the buds on this

999

1002
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:55,309
you're like look what I did there's a

1003
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,990
bunch of duds but it's so much fun and

1004
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,220
that's that all that passion that you

1005
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,170
can hear in my voice when it comes to

1006
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,600
talking about a Fino hunt of seeds that

1007
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:05,420
I have bred that is what got me here

1008
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:08,599
always staying passionate always loving

1009
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,639
that plant and always breeding for what

1010
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,809
I felt was right and not just doing it

1011
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,480
for something that I thought would be

1012
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:16,400
some kind of hype yes I was asked one

1013
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,440
time to make a strain by another

1014
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,720
professional breeder and his idea was

1015
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,579
[ __ ] a hit it went very well for me

1016
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,619
so I'm glad that he kind of recommended

1017
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:27,168
or asked me to do that favor cuz in my

1018
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:28,730
career that did help me quite well so

1019
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:30,799
he's doing things that I thought were

1020
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,690
right just following my heart following

1021
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,760
my head try not to screw anybody over

1022
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:36,860
try not to do anything from my ego or

1023
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,630
from my wallet or anything like that or

1024
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,669
for Hyper for fame just doing it because

1025
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,950
I love it that seems to be what kept me

1026
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:44,929
moving forward and kept me in this game

1027
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,699
for so long and honestly right now I

1028
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:48,650
feel like I'm at a high point and I'm

1029
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,779
just going up I've never felt like my

1030
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:53,119
company like I read genetics has had so

1031
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,919
much momentum before it has until this

1032
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,019
exact moment and I feel like it just

1033
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,210
gets stronger and stronger every day and

1034
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:01,099
then where that commercial side and that

1035
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:04,070
breeding site meet is I get the ability

1036
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:06,409
to run large batches of plants large

1037
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:08,420
populations in other people's facilities

1038
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:10,399
and see what they do that also gives me

1039
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,960
access to many plants so that's where

1040
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,300
the commercial and the breeder and the

1041
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,010
passion side kind of combine and I also

1042
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,050
believe in that phrase that people say

1043
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,580
if you love your job you don't work a

1044
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,070
day in your life or something like that

1045
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:25,099
I love what I'm doing and it shows how

1046
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,780
business owners grow owners dispensary

1047
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:29,000
owners they can tell when I show up that

1048
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,490
I'm excited and eager to get there grow

1049
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,440
going top notch and they see it in just

1050
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:35,449
a few days just a couple of weeks I

1051
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,860
start turning the grill around so that

1052
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:39,199
passion that

1053
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,940
Ariane's has gotten me a long way so let

1054
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,829
me recap cuz it you did ask a question I

1055
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,809
just got off on a long rant I am not

1056
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:46,940
sure what to recommend for schooling I

1057
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,590
would say stay in business school that's

1058
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,440
going to get you the farthest in my

1059
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:53,750
opinion then you ask what steps did I

1060
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,490
take I didn't know it at the time but

1061
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,900
the steps were presented to me I don't

1062
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:59,549
know what you believe in I don't talk

1063
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:03,150
about that sort of stuff on the show

1064
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:04,800
I follow Rastafari I think that job put

1065
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,630
those steps in front of me and I was

1066
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,700
wise enough to take the opportunities

1067
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,470
that were presented and by doing what I

1068
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,509
thought was right I ended up right where

1069
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:13,709
I feel like I am supposed to be all

1070
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,360
