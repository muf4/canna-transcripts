all right let's do move forward i did

130
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,318
say that i had some grow

131
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,120
lessons we were going to talk a little

132
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,798
bit about watering plants

133
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
um i've been working with a couple of

134
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,599
other people i may be teaching people

135
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,200
how to water some plants we don't need

136
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,798
to go into too many details about that

137
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,479
but as i was teaching people to water

138
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,239
these plants

139
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,399
basically what i did was i went to their

140
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,358
grow and i just stood around and watched

141
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,679
them do their thing

142
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,120
i kind of acted aloof a little bit i

143
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,478
looked like i was on my phone i looked

144
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,560
like i was distracted that was an

145
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,000
appearance that i gave on purpose

146
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,439
they got comfortable in their grow

147
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
environment and they did their day in

148
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,519
the grow

149
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
and i just kind of watched and they

150
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,639
didn't know i was watching in such

151
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,159
detail but i took a few notes on the

152
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,439
phone wrote down some ideas

153
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,600
thought of ways we can improve their

154
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,879
grow that's what i was there for so one

155
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,160
of the things i really noticed that

156
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,839
these people were doing

157
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,479
that they could improve upon i noticed

158
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,799
right away is they are watering the very

159
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,319
center of their plants it doesn't matter

160
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,919
what size container you've got if you've

161
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,639
got 1 gallon 2 gallon

162
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,319
3 gallons 50 gallons it doesn't matter

163
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,960
what size your container is

164
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,639
it is not ideal to water just the center

165
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,478
part of that plant maybe when that plant

166
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,918
is a baby when it's new

167
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,519
when it's just getting established and

168
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,519
doesn't have a big root system

169
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,839
it's okay to water that inner inner uh

170
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,519
circle there but once the plant grows

171
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,239
then we're going to water want to water

172
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,918
the outer

173
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,439
part of that plant the roots are only

174
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,719
going to grow where there is water it's

175
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,279
going to look they're going to look for

176
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,560
water

177
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,319
but if they don't find water they're

178
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,759
just going to die and those ends are

179
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,599
that's where the roots end is where the

180
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
water doesn't go

181
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,840
so if we do water these plants at the

182
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,359
outer edge a little bit more the roots

183
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,918
will grow out that way we will get

184
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,038
bigger

185
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,799
bigger roots bigger healthier roots in

186
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,639
some ways do translate to bigger

187
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
healthier fruits that is

188
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,680
kind of a good catchphrase it's not a

189
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,478
hundred percent accurate because i can

190
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,959
grow you

191
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,719
big ass plants in tiny pots and a hydro

192
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,599
system but if you do have big fat

193
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,120
healthy roots

194
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
your plants will be more healthy they

195
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,360
can eat better they could cycle better

196
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,478
uh you can get a longer wet and dry time

197
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
so if you want to go away for the

198
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,399
weekend you can water them down you can

199
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
leave

200
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,439
anyway you want a bigger root system you

201
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,639
want to water uh

202
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,680
instead of just watering right in the

203
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,120
middle because i was watching these

204
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,639
people walk up to their pot they'd get

205
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,759
their watering container and just pour

206
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,240
it right in the middle

207
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,840
and i was like you maybe hit like 30 of

208
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,120
the root zone of that plant the water's

209
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,038
going right down the middle of that pot

210
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,639
it's not spreading out maybe it is

211
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,159
through gravity in the way that it flows

212
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,639
but it would have been more ideal

213
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,919
to water the whole top part of that

214
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,600
plant and let it soak all the way down

215
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,038
do apologize for the raspy voice i

216
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
promise that didn't happen until i

217
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:25,360
pressed record today and then i got the

218
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,120
raspiness

219
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,879
we're gonna fight right through that so

220
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,160
uh water the outer part of the plant not

221
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,439
just the newer plant

222
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
as the plants are growing if they're

223
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,000
brand new absolutely you do just have to

224
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,599
water that inner

225
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,519
part that's where the plant is but if

226
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,520
you've got the appropriate pot size for

227
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,439
your plant and for its roots

228
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,279
you should be watering most of that root

229
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,120
zone most of that soil zone

230
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,719
so don't just water the center water the

231
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,959
outside if you think about it the plants

232
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,520
are

233
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,120
shaped like an umbrella so if you think

234
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,959
about it the rain would come down

235
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,399
and the leaves would hit the rain would

236
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,000
hit the top leaves and it would spread

237
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,598
it out wider and then it would go down

238
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,879
and spread it out wider and go down and

239
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,319
spread it out wider that's how the

240
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,038
leaves are shaped they kind of taper

241
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,720
outward

242
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,240
in a tier system just like we build a

243
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,759
roof just the way we put the shingles on

244
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,319
the roof the water has to flow a certain

245
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,560
way

246
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,319
the leaves are already doing that that's

247
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,439
probably where we got the idea of how to

248
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,598
lay the shingles

249
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,478
so the plant the rain will hit the water

250
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,598
the water will drip

251
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,359
outward and then if you look at the

252
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,439
ground where it rains there will be a

253
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
big circle of water around your plant

254
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,639
right under the plant

255
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,000
didn't even get watered because unless

256
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,038
water flowed into there but it was

257
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,879
protected from

258
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,639
the plant it didn't get hit underneath

259
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,240
but all around it is all wet and all

260
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,360
that root zone in that big circle is

261
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
getting wet so

262
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
if you think about it the plants do want

263
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,840
water at that outer edge they're shaped

264
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,478
like an umbrella

265
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,598
so let's get water to that outer edge

266
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,318
then here are some things that will

267
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,719
happen

268
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,000
your plant will branch out more it won't

269
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,759
think it's in a little tiny

270
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,038
zone and it will branch out more it'll

271
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,400
get more branching it'll get more

272
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,038
activity it will get more

273
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,799
growth also i noticed that these people

274
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,800
had their plants in too small

275
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,038
of a pot uh those plants weren't going

276
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,879
to grow very big and they weren't

277
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,560
they probably were in the right size pot

278
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,120
because they weren't watering enough

279
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
uh to get them to fill the pot but i

280
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,160
would recommend a larger pot than what

281
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,759
they were using because their plants are

282
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,120
going to get root bound which is another

283
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,840
thing that was causing their plants to

284
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,519
get tall

285
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,959
and lanky their plants were very tall

286
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,359
and skinny so if we water

287
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,799
more space to water more space for roots

288
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,280
those plants are going to grow wider if

289
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,360
you've got

290
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,038
the root base tucked into a little tiny

291
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,639
coffee can they're going to get tall and

292
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,759
skinny if you put into a bigger pot

293
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,720
they're going to get wider they'll have

294
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,479
more root space

295
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,919
they'll feel more comfortable getting

296
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,598
larger um

297
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,359
also their plants were too close

298
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,200
together which wasn't too big of a deal

299
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,560
because they were tall and lanky

300
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,800
uh they had a bunch of fish and pole

301
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,718
plants going on um

302
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,439
they were too pressed together too tall

303
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,680
and lanky and in too small of a pot

304
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,959
they were starting to autoflower because

305
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,479
they were so upset

306
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,919
they were too close together some of the

307
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,519
lower stuff wasn't getting light they

308
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,120
didn't clean up any of the bottoms that

309
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,799
stuff was starting to autoflower

310
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,159
they were pressed so close together the

311
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,159
light wasn't getting down

312
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,159
uh into the canopy but having those

313
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,000
plants pressed so closely together

314
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,759
and not cleaning up the bottoms of them

315
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,958
was making them go into flour and the

316
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,559
roots haven't even filled these

317
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,479
containers yet so it's way early to

318
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,919
flower these plants and it was way early

319
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,680
for them to be so tall so uh these

320
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,519
plants were going into flour

321
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,199
uh they were not ready to flower they

322
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,959
were not healthy they were too tall

323
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
so the things we can start with is water

324
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,838
that outer edge then another thing we

325
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,680
can do is make sure

326
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,880
to have our plants far enough apart

327
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,000
where they can grow and get some

328
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,360
branching on them

329
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
then another thing we should do is make

330
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,278
sure to up pot at the right time

331
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,640
uh to prevent that early flowering

332
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,799
because once they do get

333
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,399
uh root bound they can go into flower

334
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,519
early on you all right i've got a lot of

335
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
notes in front of me i'm gonna make sure

336
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,080
i covered them

337
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,240
i feel like i covered that section quite

338
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,759
quickly i hit all the bullet points i've

339
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
got here let's move on

340
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,958
to a grow question that came from my

341
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,080
friend brohan

342
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:50,958
78 on patreon again that is patreon.com

343
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,120
forward slash grow from your heart

344
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,799
this one says hey ross to jeff i was

345
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,080
wondering something i recently grew your

346
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,519
golden goat fans

347
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,600
oh you're a very lucky person those

348
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,759
golden goat feminist seeds are sold out

349
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,000
i have and will be sold out for a short

350
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,759
time they will be back but right now

351
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,679
you're a lucky person to have those it

352
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,480
says they came out beautifully by the

353
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,479
way

354
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,519
ah thank you and that's a good work to

355
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,278
you i made good seeds

356
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,799
you had to grow them took you nine

357
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,480
probably 12 weeks to get that whole

358
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,120
project completed maybe more

359
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,680
good job you did all the hard work so it

360
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,879
says i found one perfect looking seed

361
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,039
and a bud

362
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,278
there were no males around at all would

363
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,078
this seed even be viable

364
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,159
thank you all right so i've said this

365
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,679
several times on several shows before

366
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,600
i'm not blaming you nothing for not

367
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,639
hearing it but this is my theory on how

368
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,519
this works

369
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,240
uh plants are a lot like jurassic park

370
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
nature

371
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,399
finds a way the number one goal for our

372
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,240
plants

373
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,078
ah we have a lot of ideas and a lot of

374
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,680
goals for them we want to grow them and

375
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:50,879
pop and twist them and defoliate them we

376
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,319
want to smoke them and we want them to

377
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,320
get us high and we want to turn it into

378
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,360
concentrates or baked goods or whatever

379
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,519
this plant has one main goal in its own

380
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,519
mind and that is to reproduce

381
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,879
to make seeds for the next season that

382
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,839
is your plant's whole goal if it's a

383
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,679
female plant

384
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,000
it wants to get seeded if it's a male

385
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,559
plant it wants to do some pollinating

386
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,759
so that is the main goal of this plant

387
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,879
these plants will

388
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,679
find a way to survive so it is not

389
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,439
uncommon

390
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,278
for these plants to kind of just throw

391
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,880
one or two random seeds some people will

392
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,480
call it a stress seed some people will

393
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,200
call it a herm seed

394
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,800
if you don't see any intersex flowers on

395
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,920
that plant then it's nothing to worry

396
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,599
about

397
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,000
sometimes a plant will make a seed

398
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
because it is striving to survive

399
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
oftentimes this is because the plant

400
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
went a little bit longer than it should

401
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,720
have but if you've got one

402
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,078
fully developed perfect looking seed

403
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,839
that seed happened early in the

404
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,599
flowering process

405
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,440
and that that bud just that plant just

406
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,000
knew i'm really good bud and we have to

407
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,839
continue so it made a seed it is natural

408
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
life does find a way

409
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,040
uh it's the jurassic park theory is what

410
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
i call it and i think i borrowed that

411
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,078
from james bean so shout out to my buddy

412
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
james bean if that is where i learned

413
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,078
the jurassic park theory

414
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
so what is happening here is basically

415
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,199
uh life will find a way there are a few

416
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
things that could cause this it could

417
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,680
have been stress

418
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
uh it could have been some intersex

419
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,919
trait it could have just been

420
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,679
uh life finding a way there's another

421
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,519
thing known as i'm going to say it wrong

422
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,599
because i didn't google the word before

423
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,799
rotalization road i think it's

424
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,879
rotalization

425
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,958
anyway what it is is uh growing the

426
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,639
plant longer than it needed to flower

427
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,479
and then that will make the plant make

428
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,919
seeds uh it doesn't sound like you did

429
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
that because you probably didn't know

430
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,278
the seed was in there you probably just

431
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,720
harvested your normal buds and you're

432
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,000
grinding up a bowl one day and heard

433
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,600
tink tink in the grinder and went oh

434
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,639
dude i got a seed in here

435
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,120
um so we call that a gift that is a gift

436
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,799
that is a free bc the follow-up is

437
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,879
uh there were no males around at all

438
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,639
yeah uh that's just the life will find a

439
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,159
way the will to survive then it says

440
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,879
would this seed even be

441
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,958
viable thanks for your help hey my

442
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,759
friend brohan 78 thank you for the great

443
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,879
question this is a good springboard for

444
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,919
some rambling here this seed if it looks

445
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,600
perfect

446
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,679
uh the only way to find out if it is

447
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,440
viable is to grow it

448
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,879
does it sprout let's see what happens

449
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,440
then veg it up

450
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,320
take a clone of it because you may have

451
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,160
the next

452
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,760
champion plant this could be something

453
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,278
amazing this could be better than the

454
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,600
original golden goat this could blow

455
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,078
golden goat out of the water

456
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,120
or this could be complete trash this

457
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,559
could just be

458
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,159
something with nanners on it this could

459
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,599
just be a totally freaky mutant plant

460
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,519
that you want to throw away

461
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,200
but it could be amazing this is how a

462
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,200
lot of famous strains were created we're

463
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
going to talk about that in a minute but

464
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,399
get a clone of this plant flower it out

465
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,160
see what it does

466
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,278
smoke it with your friends maybe you

467
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,838
don't even need to smoke it with that

468
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:37,039
maybe you're

469
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,880
halfway through growing it you're going

470
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,559
to say look it's nothing but trichomes

471
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,919
it's just a trichome tree maybe that's

472
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,198
what you've got maybe it's charlie

473
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,719
brown's christmas tree

474
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,479
and you'll know three weeks into flower

475
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,240
that it's a winner or a loser

476
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,000
but grow it out finish it up see what it

477
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,159
does um

478
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,559
what you technically have would be

479
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,120
labeled bag seed don't call it golden

480
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
goat

481
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,039
just say it's golden goat bag seed that

482
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,078
means it came from a bag of golden goat

483
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,759
and it is a seed

484
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,359
that we don't know why that seed

485
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,319
happened we know it came from golden

486
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,000
goat buds

487
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,839
so we know the female was golden goat

488
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
but we don't know why that seed happened

489
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,120
so we can't label it

490
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,120
with a full-on name that's not an

491
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
a-grade seed because we don't know the

492
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,959
full pedigree of that

493
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
so you've got a bag seed it could be

494
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,399
anything it could be

495
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,919
amazing it could be trash let's talk

496
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,720
about a few strains that i

497
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,838
feel happened this way or in a similar

498
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,959
manner

499
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,199
i feel the original golden goat actually

500
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,078
was an accident it was not supposed to

501
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,078
be bread

502
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,679
a guy had a male plant and he had a

503
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,198
female plant and they actually it wasn't

504
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,319
me i did not breed the original golden

505
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,078
goat by the way let me clear that up

506
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,040
that was made by mr dank in topeka

507
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,278
kansas

508
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,759
but uh mr dank's male plant got away

509
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,278
from him it pollinated his female plant

510
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,958
he found some seeds in there when he was

511
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,198
smoking it or i don't know if he was

512
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,958
smoking or what but he found the seeds

513
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,319
that became the golden goat that was an

514
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,879
accident

515
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,000
so that was technically bag seed that's

516
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,000
the same scenario

517
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,839
which you've got accidental seed it

518
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
became golden go which is

519
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
world renowned it's a famous [ __ ]

520
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,839
strain that see those seeds sell out

521
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,760
every seed i make sells out immediately

522
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,480
so that's a very famous strain and it

523
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,278
was made by

524
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,199
accident gorilla glue was made by

525
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,480
accident it's another one of the world's

526
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,479
most famous strains

527
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,519
it's sought after all of the seeds of

528
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,680
gorilla glue get

529
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,600
sold people claim to have gorilla glue

530
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,958
crosses that they don't have it's clone

531
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,560
only

532
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,000
just like the golden goat until we made

533
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,399
it into femme seeds

534
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,679
uh but anyway i digress that one is

535
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,519
another accident

536
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,239
we've got the cookies the girl scout

537
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,919
cookies i suspect i cannot prove

538
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,759
but i don't think girl scout cookies was

539
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,519
really made with anything on purpose or

540
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,959
we would know what it was people would

541
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
somebody would come forward and say it

542
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,000
was this

543
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,199
cross to this i did it in this basement

544
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,879
somebody would say that

545
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,559
instead it shrouded with mystery which

546
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,320
makes me think it was an accidental bag

547
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,838
seed that somebody found and they grew

548
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,519
and they found a gem just like you

549
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,880
possibly have in there

550
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,000
let's talk about something else we

551
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,078
should mention all of the chem dog line

552
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
everything that came from chem dog

553
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,479
genetics started

554
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,120
with bag seed i always talk a little bit

555
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,519
about

556
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,440
chem dog and the legend of the 13 beans

557
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,120
i'm not going to go too deep into it

558
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,320
i don't have any notes i just decided

559
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
right now that i would kind of update

560
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
you on the chem dog story there was a

561
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,399
guy

562
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,240
he wasn't known as kim dog yet we're not

563
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,159
going to say his name um

564
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
he went to some grateful dead shows and

565
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,480
he met up with some guys

566
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,680
named aj and peabud and aj and peabud

567
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,600
were growing some weed

568
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,679
that they called dog bud they called it

569
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,639
dog bud because when you smoked on it

570
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,559
you smoked it

571
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,480
uh you rolled over on your back like a

572
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,919
dog they called it the dog bud

573
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
some of their friends were calling it

574
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,120
the chem wheat because it smelled like

575
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,799
chemicals they were asking what kind of

576
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,278
chemicals they grew it with this is the

577
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:48,719
best of my recollection of this story

578
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,759
so peabud and joe were growing

579
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,120
we're getting i don't know if they were

580
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,079
growing it or getting it i don't know

581
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,120
that part they were getting the dog bud

582
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,799
they uh were calling it dog bud because

583
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,399
it would make you stone like a dog you

584
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,000
lay on you roll over on your back like a

585
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,958
dog or they were calling it the chem

586
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
weed because their friend said it

587
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,159
smelled like chemicals

588
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
that kind of spawns the name chemdog

589
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,558
right there they were not putting a w

590
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,798
in it it was chem dog with an o so all

591
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,879
of us that are using the w

592
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,240
we're doing it wrong old school chem dog

593
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,919
with an o not with a w

594
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,519
so uh these guys run into a guy

595
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,240
uh whose name will be left out of the

596
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,959
story at a grateful dead concert at deer

597
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,199
creek so

598
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,960
he buys some weed from him he realizes

599
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,600
this weed's [ __ ] fire

600
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,798
they exchange numbers uh grateful dead

601
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,599
tour ends

602
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,119
uh peabud and joe go back to colorado

603
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,719
allegedly breckenridge is where i think

604
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,759
this where they were from

605
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,038
um the guy who later becomes kem dog

606
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,879
goes back to his place

607
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,200
he contacts them later says i want some

608
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,799
herb ah

609
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,160
they teleported them some wheat now they

610
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:51,440
[ __ ] mailed it to him allegedly

611
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,720
probably i don't know exactly how that

612
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,919
happened they got him

613
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,000
uh so the boys in colorado allegedly got

614
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,200
the man who later became kem dog they

615
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,798
got him some product

616
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
uh there was allegedly i've heard two

617
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,519
different stories i heard there were

618
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,558
three ounces i heard there were four

619
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,558
ounces

620
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,000
um if anybody wants to chime in

621
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,678
somewhere and let me know that

622
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,359
i'm all about it i want to get this

623
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,480
story right and i just now decided to

624
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,399
tell you so i'm trying to remember the

625
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,200
best i can from memory

626
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,400
so these guys get herb to the man who

627
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,679
becomes chem dog

628
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
chem dog finds 13 seeds in this bag of

629
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,400
weed in the

630
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,600
all three ounces or four ounces however

631
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,480
many he got

632
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,359
there were 13 seeds he sprouted some of

633
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,759
them

634
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,079
some of them were males they got removed

635
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,879
i've heard him talk on future podcasts

636
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,759
uh no i can't hear him talk on future

637
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
podcasts

638
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,440
but after this story i heard him talk on

639
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,558
podcast that was

640
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,480
i knew what i meant you knew what i

641
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,720
meant i heard him talk on podcasts where

642
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,240
he said i wish i knew what i was doing

643
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,319
with those males because now i kick

644
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,839
myself for calling those males

645
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,918
yeah bro me too those males were

646
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,678
probably [ __ ] amazing so the kim dog

647
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,600
males got tossed there were

648
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,440
all the females that he found he kept i

649
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,079
think he may have more seeds according

650
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,160
to the legend of kim dog in the 13 beans

651
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:08,960
of those 13 beans we got the chem 91

652
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,640
i'm going to guess he popped that in 91

653
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,558
we got the chem d

654
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,160
which had a lot of i'm not exactly sure

655
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,720
why it got called kim d but it had a lot

656
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,360
of that

657
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,000
tennis ball uh chemical sort of a smell

658
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,240
to it

659
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,160
uh the chem 91 was skunkier in my

660
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
opinion that's my favorite is the skunky

661
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,798
one

662
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,360
the chem d is kind of gassier in tennis

663
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,879
balls uh then there's the kem's sister

664
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,319
and there are other chems that came from

665
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,760
that i should have done research but the

666
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,558
top three that you'll know

667
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,839
are the chem 91 uh the chem d and the

668
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,279
kim's sister i don't know if there was

669
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,000
one that was just straight called chem

670
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,119
dog

671
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,279
but that is chem dog is the guy who

672
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,479
found those seeds in a bag of weed and

673
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,798
he grew them

674
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,880
now we're calling the weed chem dog and

675
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,440
there's a guy known as chem dog from

676
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,240
some seeds that came from bags of weed

677
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,640
what you've got is bag seed you could

678
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,599
have the next chem dog you could be

679
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,520
the guy of legend of the golden goat s1

680
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,480
and the one bean that could be you

681
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,000
right now or you could have trash that

682
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,120
you should throw away at week four

683
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,919
but that is my recollection of randomly

684
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,839
decidingly

685
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,840
deciding to tell you the legend of kem

686
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,720
dog in the 13 beans there were two guys

687
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,079
in colorado

688
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,240
they had some herb they were calling it

689
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,359
the dog weed uh they met a guy at a

690
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,440
grateful dead show

691
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,678
they became friends later on they got

692
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,240
him some of the herb he found 13 seeds

693
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,960
those 13 seeds netted us some of the

694
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,640
most

695
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,720
uh prolific influential cannabis in our

696
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
uh catalog in our gene pool in our

697
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,120
[ __ ] culture everybody knows what kem

698
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,600
dog is

699
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,479
everybody knows about chem d everybody's

700
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,158
smoked chem

701
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,400
chem dog you hear about it it's

702
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,039
legendary so that is where it came from

703
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,159
it was

704
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,839
bag seed uh recently i had a friend say

705
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,799
dude have you shopped at this dispensary

706
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,918
and i was like no i don't really shop

707
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,400
there and he's like they have a shelf

708
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,240
that

709
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,759
it's all seeded but the wheat is super

710
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,960
good but it's got a few seeds in it and

711
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,319
i was like how many seeds are in he's

712
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,880
like you get like one or two seeds in

713
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,480
eighth

714
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,840
and i did the math i got how much is an

715
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,360
ounce and he told me i go bro just go

716
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,798
buy an ounce and hope you get 10 seeds

717
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,240
in there that's like buying a [ __ ]

718
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:05,679
pack of killer seeds if you grow that

719
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,798
you're gonna find fire in there and he's

720
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,400
like really bro

721
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,000
and i was like those are free seeds bro

722
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,519
go get those most people are gonna be

723
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,519
mad but go buy an ounce and

724
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,558
hope you get a 12 pack of free seeds

725
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,720
it'll be worth it

726
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,798
that's what the out the price of an

727
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,319
ounce is what a 10 or 12 pack of seeds

728
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,839
would cost you on the market

729
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,359
and then basically he's getting an ounce

730
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,399
of shitty weed to go with it that's the

731
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,719
way i thought about it

732
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,440
told him go get an ounce of that weed

733
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,440
anyway

734
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,798
i digress i'm rambling i'm not sure how

735
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,159
long i've been going but

736
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:33,440

737
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,200

744
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,359
