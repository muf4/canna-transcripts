wasn't completely level I'm not

101
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:57,359
complaining but I found a table that I

102
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,079
felt comfortable putting my rig on there

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,799

138
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,038
started but honestly um come bombard the

139
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,199
table get get early get there early get

140
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,680
the best seeds I'm not shy about it but

141
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,800
here's what Mike and I noticed about

142
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,360
11:15 I pulled out my rig I put water in

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,360
that rig about 11:45 I found my Banger

144
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,800
and attached that to the rig about 12:30

145
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,680
I finally found my carb cap around 1:00

146
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,038
I found the dab right I think it was

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,360
approximately 2:30 p.m. before my booth

148
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:38,478
slowed down before it was finally time

149
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,560
for me to be able to take a big fat dab

150
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,159
so I'm not complaining but we got into

151
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,680
the dgc cup around 10: uh we got set up

152
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,120
around 10:30 or 11: I scooped up a dab

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,280
and people started showing up at the

154
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,439
booth by 11:15 11:30 we were swamped and

155
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,359
I did not get to take a breath until

156
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,199
approximately 2:30 p.m. so for 3 or 4

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
hours there we were completely busting

158
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,879
completely busy uh I loved it it was a

159
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,520
good time time so many people came to

160
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,439

stash is happening in Denver Colorado

563
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,679
June 22nd that's right it's a much

564
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,159
different event than the dgc cup very

565
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,400
very different um this is a much shorter

566
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,200
event a much smaller event um you were

567
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,798
given a shopping window when you buy

568
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,519
your ticket you were given a 1H hour

569
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,319
time slot you were LED in the building

570
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:39,879
for that 1 hour you can visit all the

571
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,558
booths you'd like then you were politely

572
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,840
uh what is it called escorted out the

573
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:46,079
back door uh and then that is where you

574
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,240
are welcome to the party there's a bunch

575
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,558
of boots outside where you can get um I

576
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,599
hope that the cheesecake guys is out

577
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,678
there big shout out to Bubba cheesecakes

578
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,279
uh and various food trucks and vendors

579
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,840
outside but the inside seed breeder area

580
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,639
is a very quick uh very quick shopping

581
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,079
experience you get a 1hour window which

582
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,720
is enough time you guys but it speeds

583
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,678
you up it gets it going and it makes

584
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,400
things much easier for the vendors uh

585
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,200
then we can re meet capacity without

586
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,400
keeping that building too crowded a lot

587
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,038
of advantages to these sort of events in

588
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,519
my opinion it gives me a minute to rest

589
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,558
between phases also uh the first hour

590
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,038
goes through at like 11: or noon after

591
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:20,720
that hour I get a five or 10 minute

592
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,000
break to clean up the booth take a drink

593
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,400
take a dab take a piss if I need to uh

594
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,759
all of that stuff makes for a better

595
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:31,240
