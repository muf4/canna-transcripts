heart podcast thanks for hanging out

28
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,339
with me you know I like to start the

29
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,829
show off by talking about what I've been

30
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:07,718
smoking on all day today I'm taking dabs

31
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:10,209
of rocket fuel and Broza from our

32
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:12,759
friends at apothecary farms I'm cracking

33
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:14,530
open the jar now and you know I've never

34
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,909
I don't think I've ever smelled rocket

35
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,608
fuel I don't think I've stood next to

36
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,380
rocket fuel before but I imagine this

37
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:22,478
could be close to what rocket fuel would

38
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:24,699
smell like it it's gassy it is fuel II

39
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,978
it's ridiculous it almost makes my eyes

40
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,859
burn just a little bit in a good way and

41
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:31,688
when I smoke this stuff you guys it does

42
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:33,669
make my brain try to fly away so I think

43
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:35,949
rocket fuel is the perfect name for this

44
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,990
it tastes great the high is beautiful

45
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,439
and it was a perfect choice for some pre

46
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:43,209
podcast dads before we get into the main

47
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,158
topic of the podcast I want to talk

48
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:47,769
about stitcher I'm sure a lot of people

49
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,829
were able to listen to episode 321 maybe

50
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:53,228
some people haven't listened yet

51
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:56,858
stitcher was having an issue with people

52
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:59,590
being able to download episodes via an

53
00:01:56,858 --> 00:02:01,868
Android phone or device and using the

54
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,609
stitcher application there was a long

55
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:05,978
technical explanation given to me by

56
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:08,710
stitcher I realized how we could fix it

57
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:10,270
and I have made Corrections if you were

58
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,590
not able to listen to the show on

59
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,270
stitcher for quite a while again I

60
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,469
apologize I already said this in another

61
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,150
episode but I just want to make sure

62
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,789
that I apologize to everybody

63
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,010
was unable to hear the show I understand

64
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:22,419
you rely on me for your grow updates I

65
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,669
will I understand a lot of people sent

66
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,619
me emails I have met may have read your

67
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:29,559
email on an episode you could not even

68
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,840
listen to I've got every episode up on

69
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,969
YouTube now so if you missed anything on

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,799
stitcher you can either go to the

71
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:37,628
stitcher website and you can listen

72
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:39,849
there or you can go to youtube and you

73
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:41,259
can listen there and I apologize but

74
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:43,598
everything is backed up somewhere else

75
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:44,919
so if you missed it on the app you can

76
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,959
still listen through the stitcher

77
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:48,578
website just open a web browser go to

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,319
stitcher and you can listen to the show

79
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,120
there but you shouldn't have that

80
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,699
problem anymore because I have corrected

81
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,739
it now my problem is that people that

82
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:58,358
missed the show on stitcher may have

83
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,069
just abandoned me I can tell by my

84
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:01,780
stitcher numbers that my audience isn't

85
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:02,888
what it used to be on stitcher and I

86
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,229
couldn't figure out what was wrong

87
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:07,359
people were simply not able to download

88
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:09,068
the show so they could not listen now

89
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,629
maybe those people disappeared and they

90
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:12,638
won't come back because they don't think

91
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:15,370
the show is accessible what would really

92
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,139
help me out is if you guys my friends

93
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,688
and family if you could reach out and

94
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:22,180
maybe post a tweet or an Instagram or a

95
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:24,219
Facebook post saying hey Rasta Jeff is

96

104
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,900

NEADS alright guys let's do a podcast

129
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,680
all about harvesting your cannabis we've

130
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,569
done an episode about determining when

131
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,129
your plants are ripe we've done an

132
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:45,250
episode about flushing your plants

133
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:47,409
before harvest now it is harvest time in

134
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,569
the garden there are a couple of things

135
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,490
we need to think about before we go in

136
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,050
and cut down the plants first of all I

137
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,420
should mention if this is your first

138
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,400
time cutting down cannabis plants you

139
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,410
thought they smelled strongly when they

140
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,599
were growing as soon as you cut those

141
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,130
[ __ ] down it's gonna double and smell

142
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,990
I know that sounds like I may be making

143
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:08,649
it up it sounds like I'm joking

144
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:11,949
no it is going to stink it's going to be

145
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:14,859
ridiculous if I grow one plant in a

146
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:16,599
small house we'll say in the attic or

147
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,030
the basement and then I chopped that

148
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,879
plant down and hang it up in that attic

149
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:23,529
or basement the stink of that plant so

150
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,120
normally you can smell it to the living

151
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:27,369
room right to the to the living room of

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,800
the house as soon as you harvest you can

153
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,240
smell that [ __ ] to the driveway I don't

154
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,250
know the science behind that I don't

155
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,480
know if it's paranoia I don't know if

156
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,160
it's because we're moving in and out of

157
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,720
the grow room or I don't know exactly

158
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,390
what it is but as soon as you cut down

159
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,250
that crop it's gonna stink more than you

160
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:43,959
were expecting so try to be prepared for

161
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,050
that some things you can do to be

162
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:49,509
prepared are maybe getting some ona gels

163
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,000
if you know what ona gels are ona gels

164
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:54,310
are jars filled with this gelatinous

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,230
substance that just eats up odor it

166
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,780
doesn't put out an odor but it eats up

167
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,030
the odors in the room so you open the

168
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:02,799
jar I used to just set a jar of it

169
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:03,879
behind a house plant or behind a picture

170
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,410
you know you got a picture your daughter

171
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,939
up on the coffee table or up on the end

172
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,860
table you just stick one of these ona

173
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,420
jars opened right behind it and that

174
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,430
just starts sucking up all the odor out

175
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,960
of the room so put those by the doors in

176
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,939
the entryways of your house where people

177
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,339
may come in and that way they're you're

178
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:21,129
sucking up that odor and then also if

179
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:23,649
you can't do the ona gels maybe do

180
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:25,240
something stronger to cover the smell

181
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,009
it's gonna be hard like if you're you're

182
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,900
spraying lilac air freshener you're

183
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:30,219
gonna smell while a canned weed the ona

184
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,079
gels are gonna be your best bet

185
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,660
something to neutralize the owner odor

186
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,909
would be your best bet another good idea

187
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,220
if you can afford it would be a carbon

188
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:42,100
scrubber most of us have a carbon filter

189
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,480
that blows air out of the grow room keep

190
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,250
that running because that's gonna

191
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,550
filtering the air and make it smell good

192
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,709
but also get a carbon filter with a

193
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,480
blower on top of it and just plug it in

194
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:54,159
and let that air run through the carbon

195
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,569
filter and now you're just sucking stink

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,730
out of the air cleaning up that

197
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:59,589
environment so be prepared it's gonna

198
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,620
stink that is something we need to start

199
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:04,299
with it will be stinky now before we

200
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,610
even start chopping down there's a few

201
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,500
more things to talk about where are all

202
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,720
of these plants going to go once you cut

203
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,060
them down let's plan this before we even

204
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,040
get to harvest time are you going to use

205
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,870
those circular racks that they sell at

206
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,640
the grow store the multi-tiered circle

207
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,439
racks are you gonna be able to make a

208
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,110
line some more with string and hang them

209
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,610
that's what I prefer do you have a space

210
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,650
that you're going to be able to control

211
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,020
the temperature and the humidity and

212
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:30,789
hopefully keep the aroma under control

213
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:33,159
and hopefully keep light out and also

214
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,700
keep people away start thinking about

215
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,500
that around week six or seven guys let's

216
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:39,819
not wait until week nine to start

217
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,069
figuring out where these plants are

218
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,019
going start thinking about that early so

219
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,730
you need a place for them to hang that

220
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:47,919
you can control the temperature a place

221
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,840
you can control the humidity in a place

222
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,939
you can keep people out of there and

223
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,419
also you're gonna have to control that

224
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:57,279
aroma so have a place prepared and keep

225
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,730
in mind that if you're gonna dry your

226
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,889
buds

227
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,890
if these buds hang in your dingy funky

228
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,779
basement they're going to taste like

229
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,069
funky dingy basement you've tasted that

230
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:08,109
smell on buds before and you probably

231
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,699
didn't realize why does this taste like

232
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,949
the damn basement you know why because

233
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:14,469
it was dried and cured and hung for

234
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,629
seven days and somebody's funky damp

235
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,450
dirty [ __ ] basement that's exactly

236
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:21,159
why so have some air exchange have some

237
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,810
temperature control and have a good

238
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,040
environment you guys create a good

239
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,800
environment for your plants you've

240
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,170
gotten them this far let's not ruin them

241
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,699
if you're growing in a grow Hut and you

242
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,250
don't have another crop coming up right

243
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:35,139
behind it why not just use that grow Hut

244
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,029
as you're drying space that would not be

245
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,860
a bad idea you're controlling that

246
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:41,139
environment already anyway so that is

247
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,668
always an option create a good

248
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:44,500
environment you guys will talk more

249
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:45,970
about the space in a minute you can just

250
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,440
use the grow room if you need to if you

251
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,060
don't have another crop coming up just

252
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,650
use your flower room or remove the

253
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:52,119
plants in to flower use the bedroom

254
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,769
that's always an option but we'll get

255
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,240
back to that don't worry you guys let's

256
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:56,620
talk more about the things we need to

257
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,169
prepare for before

258
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,460
harvest time comes you're going to need

259
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:06,039
a few tools I highly recommend gloves

260
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,210
the black or the blue fin nitrile gloves

261
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,219
they don't have to be super thick you're

262
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,080
just trying to not get sticky you guys

263
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,850
when you're trimming weed and when

264
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,650
you're harvesting and handling this

265
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,509
amount of weed you're gonna get sticky

266
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,860
you might want to wear long sleeves you

267
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:19,330
might want to wear just a long sleeve

268
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,250
over shirt that you could take off when

269
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,980
you're done you're going to get sticky

270
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,950
you are going to stink some people have

271
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,420
an allergy to cannabis I've got a friend

272
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,160
if she rubs up against a blue dream

273
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:32,439
plant she's gonna break out into a giant

274
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,439
rash so maybe cover yourself up

275
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,370
certainly wear gloves also if your eye

276
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,110
itches

277
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:42,850
do never rub your eye with a trichome

278
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,139
Laden finger if your eye itches and

279
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,970
you're trimming we'd take off your

280
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:48,580
gloves and then it's your eye with a

281
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,110
clean hand or if you've been trimming

282
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,820
and not wearing gloves go wash your

283
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,009
hands before you hit your eye or scratch

284
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,430
your eye because if you get resin in

285
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:59,439
your eye it is one of the most painful

286
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:01,479
experiences you will ever endure it

287
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,730
hurts and it won't stop I don't know

288
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,649
what makes it stop it just burns and

289
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,209
burns and burns and it's sticky and when

290
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:10,299
you blink you expect it to feel better

291
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,869
but it's just stickier it's so [ __ ]

292
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:15,099
miserable

293
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:17,080
so gloves a long-sleeve shirt you're

294
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,019
also gonna need some scissors

295
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,490
I recommend quality scissors you can buy

296
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,769
some cheap shitty scissors but they're

297
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,089
gonna break I also recommend using a

298
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,069
different pair of scissors for cutting

299
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,839
down the plants then you use for

300
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,830
trimming the plants when you're trimming

301
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,510
you're getting in there and getting the

302
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,100
fine details when you're cutting them

303
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:35,200
down you're using brute force and

304
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,320
cutting down tough plants you may need

305
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,629
some some thicker pruners you may need

306
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,700
some choppers to cut down a big plant I

307
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:43,750
don't know how big your stalk is but you

308
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,129
want to be able to get in there and cut

309
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,139
it down easily without hurting your

310
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:49,708
wrist without breaking your scissors so

311
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:52,000
I like something that has got a metal

312
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,919
solid piece to it for cutting them down

313
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,440
not the plastic scissors for cutting

314
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,360
them down metal to solid pieces of metal

315
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,310
from the handle to the blade then also

316
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,200
for trimming that's when I like the

317
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,809
little Fiskars the diamond tips or

318
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,930
something similar to that so something

319
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:09,129
to cut down the plants with scissors

320
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,959
shears whatever you're going to use be

321
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,939
prepared

322
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,850
and if you're gonna have more than one

323
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,740
person doing the chopping down get more

324
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,149
than one [ __ ] pair of shears there's

325
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,919
nothing more frustrating than watching

326
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,179
people stand around and not able to do

327
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,469
work because you don't have enough

328
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:24,299
scissors or you don't have the right

329
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,100
tools if you're gonna have a group of

330
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:28,109
people doing it get a group of shears I

331
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,610
know most you guys probably have a small

332
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,289
garden it's probably one or two of you

333
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,990
and you don't need giant bolt cutter

334
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:35,159
style shears or giant Fisker shears or

335
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,259
anything but I've been in that situation

336
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,419
before where I'm watching five guys wait

337
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:41,429
for work because it's just me with a set

338
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,528
of shears chopping down every plant so

339
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:45,659
have enough shears have enough gloves

340
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:47,220
maybe get a few different sizes of

341
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:49,289
gloves if you're gonna go buy a box of

342
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,300
gloves buy two maybe three get small

343
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:52,980
medium and large --es or maybe small

344
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:54,059
large and extra-large depends on who's

345
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,139
coming over to help you out but if

346
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:56,699
you're gonna have people helping if

347
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,129
they're gonna be harvesting and trimming

348
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,379
with you maybe you want a few different

349
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:02,970
size gloves and here's something I

350
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,860
should mention if you have applied any

351
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,209
pesticides to your cannabis plants and

352
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,919
you're gonna cut them down and have

353
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,599
other people work with them maybe you

354
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,009
should politely let those people know

355
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,750
what pesticides were applied to your

356
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,338
plants so that they can wear long

357
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,720
sleeves they can wear a mask they can

358
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,150
dress appropriately based on their

359
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,040
decisions based on what pesticides you

360
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,079
have applied some things don't bother me

361
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,669
some things I would want to put on some

362
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,550
long sleeves for and not get that on my

363
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:27,958
arms just personal preferences safety

364
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:30,000
it's always polite anyway

365
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,159
so the next thing we should talk about

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,259
is how are we gonna hang these plants

367
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,389
because the next thing you gotta buy is

368
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:38,129
something to hang them on are you going

369
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,500
to use so the gross store sells this

370
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:42,240
really nice hanger it's about three feet

371
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,190
around and it hangs in the middle and

372
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,320
then it's got four or five shelves on it

373
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,910
that you can just fill with buds that's

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
acceptable if you want to cut your buds

375
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:51,958
into small pieces or your branches into

376
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,909
small pieces and hang it on there that's

377
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,429
just fine but that's not the way I would

378
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:58,110
prefer to do it I prefer to hang the

379
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:59,489
branches so that the buds aren't

380
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,470
touching anything so that they don't get

381
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,480
a flat spot so that there's not a spot

382
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,089
where air can't flow around it I just

383
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,620
prefer to hang them so in Colorado were

384
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,570
allowed to grow six plants let's say

385
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,310
we've got a six plant harvest I would

386
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,320
get six coat hangers or clothes hangers

387
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:15,179
and then I would get some fishing line

388
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,490
or some thick hemp twine and I would

389
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:19,349
anchor that to two opposite ends of the

390
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,450
room so I've just got a nice piece of

391
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,339
string hanging across the room now you

392
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,910
can hang the plants on that string if

393
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,920
you want to

394
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:28,079
but if you're using multiple strains

395
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,659
maybe you've got six different plants

396
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,129
maybe you've got giant plants that's

397
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,409
when you can cut the plant into smaller

398
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:36,059
pieces and put it on the coat hanger and

399
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:38,309
you can label the coat hanger this is

400
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:40,169
all sour tangi this one is all black

401
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:42,419
cherry now we don't have one long line

402
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:44,639
of buds that get confused also it makes

403
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:47,159
more space another thing you're gonna

404
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,629
need is some sort of labels you might

405
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,100
want to get just some white duct tape

406
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,750
you can always just peel off a piece of

407
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,370
duct tape right on that stick it

408
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,200
wherever you want it or you can get some

409
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,909
real labels or you can improvise however

410
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,740
you need to but you're going to want

411
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,120
labels if you've got more than one

412
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,919
strain there's nothing worse than

413
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,060
getting [ __ ] confused right at the end

414
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:08,129
that's really frustrating so you've got

415
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:10,949
some way to control the odor you've got

416
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:12,870
a place thought of and prepared where

417
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,900
you can control the temperature the

418
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,820
humidity the lights the air flow the

419
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,559
aroma and the security you've got that

420
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,390
all prepared and you've got the proper

421
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,189
tools you've got gloves you've got

422
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:25,409
something to cut it down with you've got

423
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,870
something to hang it on now let's talk

424
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:30,230
about the room just a little bit you're

425
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:33,690
going to need I would recommend a

426
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,610
humidifier and a dehumidifier and also

427
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,200
some sort of exhaust fan to get the

428
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,029
stale air out of the room if it's a

429
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,650
small space you probably just crack the

430
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:41,669
door open but if you've got a lot of

431
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,620
plants and then you're gonna need to

432
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:45,629
exchange some air gonna need to get that

433
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,429
humid air out of there or the plants

434
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:50,399
will never dry they'll just get stagnant

435
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:53,069
and funky also I may recommend a small

436
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,809
fan you don't want air blowing directly

437
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,430
on to the buds but you want to move that

438
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:58,439
air around you just don't want it

439
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,819
stagnant and funky in there you really

440
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,190
want to be able to control the climate

441
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,629
also you're gonna need something to tell

442
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,410
you what's going on in there a

443
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:10,200
thermometer a hygrometer perhaps a pol

444
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:12,389
grow unit you want something in there so

445
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,830
you know what the temperature is what

446
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:16,169
the humidity is so you can adjust

447
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,970
accordingly now it feels like we've

448
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:20,189
talked a lot about what to buy and how

449
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,870
to prepare so let's talk a little bit

450
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,430
about the settings in the room since

451
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,379
we're talking about all this equipment I

452
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:27,299
like to put a humidifier and a

453
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,269
dehumidifier in the room and I set them

454
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:32,969
both at 50% that way I know that that

455
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:35,429
room is staying right around 50% if you

456
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,590
can set them up to something like a PL

457
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:39,269
Gro unit or if you can set them up to

458
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:42,000
that'll trigger them to go off and on

459
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:44,819
based on certain parameters put them

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,519
both at 50% have the dehumidifier work

461
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,370
to 50% have that humidifier worked to

462
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,149
50% and keep that room at 50% humidity

463
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,860
as consistently as possible now it may

464
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:57,870
be a good idea to have some sort of

465
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,909
exhaust fan in the room nothing major

466
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,980
just maybe a little 4-inch exhauster if

467
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:03,809
you can do it if you can just suck the

468
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,039
air out of that room occasionally that

469
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:07,109
would help you out that would get that

470
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,759
old stagnant funky air out of there if

471
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,580
that is not an option

472
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,870
open the door put a fan by the door just

473
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,820
make sure that air exchanges

474
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,190
occasionally so you don't get old air in

475
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,680
there now inside this room where you've

476
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,410
got your dehumidifier your humidifier

477
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,979
and some air exhaust try to keep it

478
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:28,139
somewhere around 70 degrees in that room

479
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,850
65 to 75 degrees will be ideal any

480
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,500
hotter you're gonna speed up the drying

481
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,080
it's also gonna get funky it's gonna

482
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,730
increase humidity any cooler the room

483
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,910
will start getting too dry and your buds

484
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,170
will get crispy too quickly so you've

485
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,610
got your temperature you've got your

486
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:43,919
humidity under control you've got some

487
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,470
air exchange let's put a small fan in

488
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,659
the room perhaps on the floor just to

489
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,980
keep the air moving around or up high in

490
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:52,139
the room you don't want it right in the

491
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,120
middle blowing on the plants too much

492
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,919
that's gonna create a dry spot and just

493
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,870
dry out some of those buds too quickly

494
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,819
we just want to move the air around so

495
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,169
it doesn't get stale I usually get one

496
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,030
of those fans that would sit on your

497
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:04,470
computer desk just a desk fan it's a

498
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,389
little tiny like a twelve or fourteen

499
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,920
inch fan put that in the corner on the

500
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,500
floor if you've got a small room that is

501
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,940
plenty just move the air around alright

502
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,009
so that sounds like we've got a pretty

503
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,920
good idea of a dry and cure space

504
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:19,410
basically a small room or a bro tent

505
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,420
that you can control the environment in

506
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,880
and you can hang those plants in safely

507
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,009
securely and in the dark if you need to

508
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,020
use a small closet you can do that just

509
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:29,940
make sure that door gets opened and

510
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,099
those buds don't get stale in there

511
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,779
also like I mentioned earlier if you

512
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,339
don't have sufficient drying space go

513
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,410
ahead and use the flowering room that

514
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:38,789
you flowered the buds in or maybe move

515
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,890
your next round of plants from the

516
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:44,190
bedroom into that flower and use your

517
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,660
bedroom grow tents always make nice dry

518
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,000
and cure areas if you're growing in a

519
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,790
five by five tent you could easily dry

520
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,569
your whole harvest and maybe a three by

521
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:52,980
three tent

522
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:55,829
that wouldn't be a problem at all you

523
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,599
don't need that much room to dry your

524
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:59,069
harvest well hopefully you do [ __ ]

525
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,319
hopefully you need a ten-by-ten but

526
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:02,638
that's not gonna be logical all right

527
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,349
now we know what to buy we know what

528
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:06,119
supplies we're gonna need we've got a

529
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,009
safe space set up for our plants

530
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,500
hopefully you've been flushing your

531
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:12,179
plants for ten to fourteen days there's

532
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,740
one more thing we should do before we

533
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,778
get to chopping these plants while they

534
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,940
are still standing up we should go and

535
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:19,500
take off all of the big leaves any leaf

536
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,210
that you can break off with your hand

537
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,369
now just go ahead and take it off the

538
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:26,129
plants don't need leaves you're about to

539
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:27,869
harvest them you can do this seven five

540
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:29,189
three days before harvest you can do it

541
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:31,079
right up before the moment you harvest

542
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,419
just start taking off all those big

543
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,069
leaves those leaves are unnecessary I

544
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,480
like to just go in and throw them right

545
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:37,710
on the floor just start tearing leaves

546
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,849
off the room right on the floor and

547
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,100
sweep up when you're done cuz there's

548
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:42,990
gonna be a lot of them just tear off all

549
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,699
of the leaves you can get you don't need

550
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,399
those this is gonna save you time when

551
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,500
it comes harvest time we're gonna cut

552
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:51,658
these plants down and let them dry all

553
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,638
those long leaves are just gonna dry on

554
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:55,200
there and be in the way and smell funky

555
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:57,089
and there are sticky [ __ ] to work

556
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,860
through once they dry they're much

557
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:00,869
easier to get off now so to snap them

558
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,939
right off of there the leaf this [ __ ]

559
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:05,699
out of the entire room before you cut

560
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,919
down any of the plants once they are all

561
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,528
Preedy foliated that's what I call the

562
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,070
pre harvest defoliation then it is time

563
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:15,509
to start chopping down these plants now

564
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,519
I don't know how big your plants are but

565
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:18,000
this is basically how I chop down a

566
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,888
plant

567
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,538
I kneel down or if it's on a table

568
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:23,428
whatever I walk to it I usually kneel

569
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:25,109
down to one knee and I grab the plant

570
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,028
right above where I'm gonna cut so I've

571
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:29,069
got the stalk just a couple inches above

572
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:30,509
the dirt I get my loppers or whatever

573
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:32,339
you want to call them your pruners your

574
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:34,620
shears and get in there and cut right

575
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:36,329
above the dirt right below my hand chop

576
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,729
and now it's gonna fall over it's gonna

577
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:40,378
timber on me if I got a little plant no

578
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,028
problem if I'm in a three or five gallon

579
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,778
pot I got this by myself if I've got a

580
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,849
bigger plant

581
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:46,230
I will ask somebody to help me Hey Dude

582
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,788
hold the top of this because when I cut

583
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,089
it it's gonna [ __ ] timber down on us

584
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:53,849
so I would get in there and cut it right

585
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:55,709
at the base if you've got maybe a tomato

586
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,329
cage or some trellising or something

587
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,798
like that

588
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:00,418
maybe figure out how to get the plant

589
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,429
out of there by cutting from the top

590
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:04,200
down I like to cut the whole plan out in

591
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:05,519
one piece and hang the whole thing

592
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,160
upside down and let

593
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,529
all dry in one piece that's the way I

594
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,230
like to do it if you put the plant in a

595
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:15,149
screen of green or a tomato cage you may

596
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,759
have to start at the top and cut out

597
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:20,430
individual branches that is just fine

598
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,769
make sure you get you keep each branch

599
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,330
of each strain together so that you

600
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,920
don't mix anything up I mentioned

601
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,949
earlier how frustrating that [ __ ] is

602
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,480
don't make stuff up so separate your

603
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,490
plant free your plant from its tomato

604
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,710
cage free the plant from the trellis

605
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,660
however you need to then chop it down

606
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,759
now if you've got the whole plant

607
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,890
chopped down in one piece just get a I

608
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,390
get it a fuzzy stick is what they're

609
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,150
called they saw them at Hobby Lobby or

610
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,590
you can use the twisty ties become with

611
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,060
your trash bags cuz I never use the

612
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:49,949
twisty ties in the trash bags anyway

613
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,929
they always end up for this purpose wrap

614
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,700
the twisty tie around the base of the

615
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,529
plant do it kind of do it securely put

616
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,180
another put a branch in there because it

617
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:59,519
may slide off and then tie that to

618
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,320
either your coat hanger or the line that

619
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,359
you're gonna hang it from if you've got

620
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:05,189
the line hanging across the room attach

621
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,109
it to that securely hang it on there in

622
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,029
a way that you know it's not gonna fall

623
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:12,359
if you've got to cut it down into

624
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:14,519
branches try to cut to where you create

625
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:16,319
little v-shape intersections and if you

626
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:18,119
hang the plant upside down you'll see

627
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,309
the little wishbone shaped intersections

628
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,349
that you can use perfectly to hang your

629
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:25,079
branches on your coat hanger or on your

630
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:27,359
line so cut the plant flip it upside

631
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,279
down and just hang it in the size of

632
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,109
sections that you need to here's some

633
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,759
advice if you have to cut your plant

634
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:36,569
down into smaller sections to make it

635
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:39,029
fit make the sections similar sizes that

636
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:40,859
way they dry at similar speeds if you've

637
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,509
got one big piece and one little piece

638
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,709
that big piece is gonna take longer to

639
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,210
dry them the little piece it's gonna

640
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,130
cause unevenness and you're gonna be

641
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,840
confused on what to do so chop

642
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,220
everything if you're gonna chop it let

643
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,009
it all hang in one big piece if you're

644
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,360
gonna let it hang in one big piece so

645
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:56,369
cut the plant at the base or pull out

646
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,199
the branches hang them on the coat

647
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:00,149
hanger either by using the twisty ties

648
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,069
and securing it to the coat hanger there

649
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,110
or just by using the v-shaped

650
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:05,939
intersections and hanging it like a

651
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:08,039
little hook on the v-shaped intersection

652
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,200
and just get everything hanging safely

653
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,359
in your drying cure room chop everything

654
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,420
down and just go hang it all up you're

655
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:16,129
gonna be super excited now

656
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,690
you're gonna want to go post all your

657
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,090
social media about how you just took

658
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,009
down your first harvest but do not do

659
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:24,379
that here is some old-school advice

660
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:27,650
don't post any pictures or talk about

661
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,840
your harvest until it's gone if it's

662
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,180
going out for retail if it's going into

663
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,220
your jar and you're safe that's when you

664
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,140
talk about it don't talk about it while

665
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,579
that [ __ ] is hanging in a room don't

666
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,550
talk about it while you're trimming it

667
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:43,519
don't talk about it yet just wait okay

668
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:46,730
just wait because right now it's hanging

669
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,440
in a room and when you go to Walmart and

670
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,180
you post a back to facebook also

671
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,380
someone's going on your back [ __ ]

672
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,940
door and getting all your weed and

673
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,160
they're gonna trim it for you and you're

674
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,309
never gonna see any of it so don't post

675
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,220
yet hold off just wait now if you're

676
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:03,079
chopping down multiple strains carefully

677
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,240
carefully carefully label these plants

678
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:06,349
you're gonna so I'll go back I'll recap

679
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,450
a little bit cuz I feel like I went fast

680
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:10,609
grab it right above the dirt chop it

681
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,920
down it's gonna flip upside down and

682
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:14,329
hold it upside down either put one

683
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,620
branch over your line that you're gonna

684
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:18,500
hang it on and let it hang right there

685
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:20,239
put a label on it or put it on a coat

686
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,589
hanger just slide the one branch through

687
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,029
the coat hangers where it's got one arm

688
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:24,319
through and then it's just hanging put

689
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:26,690
it on the co hanger or cut it into

690
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,869
smaller pieces and do it that way label

691
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,400
the coat hanger what strain you've got

692
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:34,519
so cut it down hang it up

693
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,370
label it it's gonna hang there for

694
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,900
somewhere between 5 and 14 maybe a

695
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,319
couple more days I haven't seen them

696
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,870
gone

697
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,859
go more than 14 days in Colorado but if

698
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:45,259
you're on the coast or you've got

699
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:46,759
humidity you may get some more time so

700
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:48,500
you've chopped him down they're hanging

701
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,629
upside down you've got them labeled

702
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,519
you've got the lights temperature

703
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,230
humidity and air flow all controlled in

704
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:57,139
your room now you're just gonna have to

705
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,569
wait somewhere between 5 and 14 days for

706
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,440
those sticks to start snapping when you

707
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:05,089
bend them you just want him to go crunch

708
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,559
you don't want him to explode you don't

709
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:08,689
want him to just crumble up like an old

710
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,129
bag of Doritos you just want him to snap

711
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,960
you don't want a bunch of moisture in

712
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,390
there and check a few of them before you

713
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,539
get excited but when they start snapping

714
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,640
consistently that is when the dry phases

715
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:23,299
ended and it is time to work yourself

716
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,650
into the cure phase all right no I did

717
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,329
skip the part about putting them onto

718
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,519
dry racks that I talked about you could

719
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:29,289
get from the gross store

720
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,210
the gross store sells these dry racks

721
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:32,769
they look like a 22 inch kick drum head

722
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,410
I think they're about 24 inches around

723
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:37,269
um they're messy and they're kind of

724
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,269
cheap but they work really well you just

725
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:42,670
hang it up and for this I would probably

726
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:46,450
take the buds off of the sticks and just

727
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:48,039
put just the buds into those racks

728
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,779
I wouldn't put the sticks in there I

729
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:51,339
feel like the sticks are gonna take up a

730
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,928
lot of space in there and they also get

731
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:54,730
stuck in the [ __ ] netting a whole lot

732
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:57,190
and they're a pain in the ass I would

733
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,200
cut every single bud off of the stick if

734
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,730
it were me and I would lay the buds in

735
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,590
there and I would spread them out kind

736
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,970
of far and then every morning when I

737
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:05,619
wake up I would go in there and just

738
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,360
move those buds around and kind of

739
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:09,250
shuffle them around a little bit that's

740
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,839
not the ideal way to do it but I

741
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,759
understand that some of us are limited

742
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:15,250
on space if that's what you've got to do

743
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:17,019
that's what you have got to do I would

744
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,970
rather see you hang them until they dry

745
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:21,009
and get a little drier and as soon as

746
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,308
the stick snaps then get it off the

747
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:26,170
stick but I understand that sometimes

748
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:27,879
you've got to improvise that's part of

749
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,130
being a good grower being able to adjust

750
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,300
adapt and improvise with what you've got

751
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,760
when you've got it

752
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:35,649
people are so [ __ ] spoiled now we've

753
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,650
got these giant facilities with parking

754
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:41,350
lots and security cameras and loading

755
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,730
bays and Friends when I first started

756
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:44,079
doing this you couldn't talk about it

757
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,490
you couldn't have your friends help you

758
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,049
carry your groceries into the house

759
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,549
because now they know you're growing and

760
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:50,589
they're gonna want something or they're

761
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,329
gonna [ __ ] steal it if you need more

762
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:53,649
space you just call a contractor and you

763
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:55,089
get a building permit and you just build

764
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,710
out another room and you've got a dry

765
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:58,449
and cure area back in the day we

766
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,558
couldn't do that you would catch people

767
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,240
drying their [ __ ] weed in the

768
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,619
bathroom hey man I got a piss well at

769
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,269
your house no bro you can't pee here

770
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:06,099
what man I just gotta pee no bro you

771
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:07,389
can't pee and then you catch on later

772
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:09,339
that he was drying and curing his

773
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,410
[ __ ] weed in the bathroom anyway I

774
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:12,609
got rambley there those dry racks are

775
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,710
cool if that's what you got to do of

776
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:16,629
course I would prefer to hang it I'd

777
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,850
prefer to hang it whole plant I'd prefer

778
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,950
to hang it till it starts snapping like

779
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:23,199
I said that's when we enter the Cure

780
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,970
phase now if you didn't have time or the

781
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,009
forethought to start defoliating your

782
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,299
plants before you harvested don't be

783
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:30,069
afraid to go in there and take off all

784
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:31,899
the excess leaves while they're hanging

785
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:33,819
upside down it is never too late to do

786
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,220
that all right you guys I feel like I

787
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:36,700
can reek rat reek rap let's recap what I

788
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,470
said

789
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,390
probably a recap would be better for a

790
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,788
podcast let's recap a little bit you

791
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,229
need the appropriate tools you need

792
00:26:41,788 --> 00:26:45,358
appropriate equipment you need a good

793
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:47,100
room you need to be able to control the

794
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:48,449
temperature and humidity you don't want

795
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:50,728
people getting in there you need to

796
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,019
control the aroma you're gonna need some

797
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:53,909
gloves you're gonna need something to

798
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:55,979
hang your plants on and you're going to

799
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:58,859
need some sort of labels if you're

800
00:26:55,979 --> 00:27:01,080
growing more than one strain it's a good

801
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:02,368
idea to start pre D Foley 18 if you can

802
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,710
get in there and take off the leaves

803
00:27:02,368 --> 00:27:06,749
before the chop down process is fairly

804
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,069
simple grab it chop it hanging that

805
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:10,259
[ __ ] upside down and let it

806
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:11,819
start drying we know what temperature

807
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:14,940
and humidity we need to keep the dry and

808
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:17,189
cure room we want about 50% about 70

809
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,690
degrees let those plants hang for four

810
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,538
or five days and start snapping the

811
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,548
stems and see if they pop it'll be 5 7

812
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:25,440
10 maybe 14 days before they're ready to

813
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:26,729
go into containers that's when we're

814
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,349
gonna jar him up that's where we're

815
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,389
gonna put them into containers that's

816
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:33,118
when the cure process is gonna start so

817
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:35,728
I think we've got a good grasp on how to

818
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:37,288
harvest our plants the next step in

819
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:39,989
harvesting you guys is to get in there

820
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:42,450
and clean and reset the grow room that's

821
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:43,558
right it may be time to buy new bulbs it

822
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,690
may be time to change your air

823
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,999
conditioner filters it is certainly time

824
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,399
to clean the cover on your carbon filter

825
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:53,038
also maybe get in there and scrub the

826
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,569
lenses if you've got glass lenses on

827
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,489
your ducted hoods it's a good time to

828
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:57,808
get in there and scrub that [ __ ] out

829
00:27:56,489 --> 00:28:00,149
make sure that everything is nice and

830
00:27:57,808 --> 00:28:02,009
clean clean the room with a cleaning

831
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:04,199
product maybe some bleach maybe some

832
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,999
flies and whatever you've got get in

833
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,729
there and clean the [ __ ] out of the grow

834
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:10,710
room but get in the corners get in all

835
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,269
the spots you've been missing if you

836
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,669
plan on using your grow room or your

837
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:16,048
grow Hut as you're drying space that's a

838
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:17,460
good excuse but you're gonna have to

839
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:19,229
clean it as soon as you're done with

840
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,548
that as soon as those plants come out of

841
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:22,470
there and you're trimming you should

842
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:24,479
take a break and go clean the [ __ ] out

843
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,639
of your grow space before you put more

844
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:29,399
plants in there that is the completion

845
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:31,709
of your harvest that is also the

846
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:32,998
completion of your harvest lesson ladies

847
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,999
and gentlemen thanks for hanging out

848
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:37,919

849
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:39,839
a guest scheduled so there will be

850
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,239

851
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,848
episode but there is an in-depth dry and

852
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:46,619
cure episode coming up I will also talk

853
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,058
about trimming a little bit and then I

854
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:50,038

855

and cutting clones and getting a grouse

858

up this podcast I am not sure if I will

00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:56,070
do a Thursday episode this week I've got

917
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:58,710
plans to record an episode in Denver on

918
00:30:56,069 --> 00:31:01,079
Wednesday I probably won't be able to

919
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,730
get that prepared until Monday so that

920
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:06,000
disrupts my recording schedule a little

921
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,798
bit but I do apologize I told you I may

922
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,429
miss a Thursday occasionally this will

923
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:10,798
be the

924
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:13,080
first Thursday that I've missed since I

925
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,210
started Thursday episodes I apologize if

926
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,859
it happens you guys know me I'm probably

927
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,480
gonna put together something just to

928
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:20,548
have it prepared just in case

929
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,470
so look forward to an episode Thursday

930

to Denver to record Wednesday and I got

933
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,398
overwhelmed the episode will probably

934
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:30,749
come out Monday and everything will be

935
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:32,459
