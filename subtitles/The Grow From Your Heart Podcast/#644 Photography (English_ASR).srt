84
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,519

93
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,319

uh commercial recreational and medical

95
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,199
dispensaries throughout colorado that do

96
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,919
have

97
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,359
my clones my plants in their grows but i

98
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,719
can't promise you when it will be on the

99
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,720
shelf they've got to grow it

100
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,479
they've got to harvest it dry it cure it

101
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,840
manifest it transfer it over the store

102
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,119
it's got to be on the shelf it's got to

103
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,439
be there when you get there

104
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,239
i really have no way of knowing what

105
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,840
happened that's just

106
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
it's their product once they've got the

107
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,640
seeds it is theirs once you guys have

108
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,239
purchased the seeds

109
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,759
uh you can ask me questions about how to

110
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,400
grow it and whatnot but those are your

111
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,079
seeds

112
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,400
you can do whatever you want with them

113
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,319
and yes you do have my blessing to breed

114
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
with the seeds that you get from me

115
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,759
please do breed with them

116
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,359
in exchange give me credit when you list

117
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,798
the genetics on your pack at least put

118
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,480
the proper strain name

119
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
and then maybe send me a 10 pack of

120
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,119
something if you bread something cool

121
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,120
but i'm not sure where to get flowers or

122
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,719
clones of my genetics and dispensaries

123
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,959
in colorado

124
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,560
also you cannot get my seeds in anywhere

125
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,479
in colorado just because of the way that

126
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,239
colorado law is set up

127
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,399
there are some boundaries there i do

128
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,280
recommend the online vendors for seeds

129
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560
check out my website iriegenetics.com

130
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,400
uh that will give you a link to

131
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,680
approximately seven vendors on there we

132
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,360
will be adding more

133
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,719
uh shortly i'm just updating checking

134
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,319
emails getting all that stuff caught up

135
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,919
seeing what i can handle honestly

136
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,158
i don't wanna promise too many vendors

137
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,238
things that i cannot send to them so the

138
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,318
seeds are available on the internet

139
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,480
you've got to go to ireadgenetics.com

140
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,878
maybe seeds herenow.com

141
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,798
maybe dankseed.store there are a lot of

142
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:11,679
different options my website has a big

143
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,120
list

144
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,719
they will all have different stuff in

145
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
stock they'll be doing different deals

146
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,079
different pricing that is all up to them

147
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
they run their business how they would

148
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,439
like but their websites are all linked

149
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,959
up to my website

150
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,680
so the seeds you can get them on the

151
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,120
website clones and flowers i do not know

152
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,800
where to tell you to get clones or

153
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,560
flowers or finish product

154
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
i will not ship you anything i will not

155
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,280
mail you anything i will not meet you

156
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
anywhere for anything

157
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,959
you've got to use the apps that are

158
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,400
available to shop the dispensaries there

159
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,079
are a couple apps you can use

160
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,000
i'm not sure what you like the best use

161
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,918
the one you're using type in a strain

162
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
name look for a dispensary where you are

163
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,439
or where you're going or in that area

164
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,079
and see if it is available

165
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,079
i know that randomly i don't endorse any

166
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,560
specific dispensary i just happen to

167
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,879
know

168
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,079
that occasionally randomly a place

169
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,079
called trench town

170
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,839
has a couple of irie genetic strains

171
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,359
call before you drive

172
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,560
uh they may not even tell you anything

173
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
on the phone you may have to check out

174
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
the website or something

175
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,359
they don't know that you're 21 so when

176
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
you call the dispensary and you say

177
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,479
do you have this product and they say we

178
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,319
can't tell you over the phone that's

179
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,599
because you've got to be 21 to shop in

180
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,199
the dispensary and they don't want to

181
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,879
tell you anything if you're not 21

182
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,160
they're trying to protect themselves

183
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,759
so don't think they're being a dick

184
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,199
don't think they're being mean to you uh

185
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,720
we're trying to keep our licenses it

186
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,000
costs a million bucks for that license

187
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,440
we're not going to give it away

188
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
by giving dumb information over the

189
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,478
phone so don't feel like they're uh

190
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,680
being disrespectful they're trying to

191
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,918
cover their own ass you may have to

192
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,478

have a purpose if they're starting out

334
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,639
looking for color that's a great goal a

335
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,079
great purpose

336
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,240
great bag appeal that will make you

337
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,759
stand out uh if you set three bags of

338
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,360
herb on the table and yours is [ __ ]

339
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,639
bright red or bright purple someone's

340
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,519
gonna grab that they're gonna want to

341
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,000
buy that [ __ ]

342
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,959
it gets attention so you're hitting the

343
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,639
bag of peel

344
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,239
on nailing that one right on the or

345
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,958
hitting that nail on the head

346
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
then it says these are almost five weeks

347
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,759
old

348
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,519
and as i popped into the tent to make an

349
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,519
update for youtube i see that two of

350
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,720
these babies are pre-flowering

351
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,399
and i mean they're just hitting

352
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,278
pre-flowers the pistols are barely

353
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,839
poking out

354
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,000
and the color is wild and it's got

355
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,720
exclamation points why the word color is

356
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
wild

357
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,879
now here's the question it says my

358
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,759
question is do you know what causes this

359
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,519
or the reason

360
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,759
that plants make colors and how it

361
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,399
spreads into the veins of the leaves

362
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,078
i've had many purplish strains but uh

363
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,720
this one looks like it is bleeding into

364
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:28,719
the leaves

365
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
fast is it a chlorophyll type of

366
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,440
chemical

367
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,120
and then it says it could be genetic and

368
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,040
then he lists his environment which

369
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,159
uh we don't need to go too much further

370
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,958
because you've already

371
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,159
answered the question yourself it is uh

372
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,078
basically

373
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,559
uh similar to chlorophyll but this is

374
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,679
known as an anthocyan i had to print

375
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,319
that word out because i've been saying

376
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,838
it wrong

377
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,360
i've just been calling it anthos because

378
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,079
i wasn't sure how to say the last part

379
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,919
because

380
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,199
i've never had to say it out loud before

381
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,679
honestly until today but

382
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,680
what you're seeing is anthocyanin it is

383
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,958
basically the purple version of

384
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,319
chlorophyll it's the

385
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,559
chlorophyll is what makes the leaves

386
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,120
green anthocyanin is what is making

387
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,599
that purple reddish color a lot of other

388
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
uh

389
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
things have that pigment is what we're

390
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,720
gonna call it uh carrots were actually

391
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,639
purple when they first started that's

392
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,160
what gives beets that color i think

393
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,319
from what i've read uh they've got

394
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,919
anthocyanin

395
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,760
uh it's blue violet or a red flavonoid

396
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,039
pigment found in plants this is the

397
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,759
definition of that so that's what you're

398
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,799
seeing

399
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,799
um and it's easy not easy it's

400
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,159
uh i guess it's easy to breed for that

401
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,759
because it's visually

402
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,199
uh identifiable when you're breeding

403
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,000
when you're growing plants that is a

404
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,160
very easy

405
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,240
visual indicator to identify like

406
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,639
potency pest resistance

407
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,440
uh hermaphroditism those are all traits

408
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,559
you've gotta wait and find out for

409
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,640
hermaphroditism you will see that

410
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,239
but you gotta wait that orange purple

411
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,919
different colors that's a very

412
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,519
visual thing you can definitely breed

413
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,719
for that you can select for that find

414
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,399
those very early

415
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,240
know if you're hitting your goal find

416
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,320
breeding plants that is very cool so

417
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
that's a really cool goal um he's

418
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,800
hitting the goal if you're getting

419
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,959
plants with that many colors

420
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,000
so that is a successful breeding project

421
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,359
in my opinion

422
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,600
all right newbie nugs what you've got

423
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,039
going on there is anthocyanin

424
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,720
uh they're hitting their goal they bred

425
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,439
for that red and purple color it's

426
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,600
popping up

427
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,040
that is exactly what you're seeing uh

428
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
thank you for the great question bro

429
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,559
thank you for the patreon support if

430
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,320
you've got any more questions i do look

431
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,000
forward to hearing from you

432
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,920
all right this one actually came from

433
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
youtube i don't generally answer

434
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,319
questions from the youtube comments

435
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,078
i happen to notice this one uh it's not

436
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
that i'm ignoring the youtube comments

437
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:35,278
there are just a lot of them

438
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,799
and as a content uh creator

439
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,120
we are taught not to read a lot of the

440
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,278
comments because uh the comments are

441
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,959
[ __ ] where all the savagery happens

442
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,559
the comments are where the savagery

443
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,599
happens that sentence wasn't as hard to

444
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,599
say as it looked

445
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
um people aren't kind in the comments

446
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,959
people don't give a [ __ ] in the comments

447
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,160
so we don't read a lot of them because

448
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,000
we just don't want to

449
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,519
just why even delve into the negativity

450
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,839
but i saw this one pop up

451
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,600
i actually got the email and it says

452
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,279
just like this it's from our friend

453
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,000
big mike from canada and it says great

454
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,879
show as usual and it says question

455
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,799
what are your smoke test processes once

456
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,039
you have created a new strain

457
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,799
how long into curing it do you wait uh

458
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,879
do you have smoke testers

459
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,639
do you test the flowers only or to the

460
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,559
concentrates also

461
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,159
do you wait for lab results i would

462
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,159
appreciate it if you could elaborate

463
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,319
during a show for these important steps

464
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,120
to choose for your keepers many thanks

465
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,959
in advance

466
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,879
keep up the great work you can mention

467
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,119
my name i'm big mike from

468
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,240
canada big mike from canada these are

469
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,240
great questions

470
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,320
uh let's just get right to it what are

471
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,079
your smoke test processes once you've

472
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,839
created a new strain

473
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,159
uh basically chop it down dry it and

474
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,040
cure it and smoke it my favorite ways

475
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,559
i roll a fat joint of it pack a bowl of

476
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,599
it pack a bong load of it

477
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:52,719
then i'm gonna smoke it um how long

478
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,199
into curing do you wait uh generally

479
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,120
i dry it i cure it for maybe a week

480
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,198
maybe two i am not one of those guys

481
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,198
that does the ridiculously long cure i

482
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,759
don't find it necessary to go a long

483
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:03,439
time

484
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,600
the chemical process i'm looking for

485
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,920
happened in about two weeks that's all i

486
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,519
need out of that then i start smoking it

487
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,439
sometimes i don't wait that long um

488
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,679
do you have smoke testers yeah everybody

489
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
around here loves to be a smoke tester

490
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,519
all i have to do is say hey i got some

491
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,838
new herb

492
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,039
and the couches will be full uh people

493
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,959
will invite me over

494
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,958
i get really popular when they know that

495
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,879
it is almost time to do some testing

496
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,399
uh some phenotype selections yeah i've

497
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,679
got a crew um

498
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,519
shout out to the crew they know who they

499
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,638
are uh by the way doug i miss you bro we

500
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
need to get you back on the smoke

501
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,519
testing team

502
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,560
if you still watch the show gotta get

503
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,879
you smoking again

504
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,078
um smoke testers yeah shout out to all

505
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,078
the test crew they know who they are

506
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,638
mike is one of the number one testers

507
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,078
um it's always up to me though i am i'm

508
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,759
the [ __ ] head [ __ ] in charge

509
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,039
if i decide that number six is the best

510
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,480
and other people said that number three

511
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,198
was the best guess what number six is

512
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,120
the winner

513
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,039
because i'm the one that [ __ ] i've

514
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,240
got the goal i know the plan so

515
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,759
i also know that that plant's going to

516
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,278
get bred to in the future and i've got

517
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,679
other ulterior motives

518
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,639
anyway uh test crew yes there's a test

519
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,799
crew

520
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,278
um what's the next part do you test the

521
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,159
flowers only or the concentrates

522
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,120
it depends on uh the timing if there's

523
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,719
somebody around that can make

524
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,159
concentrates for me sometimes getting

525
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,680
somebody to make some diamonds for me to

526
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,000
make some sauce or batter

527
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,120
is time consuming and it does uh they do

528
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,879
charge me for that

529
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,399
sometimes it's not cost effective

530
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,278
sometimes there's not enough product to

531
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,639
make it worth it

532
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,078
sometimes i just grew a bunch of tiny

533
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
tiny plants and we're just going to

534
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,039
smoke the flowers and see because that's

535
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,278
really what matters if the

536
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,039
flowers are no good most of the

537
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,360
customers are going to smoke it

538
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,278
as a flower when they buy seeds from me

539
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,278
most of them are only going to smoke

540
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,958
as a flower only a small percentage of

541
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,679
them will continue to make concentrates

542
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,838
out of it

543
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,439
um i know most of what i make is going

544
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,959
to make amazing concentrates

545
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
just because the potency and the terps

546
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,439
that i've chosen for my breeding palette

547
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,079
always

548
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,600
make great concentrates so if it's

549
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,039
available if it's an option i do have

550
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,639
concentrates made

551
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,639
do you wait for lab results that's a

552
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,240
good question a lot of people are hyped

553
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,480
up on lab results and i've started to

554
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,320
care less and less about lab results

555
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,519
um i've never had a high pressure liquid

556
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,079
chromatography machine

557
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,600
buy seeds from me i've never had a

558
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,519
[ __ ] lab device

559
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,680
smoke weed with me and say that it was

560
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,879
really good or really bad i don't smoke

561
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,719
weed with machines

562
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,000
i don't grow weed for test results i

563
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,399
grow weed for [ __ ]

564
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
human results human consumers that's who

565
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,559
is going to smoke it humans are going to

566
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,399
grow it

567
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,159
humans are going to smoke it i i

568
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,839
appreciate what the lab says

569
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,519
but i'd rather hear what you've got to

570
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,199
say i'd rather hear what mike's got to

571
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,839
say i'd rather hear what doug's got to

572
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:35,439
say

573
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,279
i'd rather hear what everybody in the

574
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,880
smoke circle's got to say about it

575
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,320
compared to what a [ __ ] machine has

576
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,000
to say about it the machines are awesome

577
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,879
the testing is cool

578
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
but what difference does it make if i

579
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,639
smoke it

580
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,079
mike smokes it kevin smokes it [ __ ]

581
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,480
matt smokes it

582
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,479
uh everybody smokes it and we all say

583
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,240
that sample number three is the winner

584
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,000
but the lab tests show that sample

585
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
number six has higher numbers

586
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,360
who cares what the lab test said we all

587
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,799
enjoyed number three better

588
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,120
we're the humans that are going to be

589
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,078
consuming it i've never smoked a joint

590
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,519
with a machine

591
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,438
pretty sure i have i'm pretty sure i

592
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,639
[ __ ] blew weed into a machine at the

593
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,000
bowling alley when it wouldn't [ __ ]

594
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,520
work right one time and it worked it

595
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,519
fixed that son of a [ __ ] but

596
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,199
anyway um i don't worry too much about

597
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,400
lab results in lab tests i do love

598
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,160
seeing a high number

599
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
it definitely it works for marketing i

600
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,839
think the numbers are more for marketing

601
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
we put the numbers on there people want

602
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:26,639
to buy the seeds when they see a higher

603
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,000
number at the dispensary

604
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,919
people just straight up say what's your

605
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,440
concentrate with the highest thc

606
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,440
so those numbers are good for marketing

607
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,240
good for advertising for me

608
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,679
it doesn't make a difference i want um i

609
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
want more terps if the number is

610
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,600
super high in thc then where do the

611
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,279
terps go we need just lower the thc and

612
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,480
put some terps in there for me and i'll

613
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,000
be okay

614
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,360
um there is more for this i would

615
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,519
appreciate it if you could elaborate on

616
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,798
this during a show i think i elaborated

617
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,319
bro on these important steps for

618
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,200
choosing keepers

619
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,798
um choosing keepers it's a lot of it is

620
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,679
the smoke report but a lot of it is how

621
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:59,359
does it grow

622
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,880
uh did it give me any problems any

623
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,479
stress during the grow

624
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,080
do i think that it's got traits that

625
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,839
it's going to pass on

626
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,599
in the offspring if i breed to it that

627
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,199
are going to give you problems as a

628
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,279
consumer i want to make sure that you've

629
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,160
got seeds that will be successful

630
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,879
a lot of my decision making in selection

631
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,240
is for

632
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,559
you um you may not be

633
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,880
the people purchasing the seeds may not

634
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,759
be as experienced of a grower as myself

635
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,520
you may not have

636
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,200
thousands of hours thousands of crops

637
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,558
under your belt you may not be a

638
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,880
commercial grower with

639
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,839
resources and space and [ __ ] money

640
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,919
for products

641
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,159
this may be the only pack of seeds you

642
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,919
can buy this may be the first pack of

643
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,440
seeds you bought this may be your first

644
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,559
and last run at growing wheat if you're

645
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,440
not successful

646
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,759
so i do my best to select plants that i

647
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,000
know

648
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,160
are going to make seeds that give you a

649
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,798
good opportunity to grow that's my main

650
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,200
goal

651
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,400
as a seed producer i do breed stuff that

652
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,000
you never get

653
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,640
ah because it's kind of bread for me

654
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,119
that's my secret stash i kind of know

655
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,679
that

656
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,479
if i put like uh some chem 91 and some

657
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
old og

658
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,839
kush [ __ ] together there's an

659
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,359
opportunity for intersex traits there

660
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,480
there's an opportunity for pain in the

661
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,798
ass plants

662
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,240
that stuff won't go anywhere that stays

663
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:10,639
for me but the stuff that i'm breeding

664
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,919
for

665
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,600
you that i know is going to be

666
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,038
commercially viable that i know i want

667
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,240
to release to the masses

668
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,240
i make sure that it's going to be

669
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,240
successful for the

670
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,839
very beginner grower and then i know

671
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,599
that the commercial grower the pro

672
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,879
grower that my crew my friends are going

673
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,439
to kill it they're going to hit the

674
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,200
numbers

675
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,640
they're going to hit bonuses everyone's

676
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,679
going to eat fat we're going to get good

677
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,360
concentrates

678
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,798
so that's what i put out as my

679
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,119
commercial seed

680
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,639
line i know you're going to have success

681
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,959
um so that's a part of

682
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,559
my selection for keepers then does it

683
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,480
work well in my grow because i'm the one

684
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,678
growing it i got to keep it in my grow

685
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,200
does it show me any problems um

686
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,960
does it breed well with other things

687
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,519
it's got to be able to breed well with

688
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,079
multiple different crosses maybe can i

689
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,480
reverse

690
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,399
it that also helps me select a keeper as

691
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,160
a breeder i think my criteria for

692
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,919
selecting keepers may be a little bit

693
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,440
different than some people

694
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,960
a lot of people are just looking for

695
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
smoke a lot of people are looking for

696
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,159
something that smokes well

697
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,639
smells good looks good in the bag and

698
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,720
bottom line is does it pay the bills

699
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,240
so that's we're growing for different

700
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,079
things our bottom line is a different

701
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,200
thing so my selection may be a little

702
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,519
bit different

703
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,240
but as the breeder creating a product

704
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,519
for you i understand your main goal so

705
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,440
i think that helps a lot me

706
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,279
understanding your goal providing a

707
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,000
product for you to hit your goal

708
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,678
helps out a lot so um giant mike that

709
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,480
was a big mike that was a great question

710
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,400
bro thank you

711
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,079
thanks for listening up there in canada

712
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,759
i do appreciate that i'm making sure i

713
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,639
answered all of your questions here hit

714
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,119
all the points

715
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,799
the process bro roll it up and smoke it

716
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,158
uh roll a fat joint because i want to

717
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,599
taste the flavor i want to taste the

718
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,840
flavor down at the end

719
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,879
smoke it in a bowl because generally if

720
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,959
i'm smoking

721
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,320
weed around the house it's in a bowl

722
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,440
because i like to pack a bowl and i just

723
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,038
set it in my lap and

724
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,360
i [ __ ] hit it now and put it in my

725
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,558
lap and walk around with it and

726
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,918
if i don't have nothing to do for a

727
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:58,399
couple of seconds let's hit a bowl and

728
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,240
then just

729
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,159
carry it around so i like to have weed

730
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,679
and a pipe like that

731
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,039
if i don't have a lot of time i'm

732
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,320
getting kind of older now i hate to

733
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:07,599
admit it but hitting a bong kind of

734
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,319
hurts sometimes but

735
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,000
i like to take a big fat bong rip get a

736
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,558
lot of flavor get a lot of experience

737
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
from

738
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,319
that flower in a big fat bong rip and

739
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,960
then of course make some concentrates

740
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,279
out of it

741
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,360
um how long do i cure it my products

742
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,798
doesn't my products don't get cured for

743
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,240
very long my personal stuff i don't

744
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,918
believe in over curing i don't think

745
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,159
it's necessary

746
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,400
the testers are the crew i feel like i

747

812
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,678
message um i'm going to talk briefly

813
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,599
about cannabis photography before i do

814
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,120
that i have got to tell you honestly

815
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,079
straight up 100

816
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,798
i do not consider myself a photographer

817
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,079
i have got

818
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:34,400
absolutely zero photography training

819
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,000
i don't know what the numbers mean i

820
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,559
don't know what that stuff

821
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,919
means on the camera basically the way

822
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,000
i've learned it

823
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,278
i got a camera started turning the knobs

824
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
turn one knob this way

825
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:45,759
take a bunch of pictures and start

826
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,200
turning the knob the other way and as it

827
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,640
goes this way i paid attention to the

828
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,919
changes in my photos

829
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,600
then i picked a different setting and

830
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,360
set it all the way at one end started

831
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,879
taking pictures take a couple and switch

832
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,319
the settings this way as i go and pay

833
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,080
attention to the differences

834
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,359
then learn how those two settings kind

835
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,038
of work with each other

836
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,959
that's how i learned photography i know

837
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,200
that's not the way to do it

838
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,000
but that is kind of how i learned stuff

839
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,519
i've been learning

840
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,720
under the gun i got a camera and i

841
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,000
thought i want to take pictures and i

842
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,079
started shooting pictures

843
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
they went online immediately my photos

844
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,839
got better i just kept doing it as i was

845
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,319
learning i never stopped to like

846
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,000
take a class or learn anything then i

847
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,839
ended up doing a podcast ended up doing

848
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
a video podcast i'm learning the video

849
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,158
production the same exact way

850
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,919
i produce the shows i edit them and then

851
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,679
as i'm producing and editing them

852
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,600
i learn mistakes i made corrections i

853
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,360
can make improvements i can make as i go

854
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,959
that is how i learned photography video

855
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,038
production podcasting

856
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,480
so i learned cannabis growing i did a

857
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:39,440
lot of reading and research on cannabis

858
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,120
growing so i was

859
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,960
ah completely passionate about it but

860
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,879
photography just came

861
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,000
kind of naturally to me i don't know

862
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,679
what i'm doing

863
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,519
i don't know how to take pictures of

864
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,960
anything but cannabis plants and

865
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,918
sneakers that is what i can take

866
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,360
pictures of

867
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,559
uh if you sign me up to be the

868
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,158
photographer at your wedding or at a

869
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,240
birthday party you're gonna be [ __ ]

870
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,000
mad cause i don't know what i'm doing

871
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,079
like i honestly i just have a good eye

872
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,079
for the shot i know what i want

873
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,678
i've looked at magazines long enough to

874
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,519
see what works well

875
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,519
uh but honestly i don't know what i'm

876
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,960
doing technically there's no schooling

877
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,960
behind it it's all just

878
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,079
hey that's a good image let's catch that

879
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
so that is my disclaimer

880
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,240
i am not a photographer i play with a

881
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,119
camera so one of the first things you

882
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,480
said

883
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,158
um let's see one of the first things you

884
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,519
want to know about some simple tips with

885
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,320
gear to get started

886
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,720
honest bro most of my photos are done

887
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,759
with an

888
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,159
iphone 8 plus that is honest i've got

889
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,480
this

890
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,480
eight plus and i love it for photography

891
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,599
it works very it's simple

892
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,720
uh i also have a canon

893
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,079
um oh it's a nikon d3200 sorry my brain

894
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,798
farted right there i have a nikon

895
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:47,038
d3200 that is kind of an older camera

896
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,200
i've got two lenses for it one is

897
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,200
close up and one is further away i use

898
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,278
the further away lens and zoom in

899
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,360
really close and i get beautiful shots

900
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,278
it's a nikon d3200

901
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,519
not a super expensive camera kind of an

902
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,278
older camera that's what i learned with

903
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,798
that is how i learned how to take photos

904
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,720
of cannabis

905
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,558
a lot of the stuff you see from

906
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,400
commercial grows that i post is with the

907
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,240
nikon d3200

908
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,759
uh now it's a very affordable camera

909
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,319
because it's kind of old

910
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,599
um i do not use the auto settings i've

911
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,639
learned a couple of settings on there

912
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,480
once you get

913
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,159
your aperture setting right and your iso

914
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,599
setting right you'll learn exactly how

915
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,679
to shoot in a grow room

916
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,759
um so what i'm getting at now i've

917
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,679
upgraded i've actually got the uh the

918
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,440
sony a6400

919
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,798
which uh takes beautiful pictures but i

920
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,080
prefer it for the video camera it

921
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,519
doesn't move a lot right now that i've

922
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,960
got it set up in the video spot

923
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,400
it's beautiful but that's what i'm using

924
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,120
now you don't see a lot of photos from

925
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,038
that

926
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,798
um most of it comes from the nikon

927
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,400
because it's uh that's actually kept

928
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,240
near the grow space

929
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,080
so what i was going to get out with that

930
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,240
the most important part about your

931
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,278
photography equipment in my opinion

932
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,640
is understand the tool you have got if

933
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,159
you're using an iphone

934
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,240
if you're using an android phone if

935
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,159
you're using a canon camera a nikon

936
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,919
camera a sony camera

937
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,559
learn that device but i don't think you

938
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,520
uh need a device that is above your

939
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,399
skill level

940
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,240
i've got the sony uh which is this one

941
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,679
the a6400

942
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,200
the a73 would take a much better photo a

943
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,759
much better video

944
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,278
but it's got so many buttons and so many

945
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,200
settings that i think

946
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,398
it would just stumble me it would trip

947
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,319
me up and confuse me

948
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,079
more than it would help me to be

949
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,639
productive i've got the highest

950
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,398
camera that i think i could understand

951
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,000
to be productive in a couple of years

952
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,678
once i understand all these settings and

953
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,359
tools and tricks i will upgrade

954
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,038
to that a7 3 by then there will be

955
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,678
something better out it'll be the

956
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,640
a [ __ ] 22 5 or some [ __ ] and we'll

957
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,519
get that one but

958
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,919
you see what i'm saying uh just get the

959
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,480
best

960
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,159
tool that you can understand i am not a

961
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
professional guitar player so i don't

962
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,880
have

963
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,559
[ __ ] les paul guitars and amplifiers

964
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,399
everywhere i'm a half-assed guitar

965
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,918
player so i've got a yamaha acoustic on

966
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:57,599
a standard that's dusty

967
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,038
get the best that you can handle don't

968
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,719
get something out of your league that's

969
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,480
going to intimidate you

970
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,839
cameras can be confusing if you don't

971
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,038
know what you're doing i honestly don't

972
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,720
know what any of those buttons and

973
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,240
settings mean i had to learn all of that

974
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,480
stuff on the fly

975
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,679
um i learned all of it on youtube

976
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,519
honestly so

977
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,960
know know the gear that you've got learn

978
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,158
the gear that you've got the best it's

979
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,240
not about having the best

980
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,679
gear it's about mastering the gear that

981
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,960
you do have

982
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,640
um then where are we gonna go

983
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,000
there's a big learning curve when you do

984
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,360
get a new camera

985
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,599
you're gonna think oh i'm gonna point

986
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,038
this camera at the [ __ ] plants and

987
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,959
take a picture

988
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,398
there's so many settings to play with

989
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,840
like i talked about before

990
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,678
that you're gonna have to figure out how

991
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,879
to shoot in your environment

992
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,240
a big tip and you can't do this

993
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,000
everywhere if i did this in some

994
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,440
commercial environments the uh

995
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,960
lead grower the owner would come and

996
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,360
throw a [ __ ] fit turn off the grow

997
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,360
lights

998
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,038
in my personal grow space i unplug the

999
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,158
grow lights when i'm taking pictures now

1000
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,079
it's dark in there

1001
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,600
and i turn on a fluorescent light and we

1002
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,000
just got normal white lighting in the

1003
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,558
room the 4800 or the 48k

1004
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,319
4800 kelvin that's what i'm looking for

1005
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,678
uh that color looks really good for

1006
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,879
photography and for lighting that's what

1007
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,720
i got going on right here those are at

1008
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,159
4800k is what i believe the lighting in

1009
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,600
front of me is the one behind me

1010
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,960
different spectrum don't judge me by

1011
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,398
that one i just did that for ambience

1012
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,319
behind me these two in front

1013
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,639
4800k is where they are set i think

1014
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,398
that's a beautiful color for photography

1015
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,840
uh so just use a fluorescent light turn

1016
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:20,798
off the grow lights use a fluorescent

1017
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,839
light in there

1018
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:27,599
um the more lighting the better

1019
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:29,519
um let's talk about the shot um

1020
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,759
it doesn't matter how good your gear is

1021
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,440
if you can't frame a shot if you don't

1022
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,879
can't get your subject right you're not

1023
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,640
going to take a good photo

1024
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
think look at what you're shooting think

1025
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,880
about the subject

1026
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,798
get the subject in the shot and then

1027
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,399
don't have a bunch of extra stuff in the

1028
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:44,960
shot if you can clean up the background

1029
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:46,558
i know where

1030
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,079
a lot of us are taking pictures in the

1031
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:49,119
garden we're in the grow so we can't

1032
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,119
just move everything out of the

1033
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,558
background if you can move that plant

1034
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,558
in front of a background like this

1035
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,319
curtain behind me or a cool color

1036
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,759
or a contrasting color something that's

1037
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,278
not green if you can put it in front of

1038
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,879
black or purple or

1039
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,398
blue or something like that to make the

1040
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,919
greens and the reds pop out

1041
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,278
that's always a good idea don't put it

1042
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,600
right against the background put it

1043
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,599
about a foot off of the background and

1044
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,639
lots of lighting but think about what's

1045
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,278
behind

1046
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,200
that picture do you want to see like a

1047
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,720
bunch of crates and five gallon buckets

1048
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,759
and maybe the toilet or something like

1049
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,120
that you don't want to see all that dumb

1050
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,000
[ __ ] in the background we want to see a

1051
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,439
beautiful

1052
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,119
pleasing picture everything in the

1053
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,679
picture should catch my eye and make me

1054
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,918
go

1055
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,240
oh that's a nice shot we don't need to

1056
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,320
see your ph pen that's all crusty

1057
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:37,200
and the floor that's dirty and [ __ ] like

1058
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:38,558
that give us a pleasant shot

1059
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,919
what's the goal of your shot what are

1060
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,519
you trying to show me what do you want

1061
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,960
me to see

1062
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,720
as the photographer it's your

1063
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,360
responsibility to show me

1064
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,720
what you wanted me to see all i've got

1065
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,519
is this picture you're not going to be

1066
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,278
there to say

1067
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,879
look at those trichomes if you want me

1068
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,480
to look at those trichomes

1069
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,480
get those trichomes in the shot that's

1070
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,319
all you got to do the one picture is

1071
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,679
your opportunity to tell me the story so

1072
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,918
frame it the way you want it

1073
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,038
get it framed up in there like the shot

1074
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,480
you're looking at right now there's not

1075
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,079
a bunch of junk in the background not a

1076
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,360
bunch of junk in the sides

1077
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,639
if you do take a picture and there's a

1078
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,240
bunch of [ __ ] on the sides of your

1079
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,278
picture don't be afraid to crop it you

1080
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,079
could trim out the sides of your

1081
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:13,839
pictures

1082
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,439
like over here off camera there's some

1083
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,798
recording equipment you can't even see

1084
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,399
you think this room looks super clean

1085
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:19,679
and organized no there's a mess right

1086
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,119
there you can't even see it

1087
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,120
but we just crop it out make it look

1088
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,639
super good and super professional

1089
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,319
nobody has to know about that stuff

1090
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,559
unless you tell them

1091
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,158
so make the shot pleasing frame it have

1092
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,158
a good angle have a good background

1093
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,919
think about good colors

1094
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,919
uh colors that contrast your plant

1095
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,120
colors that complement your plant

1096
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,320
uh what are you trying to highlight i've

1097
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,759
talked about this a little bit are you

1098
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,439
trying to highlight the trichomes the

1099
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,960
colors the leaf shape

1100
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,720
uh the density of the buzz are you

1101
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,038
trying to show me the whole plant

1102
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,798
get what you want in that shot step back

1103
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,240
step forward move around

1104
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:51,759
don't be afraid to move around in the

1105
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,440
ground sometimes i'll be in there

1106
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,798
hanging off of a step ladder with one

1107
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,399
foot on the stepladder and one foot

1108
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:57,038
against the wall leaning up against the

1109
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,199
door

1110
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,558
[ __ ] precariously trying to get these

1111
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,480
shots

1112
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,678
get the shots you need get in there take

1113
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,599
that shot

1114
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,278
then when it's time when it's possible

1115
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,719
move that plant somewhere better so you

1116
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:09,200
can put it in front of a good background

1117
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,038
put it

1118
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,399
about a foot off of the background put

1119
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,440
some good lighting on it

1120
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:18,000
then start getting photos there um

1121
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,120
lighting lighting lighting lighting is

1122
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,200
amazing

1123
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,759
the more lighting the better in my

1124
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,120
opinion you can't add light to a photo

1125
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:26,480
once you take it you can adjust the

1126
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,959
exposure a little bit

1127
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,640
but you can't add lighting to a photo

1128
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,120
you can take lighting out later

1129
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,559
so the more lighting is [ __ ] the

1130
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,278
better in my opinion that's what i'm

1131
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:36,879
getting at

1132
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,640
lighting lighting lighting light it from

1133
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,559
all angles if you can light it from the

1134
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,360
bottom up from the back forward from the

1135
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,960
front back

1136
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,879
the more lighting the better that takes

1137
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,519
out your shadows that takes out all the

1138
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,278
weirdness

1139
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,880
it makes it easier to edit then later on

1140
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,720
when you learn photo stacking

1141
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,000
uh you've just got so many more options

1142
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,440
we're not even going to talk about photo

1143
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,839
stacking now that's a whole nother ball

1144
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
game

1145
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,639
shout out to the people who try to teach

1146
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,919
me that i just simply don't have the

1147
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,399
patience for it

1148
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,759
i get it but that's a lot of time you

1149
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,239
photographers are crazy

1150
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,119
um lighting lighting lighting uh light

1151
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,359
that [ __ ] up

1152
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,879
uh the 4800 kelvin lighting is beautiful

1153
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,719
put a light in front of it

1154
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,240
uh maybe take a couple of pictures with

1155
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,759
your flash and see what it does take a

1156
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,038
couple of pictures without the flash and

1157
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,558
see what it does you're gonna notice a

1158
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,240
huge difference

1159
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:19,839
if the lighting is not right the flash

1160
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,839
is going to give you shadows

1161
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,879
see where that shadow lies adjust your

1162
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,319
lighting there i've got

1163
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,919
two lights in front of me and a light

1164
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,158
behind me for this recording

1165
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,519
uh the light behind me separates me from

1166
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,720
my background i think it gives me a

1167
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,440
little bit of depth when you put the

1168
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,600
plants

1169
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,278
uh to the background and a light between

1170
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,240
them it'll provide depth it'll cut out a

1171
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:37,679
bunch of shadows

1172
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,359
that'll work really well that's a big

1173
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,080
photography secret put a light behind

1174
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,798
you

1175
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,798
um so the beauty the beauty about

1176
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,398
photography now

1177
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,079
we've come a long way we're digital

1178
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,558
we've got memory cards

1179
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,079
back in the day every photo costed you

1180
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:53,678
money costed money is that the

1181
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,398
appropriate has cost it a word i don't

1182
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,720
know

1183
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:57,918
back in the day every photo was an

1184
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,079
expense because

1185
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,360
film wasn't free every photo went on to

1186
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,960
a piece of film and it had to be

1187
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,798
developed in a dark room somebody had to

1188
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,319
go develop that film

1189
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,559
that got expensive that got time

1190
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,398
consuming now it's all digital

1191
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,679
now just [ __ ] spray and pray and take

1192
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,519
a bunch of shots

1193
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,960

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,919
we're just gonna say that my hand right

1197
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,440
here is my subject and my microphone is

1198
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,118

1199
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,320

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,519
you got the shot you want right now

1201
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,359
change the settings

1202
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:28,960
just change one or two settings a couple

1203
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,239
of directions take a couple more shots

1204
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,599
chop chop chop

1205
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,519
change the setting a couple more times

1206
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,800
take a couple more then when you're

1207
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,280
going through later on and looking at

1208
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,039
your photos that one that shines for you

1209
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,879
if you've got a good camera the settings

1210
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,440
will pop up on the camera and show you

1211
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,878
what settings you use to take that photo

1212
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,480
now is your chance to grab a pen and

1213
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,838
write down those settings and duplicate

1214
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,719
those settings the next time you go into

1215
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,239
the grow room

1216
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,759
just go in there and change that setting

1217
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,439
again or

1218
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,520
put your camera on auto and go into the

1219
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,960
room and take a couple of shots and then

1220
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,559
once it's on auto it's going to adjust

1221
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,838
itself for you find the setting you want

1222
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,358
and then kind of mimic that and play

1223
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:02,960
with it from there later

1224
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,480
i like to use the macro mode on the

1225
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,240
camera it's the one with a little tiny

1226
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,760
flower on it that gets me nice and close

1227
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,519
gets me some good close shots

1228
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,960
if i'm backing up i generally use that

1229
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,920
portrait mode

1230
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,199
you'll learn your camera one of the

1231
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,440
funnest parts about cameras

1232
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,799
and photography is there are no rules uh

1233
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,079
the only rules are like don't take

1234
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,280
pictures of the wrong person at the

1235
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,560
wrong time and don't get yourself in

1236
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,839
trouble you [ __ ] creep

1237
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,599
but the main part about photography

1238
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:26,960
there's no rules take pictures and have

1239
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,079
a good time you're not hurting anything

1240
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,119
it doesn't cost you a lot once you've

1241
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,039
got the gear

1242
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,960
the memory card is in there snap snap

1243
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,039
snap take a bunch of shots delete the

1244
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,039
ones you don't like repeat the process

1245
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,559
get better get more comfortable

1246
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,039
eventually you get to where you can just

1247
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,159
walk in

1248
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,599
you can set up your camera and go oh

1249
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,039
look there's the shot that we need and

1250
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,200
you take two shots

1251
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,320
you move over and you go and you go

1252
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,039
thank you guys that was ten thousand

1253
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,640
dollars

1254
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,320
they pay you ten g's and you go back to

1255
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,519
your studio and you edit a couple things

1256
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,079
for a couple of seconds and you send

1257
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,838
them their

1258
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,359
[ __ ] pristine photos it only took you

1259
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:56,480
two shots because you knew exactly what

1260
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:58,480
you were looking for

1261
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,079
you developed that photographer's eye

1262
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,440
you just look at a shot and you go oh

1263
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,800
that looks good right there the way that

1264
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,159
plant shines right there the way that

1265
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,039
leaf goes that direction in that

1266
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,799
direction

1267
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,320
you'll learn get this part of the plant

1268
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,000
in there and kind of crop this part out

1269
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,200
because it makes me want to see more get

1270
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,880
just the top of the bud in there and

1271
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,239
leave a little top for visual

1272
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,519
like you'll start seeing it then you'll

1273
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,039
learn the camera setting you'll say oh

1274
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,639
there's this much light in here

1275
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,719
i want to get this much depth in here i

1276
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,078
should use this lens let's go shebang

1277
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,000
and you'll take two shots

1278
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,440
like a [ __ ] sniper sniper gets one

1279
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,199
shot i want two angles

1280

00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,078
square

1301
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,640
if you look at most of my photos i am a

1302
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,720
seed

1303
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,239

ah the colors the textures the trichome

1306
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,240
level of the plants that are coming from

1307
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:17,598
my seeds i try to have a good clear

1308
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,719
background without a bunch of [ __ ] in

1309
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,960
the background

1310
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,639
uh good clear solid post that shows you

1311
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,559
exactly what you're looking at

1312
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,400
then i try to use somewhere between

1313
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,000
three and five hashtags if you use the

1314
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,599
same hashtag too many times

1315
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,440
they'll start blocking that hashtag

1316
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,200
they'll shadow ban it it won't get seen

1317
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,720
so rotate your hashtags pick three or

1318
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,480
five and stick with them

1319
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,000
also before you use those hashtags

1320
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,119
search them see if they have been shadow

1321
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,159
banned or blocked because they're

1322
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,559
blocking a lot of

1323
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,159
the cannabis community popular hashtags

1324
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,759
on social media now

1325
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,078
so make sure they aren't blocked also

1326
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,400
i've noticed that my stories get viewed

1327
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,400
more than my posts so maybe post in your

1328
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,838
stories post a post on instagram then

1329
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,599

1330
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,039

1332
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,358

1338
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,920

1339
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,599
to improve my chances right now i'm

1340
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,200
taking a break from selecting testers

1341
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,359
because i've got uh

1342
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,960
i'm in over my head i got a lot going on

1343
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,319
and i don't want to commit to sending

1344
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,679
out a bunch of test seeds to people

1345
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,880

getting reports

1347

1348
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,639
you written down i know who you are now

1349

you are now on my radar

1350
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,679
radar when it comes time to selecting

1351
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,279
testers your name does look familiar

1352
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,199

1353
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,839
now i know that you're on patreon

1354
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,598
that does help out a lot as well uh

1355
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,199
jethro earl thank you bro you gave me a

1356
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,960
good question to ramble on

1357
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,439
i hope i answered some questions

1358
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,240
honestly i think honesty is the best

1359
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,480
policy

1360
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:49,519
i am not a trained educated skilled

1361
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,320
photographer

1362
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,320
uh i am just i'm an idiot with a lot of

1363
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,240
experience to be quite honest with you

1364
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,599
uh i just did it until i figured it out

1365
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,719
i failed a few times but

1366
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,000
the best part about failing with

1367
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,439
photography is all you got to do is

1368
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,159
delete a couple photos nothing went

1369
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,000
wrong

1370
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,920
just wasted some space on a memory card

1371
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,159
a couple of flashes on the flash is all

1372
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,519
so um yeah get experience to get there

1373
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,960
and take pictures and then watch the

1374
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,159
settings that work for you

1375
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,480
modify repeat adjust and adapt and most

1376
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,879
importantly dude have fun with it

1377
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,760
have fun we've all been programmed and

1378
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,160
brainwashed

1379
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,760
to make all of our posts look exactly

1380
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,799
the same for social media when we scroll

1381
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,480
through social media

1382
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,000
it all looks basically the same there's

1383
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,000
a little we've all got the same

1384
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,920
filters there's like a little we're all

1385
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,679
we've all fallen into an algorithm

1386
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,720
accidentally to make our photos

1387
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:38,239
pleasing and appealing for social media

1388
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,000
get away from that have fun take

1389
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,159
pictures of what you love

1390
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,519
snap the images that you see that's what

1391
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,279
that's the beauty of the camera you've

1392
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,239
got the camera you get to capture

1393
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,599
what you see so get it the best you can

1394
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,439
uh it's like playing an instrument

1395
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,440
when i first got drums i didn't know how

1396
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,880
to say what i was thinking on the drums

1397
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,039
i would think booker took attack

1398
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,039
doom

1399
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,679
on top of it and i can think it and play

1400
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,200
it now eventually

1401
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:08,639
you'll get the same way with your camera

1402
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,759
you'll say oh i see that shot i want to

1403
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,279
get lighting here i want to get these

1404
