weather for too long

77
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,238
let's jump right into the main topic of

78
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,400
today's

79
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,400
podcast it has been brought to my

80
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,039
attention that i talk about

81
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,840
light leaks on this podcast quite

82
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,519
frequently

83
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
i've also been told that i have never

84
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
told you what a light leak

85
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,439
officially is so we're going to start

86
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,360
off by talking about light leaks in

87
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,639
today's episode

88
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,480
let's talk about it let's jump right

89
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,559
into it what is a light leak

90
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,318
when we are growing cannabis plants

91
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,039
those plants do need a dark

92
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,318
cycle to flower if we want to initiate

93
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,318
the flowering period

94
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,439
of cannabis plants of photoperiod

95
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,399
cannabis plants if you've got

96
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,400
autoflowers

97
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
this is a different story however i'm

98
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,319
going to talk about photoperiod cannabis

99
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,719
plants for this example when we're

100
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,039
growing photo period cannabis plants

101
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,479
those plants require an amount of time

102
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,120
of uninterrupted

103
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,639
total darkness and i mean complete total

104
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,759
darkness if you can see your hand in

105
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,919
front of your face

106
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,518
it is too bright in that room i need you

107
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,958
to stand in that room for a few minutes

108
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,640
and let your eyes adjust

109
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,560
and once your eyes adjust put your hand

110
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,439
in front of your face and if you can see

111
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,439
your hand

112
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,959
there is too much light in there we need

113
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,000
complete total

114
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,759
darkness so during the 12 12-hour

115
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
dark cycle which we give our plants to

116
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,039
initiate them to flower most people do a

117
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,680
12 hours on

118
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,280
12 hours off cycle that's a 24-hour day

119
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
they're awake for 12 hours they sleep

120
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,560
for 12 hours

121
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,158
that 12-hour uninterrupted dark period

122
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,039
will trigger our plants to go into

123
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,598
flower

124
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,479
now it is very important that we do not

125
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,639
interrupt

126
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,238
that dark cycle that is what i call a

127
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,079
light leak when we get light

128
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,000
into the night cycle of the plants we

129
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,159
don't want to wake the plants up we

130
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,400
don't want to disrupt their sleep cycle

131
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,158
if we disrupt that sleep cycle we can

132
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,680
cause problems with the plants we can

133
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,560
cause minor problems

134
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,920
or we can cause major problems depending

135
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,199
on when these light leaks happen

136
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,679
depending on how long

137
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,438
how often they happen that will depend

138
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,040
also it'll depend on the genetics do

139
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,680
those genetics have a tendency to have

140
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,079
problems

141
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,120
due to light leaks or not but the things

142
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,439
we can see

143
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,640
if we do cause light leaks in our grow

144
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,400
can be things like

145
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,719
intersex traits we can trigger the

146
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
plants to throw intersex traits

147
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,478
normally in nature once the sun goes

148
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,280
down it's [ __ ] dark until the sun

149
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,358
comes up

150
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,119
what would happen if one day the sun

151
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,439
came up in the middle of the night

152
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,000
your whole rhythm your whole life would

153
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,160
freak out you would go into panic mode

154
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
imagine if some lights come on in the

155
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
middle of the night in the grow room

156
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
they're going to go into panic mode

157
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,679
they're going to say why is the sun

158
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
coming up

159
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,199
i don't know what to do that weird

160
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,519
stress that weird panic mode

161
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
often causes plants to throw intersex

162
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,159
traits

163
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,240
the plants want to survive their goal is

164
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,000
to reproduce so they can be grown next

165
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,160
year cannabis plants are annuals

166
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,199
they last one season they produce seeds

167
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,880
if they're pollinated

168
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,800
then they are gone we aren't going to

169
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,439
pollinate these plants that's not our

170
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,680
intention

171
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,600
but if we do give them some stress they

172
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,439
may decide hey the end is near or

173
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,919
something's wrong i better do what i can

174
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,918
do

175
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,599
to make sure i have self-preservation so

176
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,079
i can continue my genetics

177
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,919
so then it will show intersex traits it

178
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,399
will make male parts it will make female

179
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,159
parts

180
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,560
it will pollinate itself and we will

181
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,400
have seeded hermaphroditic plants

182
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,399
that's not something we want so let's

183
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,918
not get light leaks into the grow room

184
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,679
once those lights go off

185
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,279
leave the lights off don't go in that

186
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,079
grow room don't go in there and take

187
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,519
pictures

188
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,359
don't turn on a white to show one of

189
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,918
your friends leave them

190
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
in the dark let them sleep we can cause

191
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,159
intersex traits

192
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,639
we can also cause them to not flower at

193
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
all

194
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,759
if you've got a light shining into your

195
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
grow room when you think it is the dark

196
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,560
cycle

197
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,159
those plants just won't go into flower

198
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
you will have turned your timer to 12

199
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
12 you'll be waiting and waiting and

200
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,800
waiting it's usually about

201
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,400
10 to 14 maybe 12-ish days in when we

202
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,478
start seeing the plants actually showing

203
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,120
us that they are in flower you may not

204
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,839
see that

205
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,600
so if you've been in flower for 14 15 16

206
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,239
days and you're not seeing any signs of

207
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
flower

208
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
there is a light leak in that room

209
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,478
you're getting white when it should be

210
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,479
dark

211
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,000
also something else that can happen

212
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,159
depending on when the light

213
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
leaks the light interruptions do happen

214
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
you can re-veg

215
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,439
your plants your plants can be in flower

216
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,879
for a number of weeks

217
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,240
and then something goes wrong to where

218
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,439
you are getting a light leak that you

219
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,360
don't even know about

220
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,360
now you're getting extra light those

221
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800
plants may go back into the vegetative

222
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
stage and they won't even finish

223
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
flowering

224
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,439
you'll have these weird funky looking

225
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,318
buds and you'll have plants with twisted

226
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,439
world leaves

227
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,199
and you'll be like what the heck is

228
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,719
going on in there that's when we're

229
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
gonna do a test and you should do this

230
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
test

231
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,319
long before you get to this point but

232
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
here's how to test if you have a light

233
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,439
leak

234
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,159
go in the grow room turn off all of the

235
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,079
lights

236
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,000
you got to hang out in that room for 5

237
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,079
10 maybe 15 minutes and allow your

238
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,038
eyeballs to adjust to that total

239
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,198
pitch black dark room now at this point

240
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,839
hold your hand in front of your face

241
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,038
if you can see your hand or any movement

242
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,959
i'm white and pasty

243
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,279
any light is going to reflect off of my

244
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,318
hand if i see any light in that room

245
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:06,159
it is too much light we need

246
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,720
100 percent pitch black total darkness

247
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
in this night period so when i say a

248
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
light leak

249
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,879
i am talking about an interruption of

250
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,959
the dark cycle

251
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,478
it could be opening the door and getting

252
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,239
light from the other room in there

253
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,918
it could be a hole in some of your

254
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,439
ducting or a hole in your tent that is

255
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,598
letting light from the other room

256
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,598
blatantly into there you're going to see

257
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,159
that lightly cause a hermaphroditic

258
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:27,360
issue

259
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
right where the light is hitting your

260
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,160
bud that one little bud is going to

261
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,560
throw male flowers

262
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,560
and it may pollinate it may create seeds

263
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,639
so be very careful when it comes to

264
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,759
light leaks we do not want light leaks

265
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,360
in our grow

266
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,439
i think i've talked about light leaks a

267
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,199
lot we want to stand in the grow room

268
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,120
and make sure it is totally dark

269
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
if it is not totally dark we need to

270
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
correct that

271
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
something you may notice is that some of

272
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,639
the equipment

273
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,279
in your grow room may be putting off

274
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,199
lights

275
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,198
some of the grow equipment that we buy

276
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,639
has blue led lighting on it some of it

277
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,038
has red lighting on it

278
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,079
the only light that is acceptable in

279
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,279
that grow room

280
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,758
is a green led light since plants are

281
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,359
green

282
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
they are not affected by green light

283
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
they just reflect the green light they

284
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
don't even see it they know it's they

285
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,319
don't even know it's there

286
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,159
so if you've got a green led light that

287
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,199
is the only light that is acceptable in

288
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,960
your grow

289
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,160
a lot of us have equipment with a power

290
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,198
light when you plug it in this little

291
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
light comes on

292
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,639
if you've got a red light if you've got

293
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
a blue light on any of your equipment

294
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
it is time to get some black duct tape

295
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,000
or something similar

296
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,079
and cover that light up we do not need

297
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,719
any lights happening in our grow

298
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
while the plants are trying to sleep

299
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,599
cover up

300
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,680
all those lights if you've got a green

301
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,719
light that light will be acceptable

302
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,838
if it is an led we can use green leds

303
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,240
but don't use

304
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,760
a white light with a green painted

305
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,360
bubble over it that is still going to

306
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,360
cause problems the light coming out is

307
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,440
not really green it's got a green bubble

308
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,440
it's not green light so if you're using

309
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,560
any sort of lights in there it should be

310
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,279
a green led with green diodes

311
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,879
not green bulbs not painted green bulbs

312
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,120
we actually want green

313
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,919
light not green glass to keep those

314
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,879
plants in

315
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,639
an uninterrupted dark cycle something

316
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,919
that was brought to my attention

317
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,958
is if you are using an ac infinity fan

318
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,278
speed controller sometimes those will

319
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,039
come

320
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,759
on the little controller box with the

321
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,360
numbers on it sometimes that comes on

322
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,120
randomly so you may think that that

323
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,879
controller is off there's a little

324
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
button to turn off the lights

325
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,480
it's been brought to my attention that

326
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,080
occasionally that thing will light up

327
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
during the dark cycle and when you go in

328
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,399
the grow room the next day that light is

329
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,278
on and you had no idea that that was on

330
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,360
so if you've got the ac infinity fan

331
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,639
speed controller with the display on it

332
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,519
you may want to make a little light

333
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,799
baffle you can simply get something like

334
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,039
a piece of cardboard

335
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,479
a piece of a piece of a shoe box and

336
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,919
just cut a little flap and tape that

337
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
flap right over it's where you can lift

338
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,838
it up

339
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,879
you can adjust and look at your clock

340
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,519
settings and look what you need to

341
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,439
adjust

342
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,879
put the flap right back down maybe

343
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,080
you've got another creative method of

344
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,399
doing so but

345
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,278
let's cover all of the equipment that is

346
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,320
putting off

347
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,000
led red blue purple lighting in our grow

348
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,320
room we do not need that lighting in

349
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,720
there that is going to cause us problems

350
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,560
if it is a green led that is acceptable

351
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,680
now i understand sometimes we do need to

352
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,919
go in the grow room

353
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,278
during the dark cycle and work maybe

354
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,799
something happened maybe you're

355
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,320
hanging out and you heard a word heard a

356
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,679
weird bumping noise or maybe the air

357
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,200
conditioner didn't come on

358
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,719
or maybe you forgot something in there

359
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
maybe you left your phone in there

360
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,639
also if it is the dark period don't be

361
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,879
in there with your phone

362
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,919
that counts as light i've seen people in

363
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,120
the grow room

364
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,559
and they're like i'll just use my light

365
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,839
as a flashlight and i won't disrupt the

366
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,838
plants bro that's a light

367
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,040
that that is light the plants are waking

368
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,560
up from that so

369
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,240
don't answer your phone don't use your

370
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,439
phone as a flashlight in the grow room

371
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,600
in the dark period

372
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
if you're going to go in the grow during

373
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,440
a dark period

374
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,199
i highly recommend having green led

375
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
lights as your work lights

376
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,440
it is a good idea just to replace every

377
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,519
bulb in there with a green light

378
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
and you can't just use green light bulbs

379
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,039
they need to actually be putting out

380
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,719
green light be very careful about that

381
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,078
some of the painted bulbs i don't trust

382
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,680
i would definitely prefer

383
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,199
a green diode led light so

384
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,639
if you're going to work in there get

385
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,839
yourself a green light a lot of people

386
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,799
wear the headlamp with the green

387
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,720
headlamp on it

388
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,000
that way the light is shining wherever

389
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
you're looking you can highlight your

390
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,639
space

391
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,079
that is cool it kind of makes me feel

392
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,919
weird in there like that i would rather

393
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,000
have the green leds above the

394
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,679
above me so that i can see the room just

395
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
something creepy about not being able to

396
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,599
see

397
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,519
over here but only being able to see in

398
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,399
front of me in the dark messes with my

399
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,759
perception and

400
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,958
ah just feels kind of creepy to be

401
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,759
honest with you i'm not afraid of the

402
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,919
dark

403
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,000
maybe i'm afraid of the dark my point is

404
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,919
do not interrupt that dark cycle

405
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,240
when you interrupt that dark cycle that

406
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,360
is what i am calling a light leak it is

407
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
fully dark in there

408
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,879
now we've got some light coming in that

409
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,959
is a light leak it's just like having

410
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,639
uh an aquarium with a leak the water is

411
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,239
getting out or the water is getting in

412
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,079
we're getting air or i'm sorry we're

413
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,639
getting light in or out when we don't

414
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,879
want it

415
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,320
that is a light leak and it can cause

416
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,799
great problems to your garden

417
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,760
depending on your genetics a small light

418
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,838
leak could be

419
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,240
seriously detrimental or a small light

420
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,320
leak maybe just a tiny problem but

421
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
let's avoid all of the problems we can

422
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,839
by understanding light leaks

423
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,839
and avoiding them i think i covered that

424
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,600
quite well they'll cause hermaphrodites

425
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,760
they'll cause your plants not to flower

426
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,320
and they can also cause your plant to go

427
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,600
into a reveg situation pay attention

428
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,440
that some of your equipment

429
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
may have lights on it a lot of the fans

430
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,120
we buy with the timer

431
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,800
if you can set a timer on your fan it's

432
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,720
probably got a red light on it

433
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,838
you've got to go and put some tape over

434
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,680
that some of the extension cords we buy

435
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,519
have lights on them they got the little

436
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,120
on off switch and it's either red or

437
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560
blue or whatever

438
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,000
you don't want that light switch with

439
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,958
that little switch the on off switch

440
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,120
with the light on it

441
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,399
you don't want that some of the power

442
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,919
strips that we buy

443
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,600
light up when we plug them in they're

444
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,278
clear thin plat

445
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,639
thin clear plastic that's what i meant

446
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:55,439
when you plug it in the whole strip

447
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,799
lights up

448
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
get rid of that piece of [ __ ] we don't

449
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,120
want that in there get a dark

450
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,559
colored power strip a black one so the

451
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,078
light won't shine through it

452
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,439
a lot of them have a little light on the

453
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:06,239
end to indicate that they're giving you

454
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,920
power

455
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,600
take a screwdriver and [ __ ] puncture

456
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,199
that light bulb or put some tape over it

457
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,320
or drill through it or get some pliers

458
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,399
and pull it out

459
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,639
ruin that light bulb we don't need extra

460
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,919
light in there the only light we want is

461
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,959
from our grow lights

462
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,240
unless again it is a green led light

463
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,399
i feel like i covered that part

464
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,079
excessively i think i made my point

465
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,240
light leaks are when we get light in in

466
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:28,958
the dark period and it disrupts our

467
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,600
plants

468
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,838
the next thing i want to touch on is

469
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,720
watering

470
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,519
technique the other day i was helping

471
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,839
somebody

472
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,120
do a consultation for a grow and i said

473
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,240
just show me what you do in here and i

474
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,039
just kind of hang out while they do

475
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,360
their thing

476
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,278
and i learn what is going wrong in their

477
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,199
grow by watching what they're doing

478
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,958
and i watch this person get their

479
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,000
watering container they just scoop water

480
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,399
up out of a bucket

481
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and then they poured the water basically

482
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,600
down the stock of the plant

483
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,919
right into the middle of the pot they

484
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,560
got a seven gallon pot that's full of uh

485
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,078
it was a soilless mix so they got uh

486
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,838
just it's filled with the soilless mix

487
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,439
uh seven gallons of media they got a

488
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,519
good sized plant coming out of there

489
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,480
and they are watering the direct center

490
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,399
of the plant

491
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,399
so you got this big seven gallon pot and

492
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,600
they just poured i'm gonna guess a seven

493
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,000
gallon pot is

494
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
18 inches around that's my guess that's

495
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,759
close enough even if i'm wrong

496
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
they watered a four to six inch circle

497
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,759
in the middle

498
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,639
now what about all this other 14 10

499
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,240
inches

500
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,519
on the outside that didn't get water

501
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,919
that's where all of our roots are

502
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
growing

503
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,759
we want to fill that entire pot with

504
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,120
roots if you don't provide water to that

505
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,799
outer edge

506
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,240
how is it going to get wet what are the

507
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,759
roots going to do they're not going to

508
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,159
grow out there you're just going to have

509
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,120
i bet that my friends plants only have

510
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,919
root balls

511
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,440
that are probably 8 to 10 inches around

512
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,719
and the depth of the pot

513
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,800
when most people could achieve a full

514
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,480
root bound pot that whole pot should be

515
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,240
filled with roots by the time this plant

516
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,000
is done but if you're not watering it

517
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,759
those roots will not go there there's no

518
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,440
reason they're just dry it's like ah

519
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,799
it's dry over there let's stay over here

520
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
where it's wet because he's only

521
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,519
watering in the middle so think about

522
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,439
this

523
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,159
look at the shape of an untopped

524
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,320
untrained unmanipulated cannabis plant

525
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,838
if you visualize that plant in your head

526
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,160
it's shaped like a christmas tree right

527
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,839
it's

528
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,838
skinny at the top and it gets wider as

529
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,440
it goes down think about the shape of

530
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,240
the leaves the leaves are hanging down a

531
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
little bit

532
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,959
kind of acting like shingles on a roof

533
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,639
that one leaf hangs down at an angle

534
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,638
and if water were to land on the top of

535
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,440
the plant the water would run down that

536
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,759
top leaf

537
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,480
and then it would fall onto another leaf

538
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,800
and it would run

539
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,639
down and as it runs down it is also

540
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,399
moving outward because the branches are

541
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,240
getting wider the leaves are wider

542
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,559
it runs down and out down and out until

543
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,320
it gets to the bottom because of gravity

544
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,799
where is that water going to end up if

545
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,920
we picture water falling from above on a

546
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,519
cannabis plant

547
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,120
if you really think about it everything

548
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,600
directly underneath the plant will

549
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,240
remain

550
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,240
dry unless we get enough water what's

551
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,879
going to happen is the area right around

552
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,639
the plant

553
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,000
where those leaves stretch out too all

554
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,519
of that is going to get heavily

555
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,360
saturated with water

556
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,799
then those roots are going to say look

557
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,000
at all this water out here and they're

558
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,799
going to grow and they're going to

559
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,159
expand

560
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,399
and they're going to keep stretching out

561
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,159
until they don't see any more water

562
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,360
what's going to happen in your container

563
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,838
is they're going to go right up to the

564
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,199
wall

565
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,320
and they're going to circle back around

566
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:15,679
and they're going to keep circling in

567
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
there and you will fill that entire

568
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,599
container

569
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,440
with big fat white roots and big fat

570
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,159
white roots will give you big

571
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,440
fat green fruits if you've got a big fat

572
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,519
healthy root system

573
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,639
you can create a bigger fatter healthier

574
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,399
plant so

575
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,639
when you are watering my point of this

576
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,278
is don't water the very center of the

577
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,440
plant

578
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,958
water the outside edge of the plant if

579
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
you've got a new plant a baby plant

580
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,479
that's just adjusting to its space

581
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,838
yes water in the middle where the plant

582
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,600
is but as it grows

583
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,600
as the roots grow as the root mass

584
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,519
expands water outward

585
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,120
water more of that space where the fresh

586
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,639
roots are you may need to

587
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
increase the amount of water my buddy

588
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,240
was only pouring enough water in

589
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,839
to actually water the area where the

590
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,440
plant probably exists

591
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,120
i told him if he watered the entire

592
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
thing and got about 10 to 20 percent

593
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
runoff

594
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,279
the roots would grow more rapidly more

595
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,959
vigorous vigorously

596
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,480
and it would just fill and occupy that

597
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,640
entire plant which would give them a

598
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,400
healthier happier plant which produces

599
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,240
bigger fatter buds and that's

600
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,679
what we are all after right if you're

601
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,000
going to do it do it right

602
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,079
so stop watering the dead center of the

603
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,078
plant and let's start watering outward

604
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,798
so that all of those roots can get some

605
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,399
moisture and get a little bit of a drink

606
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:25,838
i've got one more quick thing i want to

607
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,720
rant about and then we're going to wrap

608
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,399
this one up

609
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,160
something i saw on social media was

610
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
somebody asking about a new brand of

611
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,200
soil they can buy

612
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,240
because this brand that they have been

613
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,400
buying is riddled with bugs

614
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,759
they wanted to blame the brand of soil

615
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,519
and then a couple of people wanted to

616
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,679
back them up on the facebook feed

617
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,480
because that's how social media works

618
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,120
but i want to say that you cannot blame

619
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
any brand of soil for having bugs in it

620
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,959
because

621
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,080
all brands of soil can potentially and

622
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,720
probably do

623
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,399
have bugs in there it's not happening at

624
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,038
the factory it's not happening

625
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,640
where the soil is made it could be but

626
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,798
most likely it's happening

627
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
somewhere in shipping or in a storage

628
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,240
dock i'm sure that the people that make

629
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,640
that soil do their best to keep it

630
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,120
bug-free they want you to have success

631
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,400
but these bags of soil are made in bulk

632
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,079
they're made in mass

633
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,759
they've got to sit on a dock or in a

634
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,759
warehouse or somewhere

635
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,038
i've been to a few grow stores where

636
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,359
they store the soil

637
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,480
in the backyard just right on the dirt

638
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,399
in the backyard

639
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,519
and there will be a stack of your

640
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,759
favorite soil

641
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,558
just two pallets of it stacked up eight

642
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,480
feet tall

643
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,558
then right next to that will be two

644
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,519
pallets stacked up eight feet tall of my

645
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,200
favorite soil

646
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,639
then right next to that will be another

647
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,279
soil that neither one of us have ever

648
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,038
heard of

649
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,879
but it's stacked up eight feet tall on

650
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,599
two pallets and it's all out in the

651
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,200
backyard

652
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,879
of this grow store or out in the

653
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
backyard of this warehouse because they

654
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
can't store it all indoors

655
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,360
and soil can be stored outdoors that's

656
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,159
safe they got a fence no one's gonna

657
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,079
steal it

658
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,000
but when all that [ __ ] is sitting

659
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,839
outdoors that's when it is getting

660
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,440
bugs and do you think that the bugs are

661
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,038
going to just say i want

662
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,558
this dirt they're going to go no there's

663
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,440
a home over here there's a home here and

664
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,960
there's a home here

665
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,400
they're going to get into all those bags

666
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,679
of dirt and then what are they going to

667
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,120
do they're going to breed

668
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,200
they've got a comfy environment they're

669
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,558
in a bag it's nice and cozy in there

670
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
it's warm it's dry

671
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,720
they're going to start partying they're

672
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,839
going to want to eat they're going to

673
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,919
want to hump and they're going to

674
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,079
reproduce

675
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,759
maybe there were only bugs in pile a at

676
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,439
the beginning but after a little bit of

677
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,038
eating and reproducing they wanted to go

678
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
find more people to eat and reproduce

679
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,599
with

680
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:30,399
now they're in pile two now they're in

681
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,519
pile three so the bugs are not in one

682
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,519
specific brand of soil or soilless mix

683
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,599
the bugs are moving around in all of the

684
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,240
brands of soil and soilless makes it's

685
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,839
happening

686
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,839
in the warehouse it's happening in the

687
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,119
dock it's happening in transport it's

688
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,798
happening in shipping

689
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,439
there are so many opportunities for

690
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,759
these bugs to jump into the soil bags

691
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,038
and we cannot blame the soil company

692
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,960
it's happening

693
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,319
it may not even happen anywhere near the

694
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,919
soil company it may have happened at the

695
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,678
grow store that sold it to you

696
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,679
which is as far down the line from the

697
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,038
company as you can get so let's stop

698
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,360
blaming the companies

699
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,359
for having bugs in the soil or soilless

700
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,639
mix that is something that you

701
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:11,678
should expect from all companies and

702
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,440
as a farmer it is your responsibility

703
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,519
to make sure there are no pests and if

704
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,840
there are pests it's your responsibility

705
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,158
to treat appropriately to ensure that

706
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,000
those pests don't infest our garden that

707
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,799
is the responsibility of

708
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,519
the gardener i can't put a bag of dirt

709
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,200
in a bag

710
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,279
and ship it across the country on a

711
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,120
truck and have it sit in a dock

712
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,720
and promise you that no bugs can get to

713
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,519
that that is impossible

714
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,759
therefore it is the growers

715
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,519
responsibility

716
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,119
to make sure that the things we put into

717
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,558
our garden are clean

718
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,199
and safe and pest free so inspect your

719
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,720
soil

720
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,240
if you get soil and you see things

721
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,519
flying out of it you've obviously got

722
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,440
some fungus gnats

723
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,720
you can't see a lot of the insects until

724
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,120
it's too late but

725
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,038
pay close attention if you do see any

726
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,079
soil-borne pests it is time to treat

727
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:57,919
that soil

728
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,599
a lot of people wonder how can i get the

729
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,799
bugs out of my soil there are several

730
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,279
ways to do that

731
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,639
the most common uh you can use predator

732
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,480
bugs that is very common

733
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
the most common way to get rid of most

734
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,919
bugs in a commercial environment

735
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,280
is to use bt bacillus thuringiensis i

736
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,480
hope i said that right i do not have

737
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,079
that printed anywhere

738
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,079
but that is the most common way to get

739
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,599
rid of most pests in soil

740
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,279
that product is available in many

741
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,359
different forms uh

742
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,038
mosquito dunks are very affordable there

743
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,918
are these products called mosquito dunks

744
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,480
you can find them

745
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,600
at your local hardware stores target

746
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,919
probably has them

747
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,359
the grocery store probably has them they

748
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,200
come on a red package

749
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,519
with yellow writing yellow and white

750
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,480
writing and it simply says mosquito dunk

751
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,639
they look like a

752
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,679
a little donut or a shitty cookie but do

753
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,320
not eat them

754
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,759
it is a beneficial fungus and i think

755
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,399
they are delivered on

756
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,319
it's i think it's like ground corn or

757
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,919
some sort of a uh

758
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,918
some sort of a i forgot what it is now

759
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
some sort of a grain but it's dried and

760
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,320
it's got

761
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,678
this bacteria on it so you get these

762
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,558
donut shaped discs

763
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,880
and i usually put them in a paper uh in

764
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:02,480
a

765
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,480
baggie and i wrap the baggie in a

766
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,759
newspaper and i crush it with the hammer

767
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,279
i don't beat the [ __ ] out of it i don't

768
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,279
want to break the baggie and

769
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,359
rupture the paper i just want to hit it

770
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,158
hard enough to crumble it up into a dust

771
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,599
then i put that dust into my water that

772
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,520
i'm going to water my plants

773
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,959
and then i water that through the soil

774
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,038
and that puts the bt

775
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,079
into my soil and that will destroy

776
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:23,839
eradicate

777
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,359
most of the bugs that come with your

778
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,599
soil

779
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,119
if the bt doesn't get rid of them that's

780
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,399
when i recommend doing either

781
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:35,119
an evergreen or botanic garden max

782
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,640
soil dredge you can mix up the

783
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,239
appropriate amount of pesticide

784
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
depending on which pesticide you've

785
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,599
chosen to use

786
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,199
mix that up with some water and simply

787
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,519
feed that through your plants until you

788
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,360
get

789
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,359
slight runoff now you've got that

790
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,639
pesticide in there in the root zone

791
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,558
hopefully your plants are nice and

792
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,159
healthy you didn't cause too much damage

793
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,399
it will only take a day or two for them

794
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,520
to recover continue on with your normal

795
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,720
watering cycle

796
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,720
and hopefully one or two soil dredges

797
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,640
of either botanic garden max or

798
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,759
evergreen will eradicate

799
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,360
almost any soil-borne pest

800
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,038
also you may want to spray at the same

801
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,918
time if you think you've got a soil

802
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,200
borne pest

803
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,440
if you think you've got thrips in there

804
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,360
if you think you got spider mites spray

805
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,038
at the same time as you do your dredge

806
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,319
hit them from all angles that way those

807
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,720
bugs have nowhere to go

808
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,678
and you win but we have got to stop

809
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,880
blaming

810
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,720
soil companies cocoa companies for

811
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,559
sabotaging our gardens because we got

812
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,798
bugs in a bag of soil

813
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,319
expect the bugs in the back of soil they

814
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,400
should be there that's what happens in

815
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,319
shipping and transport and storage

816
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,000
expect that it's your responsibility as

817
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,200
the gardener to get rid of that

818
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,240
all right i'm gonna take a sip and i'm

819
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,440
gonna talk about one more thing

820
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,440
here we go sips water

821
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,000
the other thing i want to talk about is

822
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,720
rinsing our cocoa when you get bags of

823
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,880
cocoa

824
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,960
that cocoa has been it came from another

825
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,080
country probably malaysia thailand

826
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,640
something like that

827
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,000
that cocoa came on a boat who knows when

828
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,240
they packed up that cocoa

829
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,640
if they use salt water or if it was on a

830
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,440
boat that got a lot of condensation

831
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,919
sometimes the cocoa we get is filled

832
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,159
with

833
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,840
salt so we need to rinse the cocoa

834
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,720
before we use it we've got several ways

835
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,399
of doing that

836
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,400
you can put all of your cocoa into a

837
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
giant container and just hose it down

838
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,400
and just rinse it until you get runoff

839
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,480
or you can put it in the pots that

840
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,480
you're going to plant your plants into

841
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,240
you can mix it with perlite you can put

842
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,839
the perlite and the amendments in there

843
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,359
then you can put it directly into your

844
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,000
pots your threes your fives or your

845
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,639
sevens

846
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,240
whatever you're using then rinse that

847
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,759
while it's in the pot until you get

848
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,599
plenty of runoff

849
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,240
i would almost check to see what the

850
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,839
ppms or ec of that runoff is

851
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,839
get it super low make sure there's not a

852
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,599
lot of salt in there before we put our

853
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,678
plants in there

854
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,119
if you did not rinse your cocoa and you

855
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,000
put your plants in the cocoa and you

856
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,759
were seeing

857
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,440
weird problems with your plants if

858
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,400
they're getting kind of clawy if they're

859
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,320
the leaves are going different

860
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,759
directions you're getting world leaves

861
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,000
or if you're getting odd colors you're

862
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,158
getting

863
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,519
crispiness it's probably because there

864
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,760
was a bunch of salt

865
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,359
in that cocoa and the plants are pissed

866
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,038
off they need to get rinsed out

867
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,479
they just ate all of the salt just

868
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,359
imagine what your mouth tastes like if

869
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,679
you were just

870
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,359
buried in salt so now we've got to

871
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,759
hydrate the plants get the salt out of

872
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,278
there

873
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,480
and start feeding them an appropriate

874
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:18,880
diet that's all it's going to mess with

875
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,120
your

876
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,159
your ph your ec and the overall health

877
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,759
of your plants

878
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,159
so please rinse your cocoa before using

879
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,599
it

880
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,520
some of the higher end brands don't

881
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,879
require as much rinsing but i still do

882
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,918
recommend a quick rinse

883
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,600
whatever brand you choose to use

884
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,440
all right i think that is all i've got

885
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,798
for you for this episode i know it was

886
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,320
