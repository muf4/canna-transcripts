i'm advertising too much and rambling

175
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,120
here at the start of the show

176
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,680
there is a point to this podcast i did

177
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
mention that we do have a serious topic

178
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,800
yes there are a lot of rules changing

179
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,240
they changed some rules here in colorado

180
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,319
before i hit that part

181
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
um i did have a couple of more uh bullet

182
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,759
points there are a lot of new legal

183
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,478
states coming online mike mentioned that

184
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,720
in kind of the

185
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,240
the pre-ramble pre-ramble such a good

186
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
word like a preamble but it's the

187
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,478
pre-ramble i just made that up

188
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,639
in our pre-ramble uh we talked about new

189
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,560
states coming online uh virginia

190
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,879
i think mike said shout out to the goo

191
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,839
to guru if virginia is now legal big up

192
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,719
to guru

193
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,839
um as soon as you said it it didn't

194
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
sound right on my ear so i'm going to

195
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,638
check it again

196
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,399
mike's google and i think you might be

197
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,478
correct it's one of those places but new

198
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,239
mexico is definitely legal now

199
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,519
uh new mexico had some controversy

200
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
because

201
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,000
uh they had a basically i don't remember

202
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,599
the letters of it they have a new mexico

203
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,879
medical marijuana program and

204
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,479
a couple of my friends just got their

205
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,918
medical marijuana cards renewed and they

206
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,279
paid big money to get certain plant

207
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:01,758
counts and do all this stuff and now

208
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,519
they're

209
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,960
allowed to grow so much product legally

210
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,519
because the state of colorado or new

211
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,359
mexico

212
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,120
made these rules today those rules

213
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
changed on the first and now all that

214
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,160
money that my friend paid

215
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
for his card to be valid for the next 18

216
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,639
months is no longer valid and he's

217
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
trying to

218
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,360
find some recourse with the state of new

219
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,478
mexico and new mexico is kind of telling

220
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
him to go [ __ ] himself so that's going

221
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,478
to be interesting but

222
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,439
what i'm getting at in the long rambles

223
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,758
here is

224
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,038
just because your location may have gone

225
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,879
legal

226
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,879
doesn't mean that you can walk out in

227
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,240
the streets with your bong

228
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:37,199
and do bong rips for prosperity so

229
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,800
many rules yeah there are so many rules

230
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,038
and it's your

231
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,879
your responsibility unfortunately to

232
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,839
know them before

233
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,199
you go partake or participate don't

234
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,918
don't be wait to told

235
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,199
be told the rules uh know them before

236
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,399
you break them so

237
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
some of them are not intuitive yeah yeah

238
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,560
but

239
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
just because it's legal where you are

240
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,000
doesn't mean that you can go

241
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,680
taking bong rips in the streets you can

242
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,519
smoke joints in the car

243
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,120
find out the rules and regulations where

244
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,439
you are sometimes

245
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
if uh if the thing was voted on today

246
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,079
and it passed

247
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,680
today people think we can dab in the

248
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,879
streets today number you got to wait for

249
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,879
it to actually go

250
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,560
into place it's gonna take a little time

251
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,839
yeah it's not just like hey we could dab

252
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
now it's like nope no

253
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,598
nope we gotta pat with the rule pass now

254
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,720
we gotta make there's a buffer time that

255
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,959
you gotta wait for

256
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,280
so i love the excitement i love the

257
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,560
enthusiasm i love all of that stuff

258
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,119
but be careful don't think uh don't

259
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,759
uh don't think that just because it's

260
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,079
legal

261
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,800
you can overdo yourself and then end up

262
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,318
in trouble

263
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,160
like when i'm going somewhere else i

264
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,598
went to another state just recently i

265
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,280
went to another place to go visit and

266
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,439
have a good time before i went there

267
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,038
i googled the rules around cannabis

268
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,598
because i knew the people i was going

269
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:49,360
with

270
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,279
what's a there was going to be cannabis

271
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,879
in my group i knew that somehow someway

272
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,318
when i got there there would be cannabis

273
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,240
products involved and i knew we would be

274
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
consuming cannabis i googled

275
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,280
possession laws possession limits what

276
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
happens if i get caught with

277
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,439
concentrates

278
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
what happens if i get caught with

279
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,439
concentrate gear like what if i have a

280
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,919
rig and a torch and a carb cap

281
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,360
and dabs in the car like what are my

282
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,758
opportunities here

283
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,038
you can buy stuff in a store in colorado

284
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,919
that will get you

285
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:20,079
years in prison in nearby st

286
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,680

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,120
for me

335
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,559
in this jar you could see there's uh for

336
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,759
the people just listening

337
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,879
there are remnants like if i were

338
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,399
uh residue if i were a youngster

339
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,240
and i were [ __ ] scrounging up for

340
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,679
concentrates i could get two or three of

341
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,039
these jars and scrape that out of there

342
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,399
i could get a dab i could definitely

343
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,319
make a dab out of that

344
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,000
uh in years past when things weren't the

345
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,440
way they should be i've been known to

346
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,639
[ __ ] pull a couple jars out like i

347
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,760
know there's a dab [ __ ] in all of

348
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,480
these and scrape them together that's

349
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,078
happened

350
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,278
i guess that's the old school this is

351
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,599
the new school version of scraping your

352
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:23,039
[ __ ] pipe let me scrape all my jars

353
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,600
in texas this would be

354
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,559
uh i would be charged with the weight of

355
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,200
this jar

356
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,919
and its lid which this is a glass jar

357
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,480
with a big

358
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,360
dense plastic lid this is at least an

359
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,959
ounce

360
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
i would be charged with an ounce of

361
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,319
concentration because of this container

362
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,159
same legal classification as

363
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
meth and heroin i'm going to drop it on

364
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,639
the table and you can hear how damn

365
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,399
heavy it is

366
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,639
you really need to get the rules people

367
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,159
that's the the tangent we're on is it is

368
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,039
incredibly important to know the rules

369
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,559
where you're playing

370
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,078
yes and in texas they charge you for

371
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,319
your container weight so if you got some

372
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,399
[ __ ] in texas carrying parchment paper

373
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,160
that way it's lighter uh but just don't

374
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,679
[ __ ] around in texas is my legal as your

375
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,600
lawyer i highly advise you don't [ __ ]

376
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,399
around in texas behave yourself

377
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
um all right so know the rules where you

378
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,000
are

379
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,000
it doesn't mean you can dab in the

380
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,039
streets that's that was my point here i

381
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
don't want people getting in trouble

382
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,199
people are like hey i can grow a bunch

383
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,920
of weed now

384
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,278
maybe like be careful the one that

385
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,838
[ __ ] everybody here was

386
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,000
you can't grow weed in your backyard yes

387
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,800
like it feels like you should be able to

388
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,559
but you definitely can't i want to uh

389
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,519
kind of segue we're gonna get to the

390
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,278
topic here but

391
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,120
uh i saw somebody post a picture the

392
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,958

00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,119
outdoor colorado grow

395
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,759
hey guys be careful your limit is six

396
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,519

397
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,200
credentials uh no you don't have

398
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,120
credentials or medical recommendations

399
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,560
two two adults in a house you can

400
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,879
legally grow 12.

401
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,879
yeah so 12. if there's just one adult if

402
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,799
it's a single adult property and only

403
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,679
one person's getting mail there the

404
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,078
the and you don't have a medical card to

405
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,039
limit

406
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,838
six but do not up to 12 with you and a

407
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,958
wife is

00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,039
sami

414
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,360
my friends out there federally like

415
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:18,639
triple think about posting period

416
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,440
because the powers that be still like to

417
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,600
[ __ ] with

418
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,279
us any way they can because it can't yes

419
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,720
yeah depending on your location

420
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,480
definitely a double treatment here in

421
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
colorado it can [ __ ] with your

422
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,519
child custody cases it can [ __ ] with

423
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,839
your job

424
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,919
it can [ __ ] with your livelihood banking

425
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,800
ways your banking

426
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,479
um i mean there's sort of no end to the

427
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,799
list of ways

428
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,680
we have come up with to screw with

429
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,759
people

430
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,000
in an attempt to get them to not smoke

431
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,639
wheat

432
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,679
and during legalization even here in

433
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:56,399
colorado where we really started

434
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:59,439
legalization there's just no

435
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,639
no attempt yet to go back and go we

436
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,880
shouldn't [ __ ] with people's schools

437
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,639
school funding options because they got

438
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,240
caught with pot or

439
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,639
we shouldn't kick them out of federal

440
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,680
housing because they're smoking pot or

441
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,000
you know test positive we shouldn't

442
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,319
take them off transplant lists or

443
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,480
threaten to take their children away

444
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,079
like all those things still happen even

445
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,240
here

446
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,120
yeah so not to be debbie down around the

447
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,560
show but

448
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,639

450

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,199
[ __ ] storefront you can advertise on

455
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,278
the radio but there's nowhere really

456
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,359

457
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,958

um the anti-cannabis powers the bee

500
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:20,719
around the country and here in colorado

501
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,278
have learned that um

502
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,480
the only two talking points they have

503
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,720
that anyone still gives a [ __ ] about are

504
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,959
marijuana is way stronger now than it

505
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,079
was in the 60s and you should be afraid

506
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,278
of that

507
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:38,479
and teenagers getting a hold of cannabis

508
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,078
is especially bad now because it's super

509
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,399
strong like we told you about a minute

510
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:42,559
ago

511
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,480
[Music]

512
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,599
long time listeners of this show will

513
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,759
know that i have

514
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
rambled at length repeatedly about what

515
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,879
nonsense both of those talking points

516
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,839
are

517
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,278
and i'm happy to do so again in a future

518
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,360
show

519
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:01,360
so anyway house bill 1317 with those two

520
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,879
talking points in mind

521
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,079
made its way through the colorado

522
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:09,439
legislature and was signed into law

523
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,719
about a week ago by governor poulos uh

524
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,040
most of the stuff i'm going to be

525
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,879
talking about takes place immediately

526
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,639
or whenever they can figure out how to

527
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,600
do it

528
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,240
because some of it's not immediately

529
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,360
possible in colorado

530
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,959
so under the new law they're changing

531
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:32,240
medical marijuana rules especially for

532
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,559
people under the age of 21. so right now

533
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,799
before this bill in colorado

534
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,638
you can be a medical marijuana patient

535
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:42,479
at any age

536
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:46,079
um if you're 21 or over you just go to

537
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,879
one doctor often a doctor that

538
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,719
specializes in medical marijuana

539
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,198
you talked to that doctor in a doctor's

540
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,600
appointment they fill out your paperwork

541
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,519
you send your paperwork into the state

542
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
you get a thing back on your phone now

543
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,240
it's very easy

544
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,599
um and that's all it takes to get your

545
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,558
medical marijuana card

546
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,838
i believe that's 18 and over yeah 18 and

547
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,639
up i'm sorry

548
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,438
um and there's a different group under

549
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,839
18

550
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,199
where you needed two doctors to sign off

551
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,678
on your card

552
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,240
and most medical marijuana doctors

553
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,959
didn't want

554
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,959
anything to do with you so there was

555
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,600
this middle group of people who were 18

556
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,318
to 21 who were too young to shop in

557
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,918
rec stores but old enough to shop in

558
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,359
medical stores

559
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,640
who would get medical marijuana cards

560
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,519
and the bill supposes a large number of

561
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,799
those people

562
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,400
were then retail selling cannabis they

563
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,119
purchased with their medical card

564
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,840
and cannabis concentrates to their high

565
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,839
school friends

566
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:54,960
and so they've come up with new rules

567
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,558
requiring anyone under 21 to go

568
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,558
see two marijuana doctors

569
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,798
or not two marijuana doctors two doctors

570
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,119
to sign their marijuana paperwork

571
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,279
um they've implemented a couple of other

572
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,479
rules that the physicians will have to

573
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,720
meet

574
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,839
um like reviewing previous doctor's

575
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,960
records

576
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:17,599
um recommending

577
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,519
dosage and potency limits especially for

578
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,678
patients under 21.

579
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,879
uh my video is frozen your video is

580
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,759
frozen you know you

581
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,559
sound perfect you just now froze as long

582
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,440
as you guys

583
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,879
as long as you still getting my

584
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
audiobook i was blowing out my dab you

585
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,440
just came right back dude i was blowing

586
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,918
up my dab and i looked and i was like is

587
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,600
he frozen or am i that high

588
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,360
um that works i needed to take a breath

589
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,558
anyway so

590
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:43,599
you're doing great it's a lot harder for

591
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,558
um under 18 year olds to purchase

592
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,079
cannabis concentrates one of the other

593
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,119
things that freaked them out

594
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,759
was recreational patients can only buy

595
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:57,119
eight grams of concentrates a day

596
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,640
medical patients could buy 40. um i was

597
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,558
surprised to learn that the number is

598
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,160
40. i was pretty sure it was

599
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,678
um like 50 something because 28 plus 28

600
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,960
and that's where the limit comes from

601
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,640
you know i've been at a shop that sells

602
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,960
me 56.

603
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,919
yeah all of the articles that i've read

604
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,279
recently have

605
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:20,080
specified the old limit was 40.

606
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,960
huh i was getting 56 at one spot shout

607
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,038
out to that place

608
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,360
that should have been the limit the way

609
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,679
i understand the way the law is written

610
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,759
it's just literally 15 news articles in

611
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,600
a row said the old limit was 40. i think

612
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,200
the bill language even says the old

613
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,519
limit was 40. wow

614
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,038
but it's pretty clear by one of the

615
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,038
other provisions in this bill that

616
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,160
people that understand colorado's

617
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,960
marijuana laws

618
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,400
and work kind of inside them were not

619
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,558
involved really

620
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,080
this is a bill written by anti-cannabis

621
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,119
people and

622
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:54,720
people they've managed to scare

623
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,558
um so they're requiring under 21 year

624
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,880
olds to go to two doctors

625
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,639
they've made it a really hard to be a

626
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,400
cannabis

627
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,480
uh doctor only um they're trying to push

628
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,280
so that anyone with a medical marijuana

629
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,279
card

630
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,480
is getting that from their primary care

631
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,558
physician

632
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
or if they're under 18 a primary care

633
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,839
physician and

634
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,359
a recommended specialist that already

635
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,480
has access to their whole medical

636
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,599
history

637
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,679
wow there's again this i really need to

638
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,719
stress this listeners this bill is not

639
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,159
meant

640
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:32,000
to do good or to make better or to

641
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:36,000
improve it is meant to hamper hinder

642
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,640
and destroy um explicitly

643
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,640
the people behind this are gleeful on

644
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,480
facebook over the death blow they've

645
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,000
served colorado's medical marijuana

646
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,120
program

647
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,279
this bill started out as a potency cap

648
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,719
at 15

649
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,119
um we'll get to that in a second

650
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,079
so if you're under 21 you've got to go

651
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,678
see two doctors

652
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,599
they made it way harder to be a medical

653
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,200
marijuana doctor in colorado

654
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,798
they're probably going to get incredibly

655
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,080
scarce as well

656
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:08,319
and we're slowly going to start seeing

657
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,079
other physicians who don't specialize in

658
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,678
cannabis being forced

659
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,319
to learn and catch up with the rest of

660
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,640
us

661
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,399
and then fill the gap that's created

662
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,320
when the medical marijuana doctors

663
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,320
start disappearing it changes the

664
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,038
purchase limits for

665
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,439
medical marijuana period down to eight

666
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:34,000
grams of concentrates per day

667
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,000
if you're under 21 so you're um

668
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,960
between 18 and 21 because if your

669
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,480
parents are shopping for you if you're

670
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,200
under 18 and you can't go into the

671
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
building

672
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,480
i believe those people could still get

673
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,000
full 8 grams of concentrates but if

674
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,720
you're between

675
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,359
the ages of 18 and 21 you'll be limited

676
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,360
to just

677
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,959
two per day so if you're an 18 year old

678
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,479
with stomach cancer

679
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,840
who's using concentrates as medicine

680
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,440
your life just got real [ __ ] shitty

681
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,599
um there's no other way to say it you

682
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,798
can't like imagine if you had to fill

683
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,599
your prescription

684
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,240
medicine in a day or two or three or

685
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,759
four days

686
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,759
yeah yeah if you had to go to the

687
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,480
pharmacy six times a month to get your

688
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,798
medicine

689
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,519
and have stomach cancer at the same time

690
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,759
like

691
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,798
it's super unfunctional and that's the

692
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,000
point they want to make it hard and

693
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:27,918
unfunctional um

694
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,400
so those are the main changes to medical

695
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,840
marijuana they also want to

696
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,440
one of the big ones that i almost just

697
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,240
forgot bad mike

698
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,960
um they're gonna set up a statewide

699
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,759
medical marijuana tracking

700
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,200
they want system yeah a function to our

701
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,960
tracking system metric

702
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,558
that tracks cannabis product from

703
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,798
a seed stage or clone stage through

704
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,558
moving out into the consumer world so

705
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,879
like you they track it to the dispensary

706
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,038
and then as the dispensary sells it

707
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,240
there's just a form that says they sold

708
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,759
that pound of weed

709
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,400
you know three and a half grams at a

710
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,640
time all day long until it was gone

711
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,440
they want it set up so that it marks

712
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,759
that

713
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,919
jeff bought three grams on monday and

714
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,919
three more grams on wednesday and i came

715
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,000
in on tuesday and bought four grams and

716
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,559
then seven grams on sunday

717
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,440
they want it all specific to the patient

718
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,558
so that

719
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,960
the state registry will kick out an

720
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,599
error at a retail level if an 18 to 21

721
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
year old

722
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:34,480
tries to store hop and buy more than

723
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,639
2 grams per day

724
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,038
they also want it set up so that the

725
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,540
doctor's recommendation of

726
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,960
you should have um

727
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:45,839
[Music]

728
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,679
x amount of cannabis per dose x amount

729
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,240
of doses per day

730
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,240
so like when you your other stuff it's

731
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
in milligrams so 50 milligrams in the

732
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,159
morning

733
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,599
by mouth with food or whatever or three

734
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,400
times a day with

735
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,798
just water they want the same thing with

736
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,798
marijuana or cannabis medicine

737
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,960
and they also want a potency attachment

738
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,720
too because one of the theories they've

739
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,240
built into the bill is that the higher

740
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,759
the potency number

741
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:17,519
the more problematic it becomes um

742
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,278
consumption consequence wise they're

743
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,119
the people behind this bill have an

744
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,519
operating theory

745
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,519
that cannabis concentrates cause

746
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,639
schizophrenia

747
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,400
so like these aren't sane people a lot

748
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,080
of them are

749
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,640
very tragic figures um i can get into

750
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,918
that too

751
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,679
but i kind of want to stay focused on

752
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,400
the bill before i get too slowly off

753
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,278
yeah and 280d off into the corner

754
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,120
um so that's the medical marijuana stuff

755
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,480
um the tracking program

756
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:52,399
super unfeasible right now

757
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,159
the last time i worked with metricmetric

758
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,759
was not capable of doing that it was

759
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,840
barely capable of doing what we're

760
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,038
asking it to do

761
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:03,038
asking it to track retail enough so

762
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,879
that the state database knows how many

763
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,480
grams of medical marijuana everybody

764
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,360
bought last week is going to be really

765
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,200
complicated

766
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,879
there's another state that actually does

767
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
that they used to they don't anymore

768
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,440
they just

769
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,519
changed that system to the fro i think

770
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,278
so uh but they used to go by units and

771
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,720
you were allowed so many units per month

772
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:19,679
and the state would know how many units

773
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,319
you have and it would be in your

774
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,000
computer

775
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,678
and as you shop just like you would say

776
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,038
mike's got 100 units and you'd buy

777
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,320
whatever and then it would take it out

778
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,240
of your units

779
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,759
yeah like a concentrate would be two

780
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,880
units and a flower a gram would be a

781
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,038
unit or whatever

782
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,600
i don't know how they broke it down but

783
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:38,158
um the folks behind this bill

784
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,918
really hoped this would kill medical and

785
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,840
i think that's a big reason

786
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,000
they don't have any sort of tracking

787
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:47,038
system for reg

788
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,839
or for recreational it's just it's just

789
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,558
specifically targeted on the med program

790
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,158
um they're making it harder on doctors

791
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,240
they're making it harder on dispensaries

792
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,080
they're making it harder on med grows

793
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,880
the whole point is to squeeze the

794
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:03,038
medical industry until it just shutters

795
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,039
and colorado just has a recreational

796
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,759
industry because

797
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,200
people needing cannabis medicine is

798
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,240
bulletproof

799
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,519
politically it's got support

800
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,319
in the 70s and 80s yeah the

801
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,440
anyone who spent any time working in or

802
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:24,720
around

803
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:28,400
marijuana knows its healing potential um

804
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,319
sanjay gupta is an incredible example of

805
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,400
staunch prohibitionist who worked

806
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,759
against us spending time

807
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,840
near us and having his eyes opened

808
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,278
wide to the point where he was a major

809
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,599
advocate for

810
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,880
years with those camp weed specials on

811
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,079
cnn

812
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,278
if you don't know what i'm talking about

813
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,798
please google sanjay gupta weed specials

814
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,558
is four or five hours of wonderful

815
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,839
television

816
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,720
if you're unfamiliar with medical

817
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:58,158
marijuana those will get you all cut up

818
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,278
um so some other parts of this bill

819
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,919
uh limiting medical purchasing down from

820
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,038
from 40 grams a day to eight is pretty

821
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,080
brutal

822
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:12,720
for a lot of med patients

823
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:16,639
um it also sets money aside to study

824
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,960
um cannabis potency because

825
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,559
you can't just give people concentrates

826
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,640
and see what happens to them

827
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,879
that'd be wildly unethical according to

828
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,919
modern psychology and modern medical

829
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,320
studies

830
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:34,000
and the dea and nida won't allow it

831
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:37,038
so the odds that this money

832
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,558
is used for actual research is zero or

833
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,599
maybe one percent

834
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,519
so they'll probably pull articles

835
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,199
and just compile their findings from

836
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,319
other articles where they tried to look

837
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,798
at this

838
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,720
nobody's really done the research um

839
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,398
which is funny because the original

840
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,798
marijuana research where they discovered

841
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,000
the thc and cbd molecule was done with

842
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,918
ashish

843
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,519
and the researcher has a lovely story

844
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,080
about going to the police station and

845
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,918
picking up confiscated kilos and then

846
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,960
riding on a public bus back to the lab

847
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,960
with them

848
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,480
so hashish and concentrates have been

849
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,919
part of marijuana research

850
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,839
since the first day we started

851
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,880
researching it mike what if we try to

852
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,839
transport some

853
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,799
uh medical concentrates on the bus now

854
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,720
like hey

855
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,798
mike i'm just going to laugh really hard

856
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,159
putting it on the contractions portion

857
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,319
of a manifest

858
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,320
that'd be so funny walk the bus stop bus

859
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:29,759
one one seven

860
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,960
ride to stop 74. you guys that work

861
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,038
metric i want to know if this works for

862
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,360
you i saw somebody uh in the directions

863
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,599
it said planned route it said uh

864
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,038
quickest possible route or most logical

865
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,398
route or something like that

866
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,119
and they just typed that as their whole

867
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,798
travel guide so that was my go-to for

868
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,199
like the last year i did manifest

869
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,240
really did it work for you i never had

870
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,319
anybody complain

871
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,240
no you're not in jail so that works my

872
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,038
favorite thing i submitted my med badge

873
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,679
and there's the thing that when you

874
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:54,798
submit it

875
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,480
it says hey just because you're

876
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,000
submitting your badge doesn't mean

877
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,440
you're relinquished of any crimes you

878
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,038
may have committed while you had this

879
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,278
badge yeah it doesn't that [ __ ] is

880
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,960
so funny yeah this isn't like you didn't

881
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,679
just hit safe by [ __ ] tapping out of

882
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,440
the game

883
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,038
you could still be [ __ ] that was that

884
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,480
was a great clause they made sure i

885
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,879
signed that little stipulation i was

886
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,720
like yeah

887
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,640
i just need this because other stuff not

888
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,839
worried um

889
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,080
all right mike so they're going to limit

890
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,119
our concentrate uh purchases

891
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,319
i want to ask do you think uh that this

892
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,398
is just going to send

893
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,240
people to the black market the free

894
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,959
market sorry the what is it

895
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,679
there are so many words um i still say

896
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,200
black

897
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,038
black market i get that the cannabis

898
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,360
market is such a weird space and the

899
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,759
history of it is super interesting

900
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,719
and so it's very different than other

901
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:42,720
illicit markets

902
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,879
in the late 90s and the time when we

903
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:52,240
were really involved it was

904
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,559
small home grows and friends and

905
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,480
associates and that's a reason that

906
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,960
there weren't a lot of bodies

907
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,399
you know like we just stopped being

908
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,798
friends when

909
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,319
somebody [ __ ] up or we just didn't

910
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:05,440
like that guy or maybe somebody got beat

911
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,278
up you know

912
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,038
like there weren't major shootouts over

913
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:13,759
turf and [ __ ]

914
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:17,038
um but uh

915
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:19,440
it never fully went away it just stopped

916
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,119
having a point here in colorado like

917
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,080
it's just so easy to hit the dispensary

918
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,199
i don't have to call anybody

919
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:27,278
i don't have to arrange anything um the

920
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,038
odds that

921
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:32,398
what we grew up in has a major

922
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,359
resurgency or resurgence here is pretty

923
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,558
slim

924
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:39,278
i think what's likely to happen is it's

925
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,798
going to squeeze medical to death

926
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,319
and so there's going to be a slow

927
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,319
turnover of

928
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,798
all of the places that have med and

929
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,759
wreck are slowly going to convert their

930
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,879
med to

931
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,679
more wreck and the places that just have

932
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,760
med

933
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,200
are gonna be desperate as [ __ ] to

934
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:59,038
convert to wreck

935
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,399
because med still i'm

936
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:06,000
99 sure requires patient

937
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:09,759
sign ups for plant counts

938
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,200
um my medical program function knowledge

939
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,839
is a little rusty because

940
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,880
i'm not even a med card holder for the

941
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,119
first time in like

942
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,480
15 years right now because i've been so

943
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,518
damn busy [ __ ] i haven't even been on

944
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,720
the show

945
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,240
right um so i've even let my med card

946
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,159
lapse but i'm 99

947
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,000
sure medical dispensaries here still

948
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,039
need patience to sign up with them

949
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,480
so that they can have a plant limit

950
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:38,879
and grow it in their grow and when med

951
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,880
medical marijuana doctors vanish

952
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,240
they're going to be way hard up for

953
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,558
patients

954
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,000
starting in a few months because patient

955
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,599
numbers drop off every month

956
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,519
you know so like this bill was designed

957
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,639
to kill medical and it's probably gonna

958
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,640
do it

959
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,480
it's frustrating i was really surprised

960
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,038
with how little the industry pushed back

961
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,079
on this

962
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:03,440
as soon as they got the potency cap

963
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:06,079
pushed to a potency study they sat out

964
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,320
the rest of the fight which sucks

965
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,918
i didn't hear too much about it stuff i

966
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,278
hear a lot about a lot of these things

967
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,399
and this one was kind of quiet

968
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,798
i feel like this one's coming out the

969
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,798
time

970
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,720
um the couple of times i brought it up

971
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,319
because there was a packaging

972
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,278
requirement that was tied to this where

973
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,398
they were gonna have

974
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,880
yeah all cannabis concentrates had to be

975
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,479
sold

976
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,159
in one tenth of a gram containers

977
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,798
which would mean you could still go buy

978
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,679
your 8 grams but instead of 8 jars you

979
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,639
would have to buy

980
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,798
80 jars or they would have to figure out

981
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,440
a way to divvy up

982
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:44,319
well it's inside the jar into 10 set

983
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,759
easily identifiable segments

984
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,960
um that got cut out thank god through an

985
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,079
amendment

986
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,159
um but instead they inserted like three

987
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,599
million dollars in funding

988
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,640
for uh an educational campaign to talk

989
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:03,678
to youth about extracted thc

990
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,960
um another million a year to keep that

991
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,320
program going through 2024

992
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,960
um another two million dollars for

993
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:15,439
one of the local universities to

994
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,440
research

995
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,839
cannabis potency and the effects of

996
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:25,038
potent cannabis products on humans

997
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:27,918
another 1.7 million dollars to create a

998
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:31,440
reporting system for coroners

999
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:35,679
to report all

1000
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,120
um violent deaths so anything but died

1001
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,640
of old age they want

1002
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:43,199
a tox screen run and those results

1003
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,120
reported to a statewide database

1004
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,798
because the people behind this bill are

1005
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,959
a hundred percent sure

1006
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,119
that if you smoke cannabis you commit

1007
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,000
suicide later

1008
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,518
especially if you're dabbing um they

1009
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,119
write books about it they go to

1010
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,839
conferences where they tell each other

1011
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,119
about it

1012
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:03,038
i mean it's i smoked a gram

1013
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,038
of concentrates while we've been sitting

1014
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,480
here on zoom we've been on zoom for much

1015
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,559
longer than we've been recording this

1016
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,079
podcast i've consumed a gram

1017
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,838
this jar is empty i showed the jar i

1018
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,359
kind of want to go something i've never

1019
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:13,599
done on a podcast on my show i've done

1020
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:15,918
it

1021
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,240
as a guest i want to get up and go to my

1022
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,358
concentrate location and acquire another

1023
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,279
jar

1024
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,559
and uh i have no desire to hurt myself

1025
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,879
or other people bro

1026
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,039
it's [ __ ] shenanigans it's [ __ ]

1027
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:32,319
is what that is it's [ __ ] stupid

1028
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:37,358
so between the ages of

1029
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:40,559
12 and 30. all of the crazy happens

1030
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,838
and like that's when you leave the house

1031
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,519
for the first time

1032
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,519
that's when you discover who you are as

1033
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,800
a person that's where you go on

1034
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,599
[ __ ] i can't believe we lived through

1035
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,159
that kind of [ __ ] bro type adventures

1036
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,200
um that's the and then the vans started

1037
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,039
rolling type

1038
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:58,159
that's the age group yeah yeah and if

1039
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:02,000
you look at all of the metrics

1040
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:04,879
like that age group dies young

1041
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,719
the most like in that window it's not 40

1042
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,200
year olds it's not 10 year olds it's

1043
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:12,799
like 16 to 30.

1044
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:14,159
um that's also when mental illness

1045
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,720
appears

1046
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:21,920
that's also when um

1047
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:24,799
other disorders like anxiety bipolar

1048
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,639
opposition defiant those can really come

1049
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,000
to a head in the late teens early

1050
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,960
twenties

1051
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,679
and the other thing that happens then is

1052
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,599
you start

1053
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:38,399
experimenting with narcotics and and

1054
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,800
alcohol tobacco pot those are the big

1055
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,119
three

1056
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,839
sex drugs and rock and roll man yep it's

1057
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,000
just not the same if you don't do all

1058
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:46,320
three

1059
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,320
um

1060
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,800
but gotta go fast for a large part the

1061
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,000
people behind this bill

1062
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,400
and the people that make up the

1063
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,559
anti-cannabis movement are people who

1064
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:03,200
had loved ones who died young

1065
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:06,320
and were using cannabis to some extent

1066
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:09,759
before they died some of these people

1067
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,559
were clearly experiencing mental illness

1068
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,560
one of the things that you learn when

1069
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,440
you study depression and mental illness

1070
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,519
and psychology

1071
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,559
is that when people are in a state of

1072
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,159
mental anguish

1073
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:25,358
or anxiety depression

1074
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,239
you self-medicate with anything you need

1075
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:28,880
your hands on

1076
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,959
yeah and anyone who's known someone with

1077
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,039
mental illness or depression

1078
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,240
especially when that was emerging in

1079
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,519
them

1080
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,078
they self-medicate wildly because you

1081
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,320
think

1082
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,640
i'm not depressed i'm tired so you drink

1083
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,640
a lot of you start abusing caffeine

1084
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,039
the caffeine starts taking its toll so

1085
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,639
you start smoking pot or drinking at

1086
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,079
night to take the edge off so you can

1087
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,199
unwind

1088
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,240
and that tends to make mental illness

1089
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:59,439
worse and so there's

1090
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:02,399
definitely a cycle that can start when

1091
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,838
a young person starts suffering and

1092
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,800
starts

1093
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:06,639
self-medicating and then eventually

1094
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,960
commits suicide

1095
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:11,279
and if you look at it objectively from

1096
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,000
the outside you can see that

1097
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,480
oh it's not an a leads to b leads to c

1098
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,159
thing

1099
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,159
it's it was all depression and

1100
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,199
all of the steps you're seeing aren't

1101
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,159
steps

1102
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,000
they're not dominoes they're symptoms

1103
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,199
that all come from the middle thing

1104
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,199
yeah and when you're up close

1105
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:35,679
all you see is the loss and

1106
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,480
when we were kids these people would

1107
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,799
yeah

1108
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,760
you seek to place blame and when we were

1109
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,800
kids these people

1110
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,320
ended up to some extent going from

1111
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,480
middle school to middle school to tell

1112
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,119
you not to smoke crack

1113
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,880
um or whatever it was of the day don't

1114
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,000
don't drink my kid died in a drunk

1115
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,480
driving accident

1116
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,760
don't do coke my kid died coked out in a

1117
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,159
car accident

1118
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,440
don't do heroin my my favorite son who

1119
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,319
was a wrestler and a star

1120
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,639
athlete died of heroin like now they

1121
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,240
have

1122
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:09,039
online anti-pop groups that they can get

1123
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,039
whatever from

1124
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,679
these groups have been throwing

1125
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,920
everything they can

1126
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,679
at the wall trying to see what sticks

1127
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,599
and the only two things that get any

1128
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,519
traction with anybody anymore

1129
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,359
are the potency argument and the think

1130
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,400
about the kids argument

1131
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,400
save the children and

1132
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,240
i mean i was really disgusted to see

1133
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,320
that this gained traction

1134
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,159
i was horrified when it got all the

1135
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,000
sponsors i got

1136
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,358
i was horrified with how quickly it

1137
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,960
moved through

1138
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:44,799
the colorado house and senate um

1139
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,358
jared polis is incredibly pro-cannabis

1140
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,280
had a big signing event where the people

1141
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,199
behind this bill went to the governor's

1142
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,040
mansion and hung out around him

1143
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:54,960
at the signing table while he signed it

1144
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,559
and then got to take home the ceremonial

1145
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,838
pens and [ __ ]

1146
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,838
and some of that's just the pomp and

1147
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,639
circumstance that goes with

1148
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,119
bill signing ceremonial depends that's

1149
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,159
just

1150
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,559
like a lot of times they just

1151
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,519
five of them get signed and you read

1152
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,679
about it in the news

1153
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,519
the next day these five bills got signed

1154
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,118
into law here's what they do

1155
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,759
there's no ceremony there's no

1156
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,119
ceremonial pens there's just

1157
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,280
the process being fulfilled legally

1158
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,200
and so the fact that there was a signing

1159
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,440
ceremony in ceremonial pens was

1160
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,919
disturbing in its own right because

1161
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,800
that pop and circumstance isn't

1162
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,760
necessarily

1163
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,119
standard even though it is common and to

1164
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,320
see a pro-cannabis

1165
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,039
governor sign an anti-cannabis

1166
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,039
bill that's only thinly veiled as a

1167
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,880
regulation build was pretty ugly did we

1168
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:47,759
just lose video again i saw you glitch

1169
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,599
and then wave

1170
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,880
you're bad good audio yep audio is

1171
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,599
beautiful so you're back

1172
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,119
yeah the audio stays good yeah i'm

1173
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,880
recording on a backup source as well so

1174
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,880
i'm thinking trying to do this right

1175
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,559
um yeah i always thought that dude was

1176
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,079
on our team and then when i read what he

1177
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,358
had done i was like wait what but

1178
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,960
yeah he did a couple other things that

1179
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:06,159
confused me too so i'm not i don't even

1180
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,880
want to talk too much about politics

1181
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:09,679
like

1182
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,000
i don't know enough but i feel like i

1183
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,039
learned

1184
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,358
certain people because they they

1185
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,199
represent us okay i'm scrolling through

1186
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,559
the article on the westward here just to

1187
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,399
make sure i'm hitting all the points i

1188
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,159
need to and the the paragraph right here

1189
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,838
is the recreational marijuana industry

1190
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,118
has stayed largely neutral or silent on

1191
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,318
the bill

1192
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,720
um the medical marijuana community which

1193
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:28,239
means

1194
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,078
actual community members or they would

1195
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:33,279
have said industry um

1196
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,280
voiced the loudest resistance um over a

1197
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,560
hundred medical marijuana doctors

1198
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,040
sent an opposition letter to the

1199
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:42,639
governor asking him to veto

1200
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,759
um i don't think the governor's veto

1201
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,279
would have done anything

1202
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,880
because it looks like they really did

1203
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,160
have the votes to force it through

1204
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,039
regardless

1205
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,679
that's rough um

1206
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:54,960
[Music]

1207
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:57,679
this sets up a couple of studies that

1208
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,440
because of the limitations in this

1209
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,919
policy and law

1210
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,559
the the study can only conclude that

1211
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,960
concentrates are scary

1212
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,639
and we don't know enough and i think

1213
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,318
that's going to be enough for them to

1214
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,118
try to push concentrates out of the

1215
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,838
wreck market

1216
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,838
in two years

1217
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,280
yeah the people behind these bills their

1218
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,800
goal is to [ __ ]

1219
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,760
and to destroy and they know that they

1220
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,359
can't

1221
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,440
like if they just ran a straight up

1222
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,719
let's repeal amendment 64 and go back to

1223
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,240
prohibition

1224
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,799
that they would get laughed out of the

1225
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,399
[ __ ] state like maybe not even left

1226
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,960
maybe rudd not on a rail

1227
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:42,160
like um but

1228
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,159
they found ways where they can get in

1229
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,679
on the side conversation and they can

1230
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,679
bleed us dry

1231
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,039
and one of them was let's keep adding

1232
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,358
taxes yeah

1233
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,400
until there was no money left to pay the

1234
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,960
people

1235
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,920
and they got real close to doing it that

1236
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,760
way

1237
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,519
and got stuck yeah there's so many taxes

1238
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,040
yep they came up with the let's do the

1239
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,358
potency bill

1240
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,480
and two or three years ago we were able

1241
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,239
to just we hired

1242
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,599
all of the petition circulating

1243
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,358
companies

1244
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,800
and we made sure they were otherwise

1245
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:16,400
occupied and the

1246
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,839
the anti-pop people were just straight

1247
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,599
up about the fact that they didn't have

1248
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:21,358
a broad enough coalition to support to

1249
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,079
get the signatures anyway without a

1250
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,078
hired company

1251
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:30,318
and then this year they

1252
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,760
found a way to get the legislators to

1253
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:32,800
push it forward through them so they

1254
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,359
didn't need

1255
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,680
any signatures yeah they got a couple of

1256
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,679
sponsors to take their

1257
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,039
their language and tweak it a little bit

1258
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,799
and throw it forward

1259
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,480
and the original bill would have killed

1260
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,560
the concentrate industry completely

1261
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,400
yeah completely yeah things you were

1262
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,078
telling me about the industry down for

1263
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,599
a couple of years some of the things you

1264
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,200
said the past few months had me worried

1265
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,559
i was like clutching my dab rig going

1266
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,078
hey wait but i mean what are they gonna

1267
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,719
do with my dabs

1268
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,359
yep and it's we're in one of those weird

1269
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,719
fluxes

1270
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,920
i mean historically society makes a

1271
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,480
bunch of progress

1272
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,838
and things get newer and better and more

1273
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,199
interesting

1274
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,279
and then a period of conflict happens

1275
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,879
like an 18-month pandemic to shut

1276
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,800
everything down

1277
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,318
and then things go conservative for a

1278
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,119
while

1279
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:23,679
sometimes it's a minute sometimes it's

1280
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,680
10 years

1281
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,199
and it usually the pendulum swings the

1282
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,559
other way for a bit

1283
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:33,679
um you can go back and pull some like

1284
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:36,639
[ __ ] level lyrics from the 1930s

1285
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:38,078
because the 20s and 30s had a big sexual

1286
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,239
revolution

1287
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,680
that was so far repressed they had to

1288
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:46,078
[ __ ] reinvent that [ __ ] in the 60s

1289
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,799
um mike's over here making wap

1290
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,160
references

1291
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,000
a couple months late but i'm still

1292
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,598
impressed life's different

1293
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,039
um it's just

1294
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,720
this feels like something we're gonna

1295
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,920
backslide on and i

1296
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:02,799
really need the community to give a [ __ ]

1297
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,519
about us because it's not a good thing

1298
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,318
um

1299
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,000
the powers that be are pissed that they

1300
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,159
can't take away our voting rights

1301
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,760
because we like cannabis they're pissed

1302
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,440
that they can't take away our property

1303
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,000
because we like cannabis

1304
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,119
they're really pissed that we've made an

1305
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,920
industry

1306
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,800
out of buying selling growing and

1307
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,760
consuming cannabis and if they can find

1308
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,680
a way

1309
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,760
to put the genie back in the bottle and

1310
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,440
go back to kicking doors in because you

1311
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,640
might have a quarter ounce of weed in

1312
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,920
the table

1313
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:36,000
they're gonna and we can't let them

1314
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,559
and this is them trying the best they

1315
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,639
know how right now to backslide

1316
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,159
if you get online and look for like

1317
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:44,879
project sam

1318
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:47,039
or smart approaches to marijuana talking

1319
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,240
about this bill in colorado

1320
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:53,279
their language is explicit colorado's

1321
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:56,318
experiment with legalization has failed

1322
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,560
full stop proof of that is this

1323
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,759
regulation bill where we're finally

1324
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,400
going to hold

1325
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,880
those evil marijuana people accountable

1326
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,160
and we

1327
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,680
finally fought and hard-won regulations

1328
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:09,358
and they act like we don't have any

1329
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,960
rules

1330
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,639
they act like it's people growing in

1331
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,760
their basements and selling it on street

1332
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,799
corners to toddlers

1333
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,680
it's insane and they get away with it

1334
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,160
because

1335
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,199
people like me have two kids now and we

1336
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,759
don't make it to all the meetings

1337
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,439
anymore

1338
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,319
right and i'm over here running a

1339
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,559
podcast and not doing my job i guess

1340
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:29,920
so mike how do we to start wrapping up

1341
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,000
because we've been going for uh long

1342
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,599
enough uh how do we

1343
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,519
make sure that [ __ ] doesn't happen like

1344
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,280
this uh to us in the future here in

1345
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:38,880
colorado but in places where they are

1346
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,160
working on legalization and building

1347
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,920
their foundation

1348
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,279
uh how did we miss this and how do we

1349
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,559
make sure stuff like this doesn't keep

1350
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,839
happening and what can we do i want to

1351
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,400
get some final moments from

1352
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,480
some some mike's minutes if you will i

1353
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,559
think this happened because the industry

1354
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,119
grew complacent

1355
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,480
um part of our legal industry is chase

1356
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,920
people like me out because we're

1357
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,559
annoying

1358
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,800
um we remind the boss that federal law

1359
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,039
says brakes are a [ __ ] thing

1360
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,240
we we call the boss when it's 105

1361
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,000
degrees in the building in our property

1362
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,279
oh you tell me hey buddy you're driving

1363
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,199
too fast with all the

1364
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,800
dab rig and you're in the cup holder

1365
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,318
you're that guy that's why that's why we

1366
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,079
call him white mike you guys that's his

1367
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:19,920
[ __ ] job

1368
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,039
i like the boss don't like it when you

1369
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,200
tell him you won't

1370
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,279
skirt the law for the same amount of

1371
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:26,639
money they just don't like it

1372
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,599
they don't like it when you call them on

1373
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:32,239
the [ __ ] and that's what advocates

1374
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,838
do is we see something that's wrong and

1375
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,118
it pisses us off and we stand up and

1376
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,599
speak about it

1377
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,519
and it's it takes a lot of work it takes

1378
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,240
a lot of dedication it takes an endless

1379
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,838
amount of study and reading um

1380
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,358
i mean just knowing this bill was a

1381
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:48,078
thing you have to at least

1382
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,119
check the news regularly or you wouldn't

1383
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,839
even heard about it

1384
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,160
yeah i wouldn't have known without you

1385
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:55,358
it

1386
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,679
uh when i asked when

1387
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,838
the packaging requirement for hash still

1388
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,679
said concentrates had to be served in

1389
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,358
tenth of a gram containers

1390
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:05,919
when that was still direct language in

1391
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:07,279
the bill i asked around every time i was

1392
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,200
in a shop

1393
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,640
y'all hear about the the regulation bill

1394
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,639
to come no what do you mean

1395
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,159
oh it's it's really [ __ ] up you should

1396
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,118
learn about it one of the things is

1397
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,039
they're gonna

1398
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,838
require packaging oh they wouldn't do

1399
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:22,318
that that doesn't make any sense

1400
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,279
that would hurt us they wouldn't do that

1401
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,000
that was the take

1402
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,720
everywhere and getting people to

1403
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,400
understand

1404
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:32,799
that the world don't like us

1405
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,760
matter of fact most of them grew up

1406
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,359
sitting in circle

1407
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,920
talking about how much they ought to

1408
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,358
hate us to shun us to chase us out of

1409
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,119
the room

1410
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:46,480
like there's still companies that are

1411
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,480
big mad that we all smoke weed now and

1412
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,400
if they want us to pass a drug test

1413
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,358
they're gonna have to pay us a lot

1414
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,480
because we'll take a look more shitty

1415
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,838
job because we get to smoke weed there

1416
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,760
not at the job but i mean you were

1417
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,480
allowed afterwards afterwards yeah like

1418
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,640
yeah

1419
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,079
tell you what to do at home as soon as

1420
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:05,598
the boss starts talking to you about

1421
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,800
what to do in your off hours it's time

1422
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,039
to find a new boss

1423
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,839
yep that's the truth or create a job of

1424
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:11,279
your own

1425
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:12,880
and they don't like that they've lost

1426
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,119
that bit of control

1427
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,240
and a lot of industries have their hands

1428
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,599
tied because

1429
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:20,799
in the full prohibition days we used to

1430
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,280
pay people

1431
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,359
to think up ways to try to convince me

1432
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,519
and jeff not to smoke weed

1433
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:29,358
and so they were like you can't ever

1434
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:31,920
hold a license

1435
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:32,880
operating heavy equipment or driving a

1436
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,559
truck

1437
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:40,160
or um using a forklift

1438
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,119
or working in like the meatpacking

1439
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:42,879
industry

1440
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,559
like they get all those [ __ ] people

1441
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,559
have to get drug tested constantly

1442
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:49,920
the fast food employees and they they

1443
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,519
got

1444
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,440
insurance companies to give the

1445
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,358
companies big discounts if they would

1446
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,159
just drug test their employees

1447
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,598
and so one by one all of these

1448
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,598
industries got a little thumb

1449
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,720
on their necks saying we've got a drug

1450
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,838
test yep

1451
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:07,279
and places like colorado the company's

1452
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:10,078
forced to choose between

1453
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,599
eating that insurance discount or drug

1454
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,680
testing their people and not having a

1455
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,680
workforce

1456
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,440
like it's just people got to stay

1457
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,679
vigilant and stay on top of this stuff

1458
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,720
and we really need to start electing

1459
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:25,039
better people

1460
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:25,679
holy [ __ ] um predictably the sponsors of

1461
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:27,440
this bill

1462
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,279
one of the main sponsors is a

1463
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,119
pediatrician

1464
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:36,480
a pediatrician and she's talking about

1465
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,519
18 year olds cannabis habits she's a

1466
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,599
pediatrician

1467
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,199
yeah what do you think her take on this

1468
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,480
is do you think her patients are honest

1469
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,480
with her

1470
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,318
do you think 18 year olds are honest

1471
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,760
with their dog that [ __ ] wasn't

1472
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:49,119
right doctors like you smell like

1473
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,160
cigarettes and i can see them on the

1474
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,519
floor over there where they fell out of

1475
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,440
your pants you sure you don't smoke yeah

1476
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:56,480
i don't smoke dog

1477
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,960
like i certainly don't smoke weed doc

1478
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,599
yep you'll tell my mom i can't have her

1479
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,280
now

1480
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,039
yeah like it's just ridiculous and then

1481
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,960
they fear-monger this [ __ ] in and it's

1482
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,480
really gonna [ __ ] with the industry

1483
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,199
the that potency study it's set up in

1484
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,159
this bill

1485
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,279
so that a commission is formed to do the

1486
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,838
study

1487
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,720
and then whatever recommendations they

1488
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:23,119
make

1489
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:24,879
the med and

1490
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,440
the department of revenue have to figure

1491
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,519
out how to make them a rule

1492
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,318
and so if they come back saying our

1493
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:35,280
research shows that anything above 15

1494
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:36,800
thc is considered a hard drug which if

1495
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,680
they just google

1496
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,800
where does the netherlands not to stop

1497
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:45,679
caring about cannabis

1498
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:49,039
it's i think it's 15 thc oh wow and

1499
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,719
all of a sudden we've got that rule here

1500
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:54,318
where anything above 15

1501
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:56,639
is a no go like it's that could happen

1502
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,480
in other states i think uh

1503
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,318
there's one state on the east coast that

1504
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,039
has a potency cap already i think it's

1505
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:04,079
60

1506
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,358

1507
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,318
you so what if you make a concentrate

1508
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:07,519

1509
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:09,599

00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,759
saying how much dedication reading time

1524

and energy it takes to be an advocate

1525

thank you bro because without you laying

1526
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,519

00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,959
to do

1528
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:40,639
i wouldn't be able to put the [ __ ]

1529
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,199
seeds in it that's the greatest way i

1530
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,318
could put it

1531
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,519
so thank you bro we need you out there

1532

00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,719
doing it so

1534
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:48,239
you guys if you are curious on how to be

1535
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:49,199
active how to get involved in the

1536
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:50,719
political side

1537
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:52,159
uh not everybody's a grower not

1538
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:53,598
everybody's a podcaster if you want to

1539
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,078
do some behind the scenes work and get

1540
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,760
legalization going where you are

1541
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,280
get it going contact mike he will help

1542
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,800
you out teach you how to do all that

1543
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,119
stuff give you some tips and tricks

1544
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,800
he's a busy dude but he will respond to

1545
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,760
you i do promise that

1546
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,119
and you can totally stay anonymous doing

1547
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,680
this also

1548
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:16,880
it's harder but in none of my advocacy

1549
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:20,159
has anyone ever checked my id

1550
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,800
so you could fully be any sort of pen

1551
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,920
name you want as long as it's believable

1552
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:28,160
and letters to the editor have

1553
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,480
a lot of weight to them the powers that

1554
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,318
be still really like newspapers

1555
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,318
and they don't have an ability to check

1556
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,558
who's at the end of the email either

1557
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,440
so you just submit an email go to

1558
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,359
outlook

1559
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,440
you can create a new outlook email in

1560
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,880
about four seconds

1561
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,039
and you can be anybody you want to be

1562
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,240
just the more people speaking out the

1563
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,358
better it is for everybody

1564
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,879
mike is feeding the trolls yeah yeah the

1565
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:53,598
more people the better that's definitely

1566
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,559
it we need more

1567
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,079
so there are a lot of people that are

1568
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,440
sitting around smoking listening to the

1569
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,359
show loving the show

1570
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,639
