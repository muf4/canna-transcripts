54
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,300
talk about my garden update occasionally

55
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,909
I like to update you folks on what is

56
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,849
happening in my garden if you've been

57
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:35,469
following along you know that I recently

58
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:38,469
pollinated several females with a

59
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:40,659
reversed blueberry cookies pollen donor

60
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:42,219
that was a blueberry cookies female

61
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,199
plant that was treated with a solution

62
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:46,239
that encouraged that plant to create

63
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,548
pollen which only contains female

64
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,280
chromosomes that pollen will be put on

65
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:54,700
several selected females and that will

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,340
make several lines of feminized seeds in

67
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,409
that room of females being pollinated by

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,689
the reversed blueberry cookies is of

69
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,400
course another blueberry cookies female

70
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:05,348
that will receive pollen there's a

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,930
platinum tangi there is a Strawberry

72
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:10,479
Fields there's a lemon skunk there's

73
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,489
also a female of my favorite arise and

74
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,310
also there is a Durbin poison in that

75
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,019
room there also may be a couple of other

76
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,060
females in there that have not been

77
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,489
pollinated by this reversed blueberry

78
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,469
cookies before so when those seeds are

79
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,480
done I will test them I'll get some out

80
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,068
to my other tester friends will see if

81
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,348
they are up to par if they meet my

82
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:31,238
standards and if so we will add those to

83
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:32,709
the lineup the next time I reverse the

84
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,079
blueberry cookies I will make more of

85
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,329
those and we will release those with the

86
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,069
rest of the lineup but the females in

87
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:40,810
the room have been successfully

88
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:42,939
pollinated the pistols are starting to

89
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,859
get brown they're kind of curling up it

90
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:46,989
has been about three or four days since

91
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:49,150
I pollinated and I can already see that

92
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,099
there are plenty of seeds developing in

93
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,049
that room I've cleaned up most of the

94
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,939
excess pollen I've taken a shot back and

95
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:57,370
sucked up all the corners I'll clean up

96
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:58,780
the room real well at this point I just

97
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,579
need to keep feeding the plants really

98
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,919
well and make sure nothing goes wrong in

99
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:04,780
just a few days I will adjust the timer

100
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,180
and I will give my plants more light to

101
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,509
encourage healthier fatter seeds and

102
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,510
those seeds should finish in about 50 to

103
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:15,729
60 days this episode should come out on

104
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:18,219
December 11th which means those seeds

105
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:21,250
should be ready around the end of

106
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,719
February so that is what is happening in

107
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,060
my garden we have had successful

108
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:27,699
pollination I can visibly see that the

109
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,170
pistils are curling up I can visibly see

110
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,659
the spots where seeds are beginning to

111
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,280
form the plants look very happy all of

112
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,790
the equipment in the room seems to be in

113
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,529
good shape

114
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,629
everything is dialed in everything is

115
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,250
running properly it is a little bit cold

116
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:41,079
outside which makes it really easy to

117
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,129
keep the temperatures in the room nice I

118
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,259
don't have to compete with the hot

119
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:47,259
sunshiny days this should be a very

120
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:49,599
successful situation I'm going to

121
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,909
increase the amount of light hours which

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,950
will make the seeds harvest earlier it

123
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,290
will also be fatter and more healthy so

124
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:58,300
right now I think we're on the perfect

125
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,550
path all right that's what's happening

126
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,860
in the grow room let's get on to the

127
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,350
main topic of this podcast I said I

128
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,000
wanted to cover some glossary terms some

129
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,290
things I may have missed in a previous

130
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,839
episode when I was talking about

131
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,000
breathing let's jump into that and talk

132
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,799
about some popular terms that you may

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,509
see on seed packaging you may see in

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,860
forums you just may hear people talking

135
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:19,779
about when it comes to growing and

136
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,480
breeding let's talk about some of those

137
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,699
terms in the last episode I kept saying

138
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,680
to work something to take a strain or a

139
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,959
plant and work it what did I mean by

140
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,879
work it let's say that I bought a pack

141
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,259
of seeds from a breeder that breeder is

142
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,909
called water bottle because there's a

143
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,189
water bottle in front of me so this

144
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,680
water bottle breeder sold me a package

145
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:41,079
of seeds and I grow those seeds I find a

146
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,360
male out of those seeds I've got free

147
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:45,189
reign to breed with that male because I

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,930
have paid for those seeds those are mine

149
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,819
nobody can tell me what to do in my

150
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,889
opinion nobody can tell me what to do

151
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,209
with my seeds nobody can tell me what to

152
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,189
do with my plants once I've paid for

153
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:55,989
them they're in my garden I've done my

154
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:57,730
work with them and I feel the same way

155
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,530
about the seeds that I breed that are

156
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,210
available to people if you've got my

157
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:03,909
seeds you're allowed to breed with them

158
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:06,039
I can't stop you I almost encourage it I

159
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,330
want to see what my plants will do in

160
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,670
future generations

161
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:11,079
I feel like breeding is really fun it's

162
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,000
really fulfilling and if that's

163
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,079
something you want to do my seeds offer

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,759
great potential

165
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,409
so I almost encourage you to breed with

166
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,480
my stuff but let's get back on track

167
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,070
I've got a pack of water bottle seeds

168
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,290
here this guy sold me some seeds they're

169
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:26,050
great I find a male in there I choose to

170
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,390
breed with that male that's cool but I

171
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,720
didn't work the male I just used water

172
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:34,810
bottles work to create more stuff what I

173
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,970
should do is use water bottles mail to

174
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,829
some other persons female or another

175
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,409
female that I've worked with and then

176
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:43,359
create my own seed and then use a male

177
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:45,038
out of that I've got to do some work to

178
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,959
it to kind of make it my own

179
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,028
not just grabbing stuff off the shelf

180
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,738
and mixing it together I've got to do a

181
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:52,868
little bit of ingredient working myself

182
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:54,248
I've got to do the work on my own so

183
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:56,800
that's what I mean when I say work it

184
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:58,659
and I just get a plant get a clone get a

185
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,848
male plant out of a pack of seeds and do

186
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:03,218
some dusting and make seeds that's

187
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:05,228
acceptable that works but it means a

188
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:06,459
little bit more when a breeder does some

189
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:08,438
working when you take things to

190
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,329
different generations when you in breed

191
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:11,979
or out breed or backcross or do some

192
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,988
work to it you just have to do a little

193
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:15,848
work make it your own instead of just

194
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:18,128
using that pack of seeds from water

195
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:20,649
bottle using his mail and making my own

196
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,059
seed company out of that so if you're

197
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,588
just breeding for your own personal

198
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:25,659
fulfillment feel free to use whatever

199
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:27,519
mail you've got access to that fits your

200
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:29,348
breeding criteria but if you're trying

201
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,689
to put something to market it's better

202
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:33,158
Attica to work something and build your

203
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:35,319
own mail instead of just pulling

204
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:36,668
something out of a pack and reproducing

205
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,800
more stuff out of that that's what I

206
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:39,549
meant when I kept saying work it and

207
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,319
make it your own

208
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,908
in the last episode now let's move

209
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,979
forward and talk about something a

210
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:47,050
little more useful what is a phrase that

211
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:50,860
I hear quite often that may be confusing

212
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:53,168
to some growers the phrase is clone only

213
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,749
in a previous episode I spoke about

214
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:58,538
Gorilla Glue number four being a clone

215
00:07:55,749 --> 00:08:01,088
only strain I also talked about golden

216
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:03,759
goat being a clone only and Girl Scout

217
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:06,550
cookies being a clone only now what do I

218
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,069
mean by a clone only strain what I mean

219
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,259
by a clone only is that no males of

220
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,300
these plants were ever released and no

221
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,699
seeds of these plants were ever released

222
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,098
by the original breeders so the female

223
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,919
that was released is known as a clone

224
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:22,598
only because there was no way to

225
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,149
reproduce that plant the only way it was

226
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,800
circulated was as a clone a very

227
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:29,348
specific cut and we're going to talk

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,209
about specific cuts and cut names in a

229
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:33,938
minute here so when I'm saying clone

230
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:36,038
only I mean it's only available in clone

231
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:38,588
form so something like golden goat and

232
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,718
gorilla glue those plants just happen to

233
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,610
be accident but they are also clone only

234
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,009
because the person who created those

235
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,139
plants never intended to make seeds for

236
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,250
commercial production so those seeds

237
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:50,318
were never released

238
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,110
they grew those small batches themselves

239
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:55,099
then they found the keeper the prized

240
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,759
cut out of those seats the

241
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,440
star phenotype then they gave that clone

242
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,800
out to their friends and they never

243
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,680
released any mails or any seeds so it is

244
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,539
a clone only female now I know people

245
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,939
are already going but I've got seeds of

246
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:13,370
golden goat you put out seeds of golden

247
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,110
goat how can that be a clone only there

248
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,990
are breeders like myself and many others

249
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,000
who have learned how to reverse plants

250
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,889
which means I can take a clone only

251
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,679
plant and I can treat it with a solution

252
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:26,990
that solution will trigger a hormone

253
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,120
reaction inside of the plant which makes

254
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,759
it create pollen sacks which contain

255
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,850
pollen which only contain female

256
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,980
chromosomes then I take that female

257
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,470
golden goat pollen and put it right back

258
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,829
on a female golden goat plant and I make

259
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,690
female golden goat seeds until that

260
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:46,159
became a popular practice and a lot of

261
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,399
people started learning how to do it

262
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,208
these clone only strains were much more

263
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,940
sought-after

264
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:55,789
and were much harder to acquire now I do

265
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,459
believe if you grow my golden goat from

266
00:09:55,789 --> 00:10:01,370
seed you should label the bag and all of

267
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:03,708
your plants golden goat s1 because it is

268
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,828
not the original golden goat cut it will

269
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:09,500
be a very close representation but it is

270
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:12,409
your responsibility to properly label it

271
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,778
as a golden goat s1 so that is what we

272
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:16,789
mean when we say a clone only that plant

273
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:18,889
is a clone only there were never seeds

274
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:20,539
released by the original breeder the

275
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,879
only way you're going to find seeds of

276
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:25,099
that is if somebody made feminized seeds

277
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,980
or perhaps maybe somebody did a back

278
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,300
cross but that needs to be labeled

279
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,449
appropriately if you're making seeds

280
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:34,789
please learn how to label them correctly

281
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:36,708
and please do not mislead people

282
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:39,198
now I also said we would talk about

283
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:41,419
specific cuts what does it mean when I

284
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:43,399
hear that there's a strain and then

285
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:46,610
there's a specific cut of that strain a

286
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:49,458
very popular example is the Mac from

287
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,699
kappa later the Mac is a plant that is

288
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:57,619
available in seed form so you can buy

289
00:10:52,698 --> 00:11:00,588
Mac seeds the Mac is also available in a

290
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:04,399
clone there is a very popular Mac cut

291
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:08,660
known as Mac one it is also known as cap

292
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,960
you laters cut now cap did release the

293
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:12,669
mash

294
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:16,009
in seed form but he has also shared his

295
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:17,870
favorite cut with his friends and there

296
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,000
is a story and some rules that go along

297
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,440
with the Mack cut you've got to share it

298
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,090
with growers that you respect and people

299
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,740
that you feel will deserve it and you

300
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,509
cannot take money for it it's got to be

301
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,070
gifted there are some rules that come

302
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:31,309
with that cut I really appreciate and

303
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:34,040
respect that but the one bit cap you

304
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:37,279
later gave out to people is caps cut

305
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,889
that is Mac one so it has been labeled

306
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,129
Mac one and caps cut to indicate that

307
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:45,199
that is the sought-after prized cut from

308
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:48,110
that batch of seeds you can buy the

309
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,930
seeds but you cannot label any of the

310
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:54,830
seeds they come from that batch caps cut

311
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:56,929
or Mac one you can label it the Mac if

312
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,750
that's what the seed pack says but you

313
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:02,599
cannot call it Mac one because Mac one

314
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,009
is a clone only and that's just the

315
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,659
first strain that came to the top of my

316
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:07,970
head when I wanted to talk about strains

317
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:10,909
that are clone onlys that have their own

318
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,879
specific name so that may also be known

319
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:16,490
as a breeders cut I've also got a prized

320
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:19,370
cut of my arise of course I've got

321
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,049
almost unlimited amounts of seeds of a

322
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,299
rise that I can grow through I have

323
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:25,309
grown a lot of a rise plants I've been

324
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:27,409
able to select my favorites out of

325
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:29,989
countless seeds I've got a cut that is a

326
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:32,480
champion if I were to release that I

327
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,950
call that the breeders cut that's the

328
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,600
one everybody would want that is the

329
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,940
best one you're going to find I've

330
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,100
called several to replace them with this

331
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,090
one and I upgrade any time I find one

332
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,610
that's better

333
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,399
that one replaces the older one so I've

334
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,899
got the breeders cut of a rise there

335
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,819
isn't a rise number for that I've

336
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,340
released to a few friends they carefully

337
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,830
label it a rise number four because that

338
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,019
is a popular sought-after cut that is

339
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,150
the breeders cut it is the number four

340
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,679
so that's how some of these strains get

341
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:03,649
their names that's why they get called

342
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,919
specific cuts you may see like the the

343
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:10,129
the profit the 505 cut that's because

344
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,439
the profit was bred by IRA genetics but

345
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:15,379
my friends down in Albuquerque found a

346
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,720
very beautiful phenotype of the profit

347
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,309
and they call it the 505 cut because

348
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,440
they pass it around and they share it

349
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:22,759
and so when other people grow the profit

350
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,470
and they offer clones

351
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,059
like hey I got clones at the profit

352
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,129
their friends will probably go

353
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:29,869
you got that 505 cut or did you just

354
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:32,000
grow it from seed because everybody's

355
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,610
gonna want that 505 that's the special

356
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,620
one so that's where you get specific cut

357
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,899
and specific cut names you may get

358
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,950
regional cuts you may get breeder cuts

359
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:45,919
also dispensaries have very popular cuts

360
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:48,200
of certain strains there is a dispensary

361
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,589
in Denver that grows the lemon Jeffrey

362
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,060
and they have got a very beautiful

363
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:55,759
phenotype of the lemon Jeffrey and they

364
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,589
do offer clones of it on occasion when

365
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,929
you get those clones you have got the

366
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,910
kind love cut so if you go to kind love

367
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:03,649
you get lemon Jeffrey you can call that

368
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:05,990
the kind love cut that is the one they

369
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,179
run that's the one that they share they

370
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,100
are known for that cut of that lemon

371
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:12,439
Jeffrey so that's how these certain

372
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,300
strains get their cut names or their sub

373
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,700
names they're either grown by a grower

374
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:19,009
who is popular and they get the cut

375
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,290
named after them the Rasta Jeff cut or

376
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:22,730
it could be regional or it could just

377
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:24,860
have some sort of a story behind it

378
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:28,009
that's also a popular thing another

379
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,529
thing that happens is sometimes the

380
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:33,319
breeders will identify specific

381
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:35,269
phenotypes before the seeds are released

382
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,240
and they will tell you to look for

383
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:40,610
specific phenotypes within the batches I

384
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,200
am known for identifying phenotypes in

385
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,909
my batches and I give very good

386
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,160
descriptions of the phenotypes on some

387
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:48,259
of my podcasts I'm gonna go off on a

388
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,959
little mini rant here I'm going to stop

389
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:53,120
talking so much about desirable

390
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,670
phenotypes because those are what are

391
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,460
desirable to me when you're growing a

392
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:00,259
pack of seeds from seed I feel like you

393
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,320
should find the phenotype that is more

394
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:05,210
desirable for you and your garden kind

395
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,340
of don't worry about what I said you're

396
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,200
growing it for you get what you like

397
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,910
I've got good recommendations but

398
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,320
sometimes I feel like when I start

399
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:14,719
talking about phenotypes

400
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,700
i sway people's hunt and they don't get

401
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,860
what they want they get what I want and

402
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,660
that's not why we're growing that's not

403
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,370
why we're Fino hunting so I'm going to

404
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:24,589
back off a little bit on some of my

405
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,120
phenotype recommendations I'll still

406
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,220
make descriptions and things but I'm not

407
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,960
going to recommend sometimes I often say

408
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,279
that one's the keeper I may get away

409
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,830
from doing that I'll say the one you

410
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,059
like the best is the keeper so let me

411
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,050
try to figure out where I was and get

412
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,698
back on track

413
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,708
I was working my way into talking about

414
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:41,958
a breeder who tells us about specific

415
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:44,539
phenotypes of a specific strain and what

416
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,578
I'm getting toward is Jillybean when you

417
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:49,308
buy Jillybean we know that we can look

418
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:52,159
for the candy-store Fino and the orange

419
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:54,469
vino those are two very popular and very

420
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,509
reliable phenotypes that will come out

421
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,819
of a pack of Jillybean so those are two

422
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,528
very popular phenotypes you always hear

423
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:03,169
about the candy store jill and the

424
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:05,058
orange jill so that's basically what we

425
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:07,909
mean when we say like basically a

426
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:09,438
subtitle or a sub name to a strain like

427
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:10,730
hey I've got the jellybeans and then

428
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:12,948
your buddy will go do you have the

429
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,079
orange cut or the candy store cut and

430
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:17,028
you'll go oh and then if you've got both

431
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,368
of them if you grow a pack of seeds it's

432
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:21,350
very likely you will get the candy store

433
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:23,269
and the orange and you won't know when

434
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,069
you smell you go oh that's obviously the

435
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,869
candy store then you smell the other one

436
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:29,778
you go oh that's obviously the orange

437
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:32,119
dominant phenotype so Jillybean is very

438
00:16:29,778 --> 00:16:33,828
well known for the orange and the candy

439
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:35,839
store phenotype that's where you start

440
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:37,458
hearing those subtitles I guess it is

441
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,100
when we're talking about strain names

442
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:42,828
now really quickly I should cover land

443
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,259
race genetics I am NOT an expert when it

444
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:47,088
comes to land races I have always said

445
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:49,789
that there are seed breeders and seed

446
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:53,569
collectors then there is a sub culture

447
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:56,028
of land race growers breeders and seed

448
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:58,278
orders they're kind of the subculture

449
00:16:56,028 --> 00:17:01,490
within the subculture the extra nerdy

450
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:04,099
among the nerdy so my take on land races

451
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,919
is essentially this land race seeds are

452
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:09,078
seeds that are acquired from a region or

453
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,860
the plants and the cannabis breeding has

454
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,869
not been disrupted by selection from man

455
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,490
so if you think about in some places

456
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,918
they've got a large field of cannabis

457
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,959
growing outdoors they let the males and

458
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,600
the females grow side-by-side they do

459
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,028
not remove the male plants those male

460
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,058
plants open pollinate all of the females

461
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:30,950
as the plants are harvested those seeds

462
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:32,778
are dropped right back into the ground

463
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,548
naturally just from the plants being

464
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:36,829
shaken by the harvest method just by

465
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:39,048
Nature despite being there those seeds

466
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:41,808
fall back into the ground then next year

467
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:43,609
those seeds grow up again male and

468
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:46,519
female plants are allowed to grow that

469
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:49,038
males are not cold those males pollinate

470
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,789
those females so each female plant

471
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,210
contain

472
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:55,700
seeds from multiple mail plants from

473
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,590
that area so this happens over

474
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,710
generations over generations without

475
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:02,750
being adulterated by mankind nobody goes

476
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,370
there and disrupts the breeding of these

477
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,589
plants the only thing that people are

478
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:08,418
doing is removing the finished plants we

479
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:10,069
are allowing the seeds to fall and they

480
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:12,830
are allowed to grow next year we aren't

481
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:15,079
doing any selection Nature is doing all

482
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:17,389
of the selection here for these seeds

483
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,819
the plants that grow the best in that

484
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,830
environment they thrive and they live

485
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:24,349
then those plants with survivor

486
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:26,509
instincts get pollinated the male's get

487
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:28,699
to shoot pollen the future generations

488
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:31,069
have those traits even more solidified

489
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,440
this has been happening for generations

490
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,519
among generations without interruption

491
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,340
of mankind

492
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:39,319
those are land race genetics if you go

493
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:40,970
to one of those regions and you acquire

494
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,159
those seeds and you bring them back home

495
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,500
those seeds you acquired we're land

496
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,140
races the minute you [ __ ] with them that

497
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,839
offspring is no longer a land race you

498
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,640
can label it secret tibetan mountain f2

499
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,259
or you can label it something like that

500
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,090
but you cannot call it a land race

501
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,460
anymore it has been adulterated by

502
00:18:56,089 --> 00:19:01,220
mankind it has been worked it is no

503
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,829
longer a land race worked by the land

504
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,929
there may be people who argue with my

505
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:08,329
definition of what a land races but to

506
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:10,730
my understanding to my standards that is

507
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:13,009
what I would call a land race seeds that

508
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,599
have been unadulterated by human

509
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:17,419
interaction they've been breeding and

510
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,579
selecting themselves in nature in their

511
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:21,950
own environment and they have adjusted

512
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:24,769
themselves to grow through evolution in

513
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,419
their environment alright ladies and
