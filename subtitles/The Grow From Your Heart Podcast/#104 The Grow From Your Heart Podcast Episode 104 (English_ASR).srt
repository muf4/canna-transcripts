45
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:37,750
joining me you guys I'm back in the

46
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,879
studio last time I was on I did an

47
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,478
episode from the car and I did a review

48
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:46,839
on the Jeep in slim disposable vaporizer

49
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,099
I used the concentrate version you know

50
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,478
when I was in the car I gave this thing

51
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:51,759
kind of a shitty review but let me tell

52
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,500
you that was a preemptive strike I got

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,569
home and I looked at it a little bit all

54
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,759
I had to do was patch pack the hash in a

55
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:59,469
little bit harder I press it down and

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,109
heat it up a little bit and it actually

57
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,989
gave me quite a few fat rips so I'm

58
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:07,420
going to AH what is it called withdraw

59
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:09,549
my my shitty review of this product and

60
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,729
I'm going to update it I'm going to give

61
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,260
it like 4 out of 5 stars for a vape pen

62
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,419
that's disposable this is probably the

63
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:19,109
best quality we're gonna find so like 4

64
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:21,789
out of 5 stars because for a DAB or a

65
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,370
wax hit or a concentrate hit I prefer a

66
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:26,348
rig you need a rig for 5 stars but it's

67
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,939
a good product if you're in Colorado and

68
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:29,259
you're picking up some concentrates and

69
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,270
you need something to smoke it through

70
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:32,229
these little yellow vape pens that

71
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,360
you're gonna throw away when you're done

72
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:37,030
I think these are an affordable and

73
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,890
economical deal so I apologize for the

74
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,159
shitty review my updated review says

75
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:43,329
it's a quality product alright so I want

76
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,400
to give the whole nation a shout out

77
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,910
everybody in America this is for you you

78
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,469
guys

79
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:50,379
Halloween just passed and guess how many

80
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:52,180
people reported finding cannabis laced

81
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,090

82
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,610
basket nobody that's right there were

83
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,989

84
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,849
given out for Halloween this year so a

85
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:02,530
big shout out we did the same shout out

86
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:04,060

87
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,129

94
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,240

95
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,620

106
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,800

108

community that travels around to all of

109
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,370
the cannabis shows and they set up their

110
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,530
booths and they take great care of the

111
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,810
customers and the community and they

112
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,060
really represent the cannabis movement

113
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,860

114
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,900

I've been bumping into people and

161
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,060
they've been talking about

162
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,740
why some people are able to take their

163
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,399
cannabis to the next level and some

164
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,840
people are stuck growing it's not mid

165
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,478
grade but it's still not stellar

166
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,519
cannabis so I thought that I would write

167
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,279
down some of the reasons why your herb

168
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:39,019
not yours but some herb is not what we

169
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,668
would consider top-shelf product and

170
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,008
then we could talk about a few ways on

171
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:46,609
how to improve that and get your herb up

172
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,960
to the top shelf so let me work on my

173
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,120
list here I got a couple things written

174
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,189
down all right you guys the main reason

175
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,379
I find the cannabis is not able to be

176
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,779
considered top shelf product is because

177
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:57,978
it has been over fertilized a lot of

178
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,168
people are thinking that they can add

179
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:01,758
more fertilizer and feed it more and

180
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:03,379
you're gonna get better product but

181
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,750
actually what you're doing is you are

182
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:07,370
pumping it full of nutrients that are

183
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,930
gonna affect the flavor it's gonna be

184
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,610
harder to flush that stuff out in the

185
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,610
end everything that you put into your

186
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,830
plants will affect the flavor another

187
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,479
big reason that I find a lot of cannabis

188
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:19,699
is not able to be considered top shelf

189
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:22,069
product is that it was not properly

190
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:24,259
flushed you guys your cannabis plants

191
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:27,199
need to be flushed for a minimum of ten

192
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:30,500
days preferably two full weeks before

193
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,210
harvest so 10 to 14 days before you plan

194
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,399
on cutting down your plants you need to

195
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:37,939
start watering it with just clean water

196
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:40,250
pH and about six five get in there and

197
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,870
just fill every pot fill the whole pot

198
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,120
with water so that it's dripping out of

199
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,129
the drain holes a little bit do that 14

200
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,930
days before harvest and then let it dry

201
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:49,339
up just like you normally would and when

202
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,199
you're gonna water again make sure you

203
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,728
water it until it drips out of the pot a

204
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,759
little bit and you don't want to give it

205
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:57,079
any nutrients for the last 14 days if

206
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,400
you're an experienced grower there

207
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,319
aren't a few things you can add at the

208
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,879
end there but I wouldn't recommend too

209
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,829
many things unless you really know what

210
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,389
you're doing that's this is where you're

211
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:08,029
really going to start affecting your

212
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:11,180
flavor so be careful at the end make

213
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:13,129
sure you flush for at least 14 days you

214
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,750
can go longer you I don't think you can

215
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:16,848
over flush if you feel like you start

216
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,079
flushing about 14 days before you think

217
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:19,728
you're gonna harvest and you feel like

218
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,740
those plants can go a few more days

219
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:23,389
don't worry let them go a few more days

220
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,250
they'll be just fine and they will taste

221
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,470
even better let them finish up let them

222
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,879
ripen up let them flush out let all the

223
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,550
nutrients come out and you'll be okay

224
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,019
you guys you may see some yellowing

225
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,490
hope for some yellowing that means

226
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,199
you're flushing it properly that means

227
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,240
that you're getting all the excess

228
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,949
nutrients out of the leaves that are

229
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,660
stored in the plants and you're gonna

230
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,279
flush that right on out that means that

231
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,780
there aren't extra nutrients left in the

232
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,579
soil that the plants eating it means

233
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,959
it's eaten all of its food and it's

234
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:51,259
getting cleaned up and it's almost time

235
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:53,509
for harvest now I want to take a step

236
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,360
back and say over fertilization and not

237
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:58,670
flushing are both possible even when you

238
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,680
were using organics you guys organic

239
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,050
nutrients can still burn your plants

240
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,120
organic nutrients can over fertilize

241
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,730
your plants be careful when using

242
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,139
organics you can add the wrong I mean

243
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,730
think about the way that stuff smells

244
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,800
when you're working with some organics

245
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,259
it literally smells like a pile of [ __ ]

246
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,600
if you over fertilize it they can make

247
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:20,629
your butts taste like a pile of [ __ ] it

248
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,430
is very possible also not flushing I

249
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,750
hear a lot of people say they don't have

250
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,900
to flush because they used organic

251
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,060
nutrients you need to flush if you're

252
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,739
using if you're using your own like

253
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,670
super soil and you know that you don't

254
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,779
need to flush because you've been

255
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,159
flushing the whole time you're an

256
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,629
experienced grower and you understand

257
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,490
that but if you're using a bottled

258
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:40,669
nutrient or some sort of organics or

259
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,409
most amended soils you're going to need

260
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,089
to flush you guys so make sure you flush

261
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,129
even with organics make sure you don't

262
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,639
over fertilize even with organics and

263
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:51,350
this can make your cannabis better if

264
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:53,000
you're using a bottled nutrient start

265
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,610
with about half of what they recommend

266
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,409
on the bottle about half of the dosage

267
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,259
rate and then if you see that you have a

268
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:01,610
deficiency move up you can correct you

269
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,379
can always add but you can never

270
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,779
subtract from what you've fed your

271
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:09,500
plants all right so don't over fertilize

272
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:12,289
and do flush the next thing that I see

273
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,860
that makes cannabis not able to be top

274
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:18,500
shelf is a really poor trim job you

275
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,899
would not believe how much very well

276
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,860
grown cannabis I have seen that would

277
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,199
have been top-shelf

278
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,820
if the grower would have taken just a

279
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,590
little bit more time to make sure to

280
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,300
take all those little tiny leaves off

281
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,980
you guys we don't want to see any leaves

282
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:33,469
when we're looking at the buds we want

283
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,480
to see trichomes we want to see resin we

284
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,129
want to see just just buds we don't even

285
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,600
want to see any stick at all just a

286
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:40,700
little tiny stick that sticks out of the

287
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,190
bottom of the bud that's all that we

288
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,420
need so when you're trim and make sure

289
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,520
you take off all those little tiny

290
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,740
pointy leaves get in there

291
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,689
clean that [ __ ] up cut all the little

292
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,600
sticks out cut your sticks off of the

293
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,370
big gigantic buds and trim your weed to

294
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,649
look like just buds look at a magazine

295
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,509
look online look what good quality bud

296
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,459
looks like and trim it up like that if

297
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:02,169
you can see an obvious leaf on there get

298
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,759
in there with your scissors and clip it

299
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:06,490
off get in there to thumbnail and knock

300
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,460
that off trim your we'd like connoisseur

301
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,649
grade weed and it will be top-shelf

302
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,850
alright and also wear rubber gloves you

303
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,929
guys when you're trimming your cannabis

304
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,080
make sure that you wear rubber gloves

305
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:18,789
and in my opinion top-shelf herb is hand

306
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,290
trimmed and not machine trimmed if

307
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:22,839
you've got machine trimmed bud that one

308
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:24,639
a cannabis cup I'm impressed ah let's

309
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,780
see what rubber gloves you guys whenever

310
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,740
you're touching these buds whenever

311
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:28,120
you're touching a product that

312
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,129
somebody's going to smoke make sure you

313
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,870
wear rubber gloves we do not want to

314
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,820
smoke your skin oils I don't want to

315
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,490
hear your skin oil or your skin moisture

316
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,460
sizzling my dab that's just so gross

317
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,799
so trim your weed wear gloves and use

318
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,980
scissors not a trim machine is something

319
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:49,000
I want to stress alright so another

320
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:51,399
thing that quite often deters people's

321
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,179
cannabis from being top-shelf product is

322
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,519
a very poor cure a lot of people are

323
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:00,339
trying to speed dry their cannabis you

324
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,710
guys the slower your buds dry the better

325
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,370
they are going to taste the better they

326
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:09,250
are going to smoke think about your goal

327
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,500
your goal is to eventually grind up this

328
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,059
bud and either roll a joint out of it or

329
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,450
pack a bowl or stuff it in your

330
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:18,429
vaporizer or most of us in how days are

331
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,560
going to stuff it into a tube and turn

332
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:22,569
it into BHO or a lot of your gonna

333
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,459
freeze it and turn it into ice wax or

334
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,740
something but anyway let's think about

335
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,450
what we're trying to do eventually most

336
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,730
of us are gonna grind up this herb and

337
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,650
roll a fat joint out of it now when you

338
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,529
smoke your joint you want it to smell

339
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,600
good you want it to taste good you want

340
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,039
it to get you nice and stoned but

341
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,450
something that you really want it to do

342
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,730
that you don't think about is that you

343
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,100
want it to burn nice and smoothly you

344
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,409
want it to burn evenly you want it to

345
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,450
burn and make a nice white ash you don't

346
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:51,969
want it to burn into this hard black

347
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,290
charcoal looking thing that hard black

348
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,210
charcoal that's in the bottom of your

349
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:56,949
bowl when you're done or that your joint

350
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,410
turns into that's nutrients that weren't

351
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,230
flushed out of the plant

352
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:04,318
ah anyway I'm backing up a little bit

353
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,629
but a lot of times a bad cure will make

354
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:09,870
your buds not burn properly when you're

355
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:11,850
curing your buds you are removing excess

356
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,000
chlorophyll from the plants you are

357
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:17,370
removing a water molecule from the THC

358
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,948
which makes the THC more psychoactive

359
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,169
you are also pulling chlorophyll which

360
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:24,269
is making the plants taste better

361
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:27,628
making your buds taste better so a

362
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:30,509
proper cure and not a speed dry is very

363
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:32,430
important of proper cure will definitely

364
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:35,639
affect the way that your buds burn

365
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:38,099
slowly drying your buds will suck out

366
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,620
all of that chlorophyll and it will suck

367
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,500
the moisture out slowly and your buds

368
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,750
will burn very nice and smoothly they'll

369
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,379
be nice and sticky and they will burn

370
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,028
very very well I've got an episode all

I feel like I'm way off topic let's get

391
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,970
back in the game here we are talking

392
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:35,490
about a poor cure is what makes your

393
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,830
buds not top-shelf because they don't

394
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:40,379
taste good and they do not burn properly

395
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:43,379
you guys it is very possible to have

396
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,879
nice sticky buds that are properly dried

397
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,860
and cured that will burn like a champ

398
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,929
stink up the whole [ __ ] neighborhood

399
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,909
and get you high a [ __ ] that's your goal

400
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:52,649
so listen to the episode learn how to

401
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:54,870
properly dry and cure the buds um

402
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:57,179
another thing don't try to speed dry

403
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,889
your weed you guys do not speed drive

404
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,079
cut it down hang it upside down and let

405
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:04,559
it dry properly that's what that's gonna

406
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,950
give you a huge advantage also here is a

407
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:10,139
major contributing factor to why I feel

408
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:13,440
like a lot of people's buds are not

409
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:16,919
top-shelf you guys people really love to

410
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,130
cut their buds way too early let that

411
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,319
[ __ ] grow let it finish just because the

412
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:25,289
packaging on your seed package says that

413
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,879
those seeds will be done in 60 days does

414
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:30,299
not mean that you have to cut them down

415
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,740
in 60 days get yourself a nice scope get

416
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,569
some sort of a scope where you can

417
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,580
magnify the size of your trichomes to

418
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,980
where you can see how many of them have

419
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,170
turned opaque how many of them have gone

420
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,060
cloudy and how many of them are amber

421
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:44,009
when you start seeing about 30 percent

422
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,949
amber trichomes is when it's time to

423
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:48,480
harvest you guys a lot of people are

424
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,150
just cutting weed down way too early

425
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,370
they're trimming it like [ __ ] there's

426
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:55,679
speed drying it and then they're trying

427
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,509
to get top-shelf prices for it and they

428
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,009
feel bad and they feel let down when

429
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:01,919
they're not able to sell their product

430
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:04,080
for a top-shelf price you've got to let

431
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,549
it finish you have really got to let it

432
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,230
finish it doesn't even taste right it

433
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,639
doesn't get you high enough and you're

434
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,350
not even getting the right weight if you

435
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,939
don't let it finish that last week or

436
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,670
two is really where it starts packing on

437
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,680
weight on a lot of strains so let the

438
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:18,779
weed grow longer quit cutting it too

439
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,959
early and it will really improve the

440
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,528
quality of your buds like I said get a

441
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,879
scopes

442
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:25,259
aren't watching the trichomes quit

443
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,970
paying so much attention to your

444
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,709
calendar and pay a little bit more

445
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,600
attention to the plants I understand

446
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:33,359
you're on a schedule but the plants are

447
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,670
the boss here and if you want a Plus

448
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,430
top-shelf buds this is what you're gonna

449
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:40,979
have to do alright so don't cut too

450
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:43,109
early now also you're going to have to

451
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,209
pay a lot more attention to the room we

452
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,039
can tell I can tell by looking at the

453
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:49,739
finished product if the room got too hot

454
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,049
or if the room got too humid or if you

455
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,448
had some sort of bug infestation or if

456
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:55,708
there was some sort of struggle a

457
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:57,568
professional grower can tell by looking

458
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,849
at your finished but what the problem

459
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:02,849
was off your buds are airy and fluffy

460
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,920
you probably got too hot in there if the

461
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,139
buds have this weird texture to them it

462
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:08,878
probably got too humid in there I can

463
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:10,769
spot bug damage on those leaves that

464
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,720
you're not cutting off I can see the

465
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:15,328
spider mite marks on those leaves you

466
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,550
guys so pay a lot of attention to the

467
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:20,068
room get good control of your rooms it's

468
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:21,628
all about the environment you have to

469
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:24,299
set up that room to have proper air flow

470
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:26,459
you need air exchange you need to get

471
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:28,229
the old stale air out of there and you

472
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,818
need to get fresh air in so that that

473
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,800
plant can breathe you don't want to be

474
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:35,969
trapped in a stale humid ass closet all

475
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:37,889
day neither do your plants so and they

476
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,449
also don't want to be too hot if you get

477
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:41,339
the plants too hot they start Fox

478
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:43,378
tailing the buds start getting wispy

479
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,839
it's just like in the summer time you

480
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,370
guys you guys you know what I'm talking

481
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,199
about when it gets all hot your junk

482
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,938
starts swinging down all low it's just

483
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,649
trying to cool itself down the plants

484
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:54,360
will do the same thing it starts

485
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,620
spreading its legs all far so that it

486
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,389
can get some air and it starts Fox

487
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,509
tailing that's from too much heat you

488
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:01,139
guys so if you get your grow room under

489
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:02,850
control

490
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,429
you will be able to produce better

491
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,870
cannabis get the bugs under control you

492
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,339
guys if you don't have bugs on your

493
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,898
plants your plants don't have to spend

494
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:11,759
all their energy fighting off these

495
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:14,838
predators and they're able to use all of

496
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:19,109
their energy into producing delicious

497
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:20,698
tasty trichomes and resin terpenes let

498
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,559
the plants focus on what they're

499
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,680
supposed to do

500
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,359
all right so um pay attention to the

501
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,769
room get the room under control is the

502
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,829
point of that part right there so

503
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:34,599
another reason why a lot of cannabis

504
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:38,019
that I see cannot be considered

505
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:42,189
top-shelf cannabis is because the grower

506
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:44,109
basically forgot the general rules of

507
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,110
growing he forgot to think about his

508
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:48,129
lights his air his water or his soil he

509
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,929
just kind of got it

510
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:52,870
sometimes as growers we get complacent

511
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,370
we get cocky we get egotistical we get

512
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:57,429
overconfident we get ahead of ourselves

513
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:59,969
that [ __ ] happens and sometimes that's

514
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:03,009
when you start worrying about something

515
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,539
that is really obscure and then you

516
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:06,069
forget about something that was really

517
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:07,420
basic you're trying some new trick

518
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:08,710
that's really gonna improve the crop

519
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,539
right this new trick is gonna make

520
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:14,200
everything [ __ ] magical it's gonna be

521
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:16,119
amazing but as I did that I forgot to pH

522
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,039
the nutrient solution before I watered

523
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,169
it something stupid like that you guys

524
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,180
just pay attention to the basics pay

525
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,830
attention to your lights pay attention

526
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,720
to the air pay attention to your water

527
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:27,399
and pay attention to your soil and

528
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,019
everything should be cool of course pay

529
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,269
attention to the plants look at the

530
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:33,490
leaves every day for bugs do all that

531
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:35,319
stuff but remember the basics you need

532
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,680
good lighting if you don't have good

533
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:40,809
lighting you can't grow quality buds you

534
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,880
can grow quality bud under a small lamp

535
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:44,859
I wouldn't go you know you can use it

536
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,780
250 you're not gonna grow cannabis cup

537
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:49,809
winning buds underneath the 250 watt

538
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:52,450
light you may do OK under a 4 you've got

539
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,889
potential under a 6 but I really think

540
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,200
if you're gonna grow cannabis cup

541
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,780
winning top-shelf a great buds you need

542
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,670
at least a thousand watt light at least

543
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:03,430
1000 watt light and you don't want to

544
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,160
try to put more than about a 4x4 or a

545
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,960
5x5 floor pattern worth of plants

546
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,550
underneath there you want your canopy to

547
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,680
be nice and tight under that thousand

548
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,720
watt light the light is the main

549
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,029
nutrient for your plants that's what the

550
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,100
plants want more than anything so have

551
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:20,500
enough lighting and also make sure you

552
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:22,779
have the right spectrum that's super

553
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,900
important don't forget about that ere we

554
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:27,460
sort of discussed err before ah don't

555
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,710
have too much humidity don't have too

556
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,809
much heat try to find a way to replenish

557
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:35,200
the co2 by replacing the air in the room

558
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:37,359
very often your water

559
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,038
mentioned this make sure your pH in your

560
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,750
nutrient solution before you're feeding

561
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,210
it to your plants make sure you're

562
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,069
checking your ppm s make sure you're

563
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,288
using good quality water if you can

564
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:49,778
start with reverse osmosis water that

565
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:51,908
would be ideal make sure you remember to

566
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:54,609
check the pH you guys a lot of people

567
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:56,139
simply have overlooked pH balancing

568
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:58,240
their water before they add it to the

569
00:19:56,138 --> 00:20:00,009
solute to the plants you want that about

570
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,630
six five ish depending on what strains

571
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:04,179
you're running depends on how far into

572
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,769
flour you are but make sure you've got

573
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:07,149
your nutrients measured properly you're

574
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:09,759
not over feeding the plants and you've

575
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:12,069
got them pH adjusted your soil you guys

576
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,720
you got to use a good quality soil you

577
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:15,700
can't be packing your dirt too tight you

578
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,558
need some aeration you need some air in

579
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,380
there you need some drainage in there

580
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:22,480
use good soil don't overlook that type

581
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,220
of stuff those are the basics that you

582
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,808
guys need to pay attention to that you

583
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,960
may have forgotten that sometimes I

584
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:30,579
forget I'm guilty of this as well this

585
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,460
is all small things that I'm trying to

586
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:34,898
remind you about so don't forget the

587
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,210
basics of growing and we can always

588
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:39,969
refer to the old rule called laws lights

589
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,038
air water and soil never forget those

590
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,538
and then of course you got to add love

591
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,798
in there because I think plants grow

592
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:48,038
with a lot of love you gotta love the

593
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,658
plants so another way to improve your

594
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,038
cannabis and this is gonna sound like

595
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:54,070
I'm just trying to make a sales pitch

596
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,730
here but you need good quality genetics

597
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:58,960
you guys unless you've got a top-shelf

598
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,230
cultivar and I'm gonna I'm gonna branch

599
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,028
here you guys quit saying strands it's

600
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,679
not a strand we don't smoke different

601
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:08,230
strands we don't grow different strands

602
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,519
we grow different strains and if you

603
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,798
really want to be difficult and

604
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,329
technical they are known as varietals

605
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:16,119
and then if you really want to be an

606
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:18,788
[ __ ] you would call it a cultivar so

607
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:22,058
a specific phenotype of a specific

608
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:24,970
strain would be a cultivar but I digress

609
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:26,500
use good genetics you guys grow a good

610
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,960
strain if you're stuck on growing that

611
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,730
strain and you can't get it to be what

612
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,829
you want it to be maybe it's time to buy

613
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,589
a pack of seeds and run those seeds and

614
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:37,269
find the one in there that does what you

615
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,740
need maybe you're simply held back by

616
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:41,288
the quality of the clones you've got

617
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,778
that could be your issue so use good

618
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:46,000
genetics do some research get some seeds

619
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:47,648
from a reputable breeder I am not

620
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,029
sponsored by the dank team.com

621
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,399
currently they do not pay for

622
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:53,889
any ads but I can fully recommend my

623
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,620
friends at the dank team.com they have

624
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,810
reliable seeds I used to say it all the

625
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:03,069
time you can get rare dankness mile hike

626
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:04,210
an adventure Sin City sour seeds those

627
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:05,559
are just a few of the people that I

628
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,000
would recommend of course I read

629
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,369
genetics if you can get your hands on it

630
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,339
get yourself some good quality seeds

631
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:15,189
from a reputable breeder do a Fino hunt

632
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:18,009
find the best one out of there for you

633
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,720
and maybe that will help you improve the

634
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:21,519
quality of your cannabis maybe it's just

635
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,200
that clone that you're growing isn't

636
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,720
going to get any better maybe it's got

637
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,789
maybe its potential is only 17 percent

638
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,220
THC no matter what you do to it it's

639
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:31,899
just a genetic thing my genetics say

640
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,150
that I'm not gonna be able to jump six

641
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,680
feet high no matter what I do I can't

642
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,320
jump high I'm a white I'm a white man

643
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,580
they can't jump it's just my genetics

644
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,609
sometimes these plants aren't gonna go

645
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:45,279
much further than their potential so get

646
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:47,379
good genetics hey you guys we talked

647
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,420
about lights air water and soil but what

648
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,930
we got to think about is do not overlook

649
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,880
the vegetative stage of growth from day

650
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,340
one when you get those clones when you

651
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,370
crack those seeds from the very

652
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:03,099
beginning of the grow you are working on

653
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:05,079
the quality of that cannabis you may

654
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:06,669
just say hey it's a veg I can just put

655
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,589
it under these weak lights I don't need

656
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,070
a lot of good air I don't need to feed

657
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:14,679
it good soil good nutrients but really

658
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:16,689
good teenagers and good kids make good

659
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,400
adults so why doesn't the same [ __ ] work

660
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,440
with plants I think you need to take

661
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,670
really good care of those baby plants

662
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,269
because that is the beginning of

663
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,850
everything

664
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:26,950
you need to create a nice root zone you

665
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:29,259
need to create a nice thick stalk you

666
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,240
need a nice node structure you need nice

667
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:35,029
strong supported branches

668
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,058
you need nice topping you need nice a

669
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:40,039
nice canopy you need nice pruning just

670
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:42,289
take very good care of the plants in the

671
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,178
veg phase and you will be very prepared

672
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:46,579
for happy healthy plants when you go

673
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:48,259
into the flowering stage so pay more

674
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:50,210
attention to the veg phase I think a lot

675
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:52,819
of people overlook the vegetative stage

676
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,130
of cannabis growing so that's a way that

677
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:58,609
you could definitely improve the quality

678
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,500
of your cannabis alright guys I've got

679
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:01,819
one more thing that I really think would

680
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,829
help improve the quality of your

681
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:06,169
finished product and it will also help

682
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:08,419
improve the quality of your concentrates

683
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,269
if you're a hash maker something you

684
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,519
really need to do is clean your grow

685
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:15,500
room okay make sure that the floor is

686
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,389
clean make sure that the tops of your

687
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,710
light reflectors are dusted off make

688
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,420
sure that the air conditioner gets

689
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,429
cleaned make sure that all the blowers

690
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,870
and the carbon filters the tops of them

691
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,030
sometimes they collect a little dust

692
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:28,039
clean those make sure that your carbon

693
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:29,839
filter covers get cleaned occasionally

694
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:32,539
hey guys you got to go in there and

695
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,699
clean up ah if you've got a shop vac

696
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:37,190
with a good filter on it get in there

697
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,779
and shop vac the corners clean the [ __ ]

698
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,940
out of that grow room because every

699
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:43,220
piece of dust and particulate that is in

700
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,470
the air will end up sticking to your

701
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,670
plants if you've ever taken a picture of

702
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,549
a cannabis plant and there's a little

703
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,558
hair in there you understand exactly how

704
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:52,970
bad anything and everything will stick

705
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,740
to your cannabis plants while they're

706
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,000
growing you'll never be able to get the

707
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,429
hair out of it you'll never be able to

708
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,679
get the dust out so clean up the grow

709
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:02,540
room if you've got long hair if you've

710
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,130
got a beard think about keeping that

711
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:06,079
[ __ ] out of the plants to do what you

712
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,940
can I can't talk too much [ __ ] I've got

713
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,889
dreadlocks that go almost to my knees

714
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,519
I've got to wear a big-ass hat just to

715
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:15,650
go in the grow room so try to be

716
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,359
sanitary try to be clean try to be dust

717
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,980
free try to clean up all that [ __ ] all

718
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,169
of that stuff is going to stick to your

719
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,269
buds all that stuff is going to end up

720
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,890
in your finished product all that stuff

721
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:26,299
is going to end up in your concentrate

722
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,520
so just think about all the dust and

723
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:29,899
whatever that is its soil and whatever

724
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:33,139
else you're dragging around in the grow

725
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,669
room that's all going to end up in your

726
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,989
finished product

727
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:37,609
all right you guys so I'm gonna do a

728
00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:39,590
quick recap I've gone through my list

729
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:41,749
let's go real quickly if you want your

730
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:44,658
buds to be a little bit better than they

731
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:46,460
are maybe you could uh pay more

732
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,320
attention to your feeding maybe you

733
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,879
could flush a little bit better you

734
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,618
could possibly trim up your buds a

735
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:54,230
little bit better you could probably

736
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:55,699
improve the quality of your drying and

737
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,470
curing method which all you'd have to do

738
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,149
is listen to episode number 35 and

739
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,339
that'll give you huge steps on how to do

740
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:03,378
that you could probably let your plants

741
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:04,699
grow a little bit longer pay attention

742
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:05,118
to the harvest date that would help you

743
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,369
out

744
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:09,439
you could probably pay more attention to

745
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:10,999
the room and dial the room in a little

746
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,159
bit better you could probably work on

747
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:14,989
not having bugs another good way to

748
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:17,179
improve the quality of your cannabis is

749
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:20,149
to remember the basics and remember the

750
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,798
fundamentals of growing another huge way

751
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:25,579
to improve the quality of your grow is

752
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:28,009
to use quality genetics from a reputable

753
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:30,710
breeder another good way is to not

754
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:33,710
overlook your veg phase and of course

755
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,058
clean up the grow room and then of

756
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,278
course we've got a little side note here

757
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:39,108
that says good lighting so make sure

758
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,849
you're using proper lighting and also

759
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:42,470
you guys good nutrients good quality

760
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,528
nutrients will get you a long way make

761
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,639
sure your plants are properly fed um

762
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:48,858
there are a few things that I think

763
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:50,959
would work with every feed regimen if

764
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:54,319
you wanted to add dehydrated coconut

765
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,999
water and also yucca extract those

766
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,058
things will definitely improve your

767
00:26:55,999 --> 00:27:00,350
cannabis with almost any feed regimen if

768
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:01,460
you're going hydro you're gonna have to

769
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:03,259
figure out how to add those to your

770
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,519
hydro regimen it's a little bit

771
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,349
different but if you got a soil mix

772
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,210
going on those things that definitely

773
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:09,528
make your plants taste better if your

774
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,389
plants are burning and making black

775
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:13,759
ashes you're probably over new training

776
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:14,868
/ nutrient tting over feeding over

777
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,429
fertilizing that's what I think I'm

778
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:19,158
trying to say and you're not flushing

779
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:20,720
properly so work on those things you

780
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,669
guys that's all I've got for this

781
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,429
episode I'm gonna start wrapping up the

782
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:27,080
show I will be back in about I'm not

00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:34,909

787

788
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:38,629
I've chased him down for a day and it

789
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:40,699
was hard to find him so he did not

790
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:44,628
record with him yet but we will in the

791
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:46,009
