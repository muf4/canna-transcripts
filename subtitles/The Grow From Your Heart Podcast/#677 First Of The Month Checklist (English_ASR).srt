00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,878
enough let's get right to the main part

86
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,239
this show will come out right before the

87
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,000
first i think it actually comes out on

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
the 31st if there are that many days

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
this month i didn't keep good count we

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,360
should be right about the first as this

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,120
episode comes out as many people listen

92
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,440
to this episode it will be the first of

93
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,200
the month this is a good time to run

94
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,959
through a checklist of things in our

95
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,439
garden to make sure that everything is

96
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,959
in top working condition a lot of things

97
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,199
get overlooked

98
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,519
we get busy i'm extremely busy it is

99
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,919
outdoor season it is harvest season uh

100
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,759
we're shifting from the uh summer to the

101
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,079
fall from the warm to the cold is what i

102
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,318
call it so we've got to rebuild all the

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,760
indoor grows it is harvest time for the

104
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,238
outdoor season they're going to be a lot

105
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,079
of seeds to shuck it is going to be busy

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,599
when you get that busy a lot of things

107
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
get overlooked i always say that there's

108
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,878
that one corner that doesn't get swept

109
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,238
there's always that one tray that

110
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,158
doesn't get washed there's that one

111
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,640
plant in the back that gets ignored it

112
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,560
is now time to make sure we get to all

113
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,318
those small details because over time

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,560
they will build up and that's what

115
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,039
causes us problems stay on top of your

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,799
[ __ ] so my point is it is the first of

117
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,560
the month it is a good time to go

118
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,560
through the checklist it's also payday

119
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,400
so you should have a few bucks to handle

120
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,239
any supplies or corrections that need to

121
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,840
be made and if not now's the time to

122
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
start thinking about budgeting more

123
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,080
properly for the grow because [ __ ] will

124
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,879
come up things will go awry and we've

125
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,199
got to return money into our investment

126
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,399
if we want it to keep returning for us

127
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,639
all right let me get myself back on

128
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,079

129
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,800

00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,439
the lights cool down before you clean

153
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,600
them clean all the glass if you've got

154
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,719
leds clean the diodes really carefully i

155
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,560
don't know how you do that with your

156
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,960
lights read the instructions but it may

157
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,439
be time to clean your lights and your

158
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,959
equipment i had some fungus gnats but he

159
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,399
gave me a clone and it came with free

160
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,560
fungus gnats my fault should have

161
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,319
quarantined that sucker better but

162
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
around my grow light there are a bunch

163
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,439
of fungus gnats right around the led

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
bulb so i had to get some q-tips and

165
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,719
some rubbing alcohol and clean out all

166
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,478
the dead fungus gnats there's things

167
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
like that that will need to be done

168
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,560
clean everything that thing you've been

169
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,240
avoiding there's something we've all got

170
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,319
that one area that one little thing

171
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
that's a pain in the ass to clean clean

172
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,839
it now's the time just take a moment

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,839
just dedicate that day to it it is

174
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,279
cleaning day let's do it let's talk

175
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,159
about stuff in depth that we should

176
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,599
clean filters we often overlook cleaning

177
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
filters you've got air conditioner

178
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,759
filters that need to be cleaned are your

179
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,759
carbon filters still working how long

180
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,919
have those carbon filters been around do

181
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
you need to replace them the next time

182
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,918
you replace your carbon filter get a

183
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,080
piece of duct tape and write the date on

184
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,758
that duct tape and put that somewhere on

185
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,000
your carbon filter just so you can look

186
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,520
and say this has been here for a year

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,959
it's almost time to change it they're

188
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,879
supposed to give you two years they're

189
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,560
supposed to be good for two years

190
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,240
mine don't last that long which is a

191
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,839
compliment i'm thinking that i'm growing

192
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,519
the dank and you can smell it and that

193
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,679
carbon filter just ain't working so i

194
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,359
replace it about every year or so maybe

195
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,439
every year and a half even though you're

196
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,319
supposed to get two years

197
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,399
is it working go outside give it a smell

198
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,800
leave for a little while don't come back

199
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,638
directly into the grow area walk around

200
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,720
outside the grow area and see can you

201
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,639
smell it bring somebody new see if they

202
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
smell it you've probably gone nose blind

203
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,038
and you don't even smell your grow

204
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,959
anymore

205
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,279
let's be safe is the carbon filter

206
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,359
working so clean your filters your air

207
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,758
conditioner filters your carbon filter

208
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,680
what about uh in your hydro setup i know

209
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,919
when i run a hydro setup i put a filter

210
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
that goes from the tank uh between the

211
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,918
tank and the emitters there is a filter

212
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,519
thing it's like a 45 degree angle that

213
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,198
hangs down so that all the heavy [ __ ]

214
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,598
falls into there as the water passes

215
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,280
through the watering system has that

216
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,360
filter been taken out and cleaned

217
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,198
thoroughly have you cleaned your hydro

218
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,879
lines like the whole system starting

219
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,360
from the pump all the way down to the

220
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,120
emitters maybe just uh take the emitters

221
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
out of the plants if you can and just

222
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,639
run some sort of cleaner through there

223
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,240
maybe an enzyme maybe some faizan

224
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,840
something just to clean all that [ __ ]

225
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,918
out of there you may be surprised what

226
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,560
comes out of your watering system when i

227
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,598
build tables with long big auto watering

228
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,959
systems and long pvc pipes and long

229
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,959
flex tubes

230
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,719
we make a cap on one inch where we can

231
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,638
open it and actually blast water through

232
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,319
and clean it and you would be amazed at

233
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,079
all the nutrient build up and all the

234
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,840
gunk and junk that builds up inside

235
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,598
those lines and you don't know it's

236
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,359
there and you're basically feeding the

237
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,800
plants that stuff every time you're

238
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,800
watering and you don't know it's there

239
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
so take a minute clean out your hydro

240
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,079
lines all that stuff may be built up

241
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,919
with gunk

242
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,680
use an enzyme an enzymatic product will

243
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,758
definitely help break that down physe

244
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,079
antonia will push it out then make sure

245
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,680
you rinse that stuff out of your system

246
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,439
out of the hydro lines out of all the

247
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,360
tubes out of everything before you put

248
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,199
it back uh put the emitters back in the

249
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,199
plants we don't want to put

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,879
hydrozyme or too much hydrozyme or too

251
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,160
much physant into the plant so the

252
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,360
natural part is fine but you don't want

253
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,520
to do too much

254
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
uh the cleaning ratio will be stronger

255
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,279
than what you're using for feeding so

256
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,478
clean all those tubes uh clean the glass

257
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,719
on the lights i talked about if you have

258
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,639
vented lights clean that glass between

259
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,400
the bulb and your canopy clean that

260
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,158
that's going to reduce if that is dirty

261
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,838
that's going to drastically reduce the

262
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,000
amount of lumens

263
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,680
that make it from the light bulb down to

264
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,918
your canopy that glass is already

265
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,079
cutting enough down any speck of dirt

266
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,000
any foliar feed any pesticide spray that

267
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,759
gathered on that lens is going to

268
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
drastically reduce the amount of light

269
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,720
that makes it to your canopy it will

270
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,879
drastically reduce light penetration

271
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,639
speaking of bulbs how long has it been

272
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,799
since you've taken a light meter a lumen

273
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,958
meter a par meter any sort of meter to

274
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,599
your lights to test how much they're

275
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,119
putting out if you're using hps or uh

276
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
metal halides

277
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,560
they put out a hundred percent you can

278
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,679
turn them down but they're still putting

279
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,879
out whatever you've got it turned to

280
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,120
it's putting out a hundred percent of

281
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,759
that power is the bulb giving you a

282
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,000
hundred percent of those lumens

283
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,039
my recommendation when you get a new

284
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,559
bulb get a par meter uh some sort of a

285
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,958
meter something reliable that you're

286
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,199
going to use next time also a basic

287
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,000
lumen meter is perfect get a piece of

288
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,920
string or a ruler or a tape measure some

289
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,360
way that you can measure consistently

290
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,039
what i'm going to say is get a piece of

291
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,800
string about 18 inches long it's about

292
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,480
18 inches right get a piece of string

293
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,559
about 18 inches long and tie it to the

294
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,320
end of your lumen meter put one end at

295
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,159
the light and then hold it the length of

296
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,000
that string now every time you measure

297
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,838
you're 18 inches from the light and see

298
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,320
what the number is on your lumen meter

299
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,080
write that number down then every few

300
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,760
months every couple of months hold that

301
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,200
lumen meter up to the light at the same

302
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,159
distance and see what number it is

303
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,800
showing you if it's gone down to if it's

304
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,480
30 50 less than what it was showing you

305
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,958
it is definitely time to change that

306
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,879
bulb you're paying for a hundred percent

307
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,159
of that electricity and you're getting

308
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,399
50 to 70 of the output from that bulb if

309
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,319
you swap out that bulb you'll get 100

310
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,919
output again you'll be getting the

311
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,399
electricity that you're paying for is

312
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,679
the cost of that bulb offsetting the

313
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,440
waste of electricity that you're

314
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,599
spending you're pumping the electricity

315
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,839
into it let's have a bulb that will give

316
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,079
us the light that we're paying for right

317
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,839
so test your bulbs mark the date

318
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,559
somewhere when you do get a new bulb

319
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,160
when you do finally replace those bulbs

320
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,838
at the grow store that i used to shop at

321
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,679
a long time ago before things got real

322
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,120
busy when you would buy a new bulb they

323
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,958
would take the bulb out of the box and

324
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,440
write the date on the little copper part

325
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,359
that screws into the the fixture that

326
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
was a cool idea but if i wanted to see

327
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,320
the date of my bulb i had to unscrew it

328
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,759
and take it out of there and look now i

329
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,680
take a piece of duct tape and i write

330
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,078
the date that i put a new bulb in my

331
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,159
light fixture and i put that duct tape

332
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,599
on the light fixture and i want to know

333
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,799
when that light went in there it's

334
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,480
printed right there on the light fixture

335
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,719
i just got to look right there says that

336
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,320
one in january first i've got plenty of

337
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,839
time on that bulb let's measure the

338
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,360
lumens i know how long it's been there i

339
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,120
don't know how many lumens it's given me

340
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,959
things are working out make some notes

341
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,200
set yourself up for success all of the

342
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,679
notes you make are setting yourself up

343
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
for success we smoke that's why we grow

344
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,838
most of us are consumers that's why we

345
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,240
grow that's what inspired us to grow

346
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
i really enjoy getting just a nice

347
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,799
little buzz just getting in the zone you

348
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,799
know what i mean just a little stony

349
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,240
focus get baked a little bit and then go

350
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,159
in the grow and put on some music and

351
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,519
just get in the zone and get work done

352
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,639
but then sometimes i'll come out and be

353
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,639
like huh i don't even know what i just

354
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,958
did for the past four hours in the grow

355
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,039
make some notes do some documentation

356
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,799
set yourself up for success that way if

357
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,078
you do something you got a note like hey

358
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,838
i did this and this and this and the

359
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,439
next time you want to do great results

360
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,440
you got some notes you say i did this

361
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,600
and this and this it works just the same

362
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,200
when you're marking down your equipment

363
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,639
when did i buy these bulbs when did i

364
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,639
buy this carbon filter when did i

365
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,959
install whatever equipment i'm using

366
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,959
when did i buy that air conditioner

367
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,599
all that stuff write it down keep your

368
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,119
receipts also because when [ __ ] breaks

369
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,480
and you want to argue with them for

370
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,399
their warranty you're going to need that

371
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
receipt where am i on this list i've got

372
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,240
a lot of stuff going on

373
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,920
uh mark all your dates and new stuff

374
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,759
down some more easy to find either on a

375
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,679
clipboard on the door or put duct tape

376
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,360
on the gear that you're marking the date

377
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,039
uh the filters and the emitters on your

378
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,399
hydro setup those need to be cleaned

379
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,159
i've talked about that already they need

380
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,839
to be cleaned in a big commercial

381
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,480
environment i was cleaning those almost

382
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,160
every day we would walk through uh as

383
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
we're watering walk the rows and make

384
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,278
sure all of the emitters are spraying

385
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,278
and if one's not spraying you'd have a

386
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,439
little bucket or a little uh dish with

387
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,159
more emitters in your hand just pull one

388
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,920
out

389
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,838
put pull the dead one out put the fresh

390
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,838
one in and then we'd go put those dirty

391
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,160
emitters in a bucket with either like

392
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,519
rubbing alcohol or physin or h2o2

393
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,719
something just to kind of pre-clean them

394
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,560
and then later in the day somebody would

395
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,399
go and poke them clean them up put those

396
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,759
in the clean bin then you got new fresh

397
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,159
ones tomorrow so that when you find all

398
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,838
the dead emitters just replace them and

399
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,120
that's because we used a bunch of chunky

400
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,920
nutrients some of the stuff we were

401
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,000
using uh the carbonaria and the shine

402
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,439
together would really clog up the hydro

403
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,759
system so we'd really have to do some

404
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,279
cleaning on that i am kind of rambling

405
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:09,039
let's get myself back on focus um

406
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,720
clean all of the equipment you know the

407
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,719

414
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,958
uh do you have let's see let me get

415
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,799
myself back on notes because i do have

416
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,799
some notes here clean the ceiling start

417
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,958
at the ceiling uh you may not think the

418
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,359
ceiling's dirty it is clean the ceiling

419
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,278
clean the walls clean the floor uh

420
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,320
everything in between there give it a

421
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,480
clean is the dosatron working properly i

422
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,959
know that's a big uh big facility device

423
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,120
but let's test that thing is it working

424
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,359
properly let's go and make sure like if

425
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,159
you've got this bottle set up to spit

426
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,519
seven milliliters per dosing every time

427
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,198
just pull out the emitter and see if

428
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,560
it's actually spitting out however many

429
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,639
milliliters you think it's actually

430
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,000
spitting out test the dosatron let's see

431
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,360
if all the auto uh auto automated

432
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,799
equipment automated was the word i'm

433
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,320
looking for i promise see if all of the

434
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,159
automated feeding equipment is working

435
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,839
is all of the automation working we pay

436
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,399
a lot of money for automation we pay a

437
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,480
lot of money to rely on that stuff is it

438
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,240
working the way we think it is working

439
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,320
let's test all of those things anything

440
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,320
you think you've got set to cycle on or

441
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
cycle off at a certain time have you

442
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,120
checked it in a while have you checked

443
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,039
the timers are the timers where you

444
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,639
think they are sometimes you think that

445
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,919
you change that fan to come on at a

446
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,519
certain time and go off at a certain

447
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,439
time when you change the timer but maybe

448
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,879
you missed a fan or something check on

449
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,240
all of that stuff i'm just double

450
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,919
checking because it's the first of the

451
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,759
month it is a good time to make a

452
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,360
checklist and run through and make sure

453
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,759
you've got everything because again we

454
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,600
do get overloaded as growers we also

455
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,000
smoke a little bit of ganja so we do

456
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,519
have a tendency to miss some detail so

457
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,399
i'm just trying to make a list to help

458
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,198
you out to set you up for success now

459
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,278
what else are we going to think about um

460
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,278
the are the drains clear i've got the

461
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,360
luxury and a commercial environment to

462
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,120
have a floor drain are all those drains

463
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,399
clear do they need to be clear do we

464
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,078
need to run a snake down there do we

465
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,759
need to get a plumber do we need some

466
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,759
help getting those drains cleared how

467
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,519
are the drains now let's talk about

468
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,480
stuff that everybody's got going on in

469
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,240
their grow the scissor and mix area i've

470
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,159
got a little table where i keep my

471
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,720
scissors and all my mixing stuff and my

472
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,879
notes is that area cleaned up is that

473
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,360
clean and tidy you can get more work

474
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,360
done if you've got a nice area set

475
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,959
yourself up for success don't have all

476
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,360
kinds of excessive [ __ ] on your

477
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,359
workspace if you use these bottles maybe

478
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,039
have these bottles right here have some

479
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,720
notes here on how to use them have your

480
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,679
measuring equipment have some scissors

481
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,519
have like

482
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,919
some towels or some rags to clean up

483
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,198
some messes have your safety equipment

484
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,479
but then you don't really need a lot of

485
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,479
other you don't need a bunch of

486
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
excessive [ __ ] around it just makes it's

487
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,480
distracting and it makes messes and it

488
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,319
will slow you down so is your area clean

489
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,360
how about your scissors and your mixing

490
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,600
cups are they clean i use a scale for

491
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,360
powder nutrients is your scale for

492
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,360
measuring nutrients clean is it

493
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,360
calibrated that's something important to

494
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,360
think about is that scale calibrated

495
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,440
because i'm using that to measure

496
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
five grams of powdered nutrients per

497
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,240
gallon of water if that thing is off

498
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,320
then i am not feeding properly at all

499
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,560
which we can double check with our ec

500
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,120
and our ph meters are those clean and

501
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,359
calibrated those need attention as well

502
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
um something we may not think about but

503
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,399
i think needs attention are the smoke

504
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,560
alarms the smoke detectors and

505
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,278
carbon monoxide detectors have they been

506
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,958
tested are they working are they in good

507
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,078
working condition those are gonna

508
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,799
possibly save a life so fire alarms uh

509
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,399
co2 alarms and then you need that fire

510
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,319
extinguisher if you do have a fire

511
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,399
hopefully you've got a fire extinguisher

512
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,240
check that bad dog do you know how to

513
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,078
use the fire extinguisher having it is

514
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,919
one thing knowing how to use it is

515
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,439
another thing do you know how to use it

516
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,599

aid kit could really help you out uh

562

564
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,439
something i'm not sure what you might

565
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,679
need but a basic first aid kit could

566
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,840
really help you out speaking of basic

567
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,679
first aid how about personal protective

568
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,839
equipment a lot of us are applying

569
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,759
pesticides or doing some sort of spray

570
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,439
applications in our grow have you

571
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,038
cleaned your respirator do you know how

572
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,558
to clean your mask properly have you

573
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,798
been properly trained or have you read

574

575
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,480
mask are your cartridges up to date

576

you've got to have the proper cartridges

577
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,160
in your mask and they've got to be uh

578
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,240
new and not expired and not have too

579
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,160
many miles on them or you're basically

580
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,240
just wearing that mask for discomfort so

581
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,960
you keep your carts up to date and keep

582

585
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,038
recycle those suits

586
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,038
basically you guys clean everything

587
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,558
this is just basically a responsibility

588
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,038
checklist that i'm just trying to remind

595
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,880
take very long pour a cleaner in there

596
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,480
hit it with a rag let it dry next time

597
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,000
you need to use it it's nice and clean

598

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,839
the grow looks good you've set yourself

600
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,360
up for success it's one less problem

601
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,959
you're gonna have in the future one less

602
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,798
thing slowing you down when you're

603
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,798
trying to get work done let me catch my

604
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,240
breath and see where i am in the notes

605
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,918
how long has it been since you've

606
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,599
cleaned your sprayer whatever you were

607
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,200
spraying your plants with how long has

608
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,959
it been since you've actually given that

609
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
thing a good cleaning i've got a

610
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,279
handheld pump sprayer and the commercial

611
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,359
grow we use paint sprayers sometimes

612
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,279
those will need maintenance the handheld

613
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,959
sprayer you need to run some clean water

614
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,399
through it and clean that hose out there

615
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,159
might be stuff stuck in the tubes and

616
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,919
you don't want to spray the wrong

617
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,600
product on your plants at the wrong time

618
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,200
if you think you've mixed up this and

619
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,279
there's still some of the last previous

620
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,360
spray left in the tubes that could cause

621
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,678
problems the paint sprayers can be a

622
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,918
pain in the ass they oftentimes need

623
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,240
re-primed and they definitely need to be

624
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,559
cleaned out very frequently so keep your

625
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,839
paint sprayer up to speed by just

626
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,240
general maintenance there are a lot of

627
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,000
good videos i found that almost every

628
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,159
brand paint sprayer i think the one that

629
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,279
we like the most is the graco they've

630
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,880
got a great

631
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,798
youtube presence where you can read

632
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,400
about re-priming and cleaning all those

633
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,918
machines really easily they don't pay me

634
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
to talk about that but i think it's

635
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,200
really helpful for you if you've got i

636
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,279
think it's graco is the name of the

637
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
brand the blue one right i can see it on

638
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,839
my head i've got the image in my head

639
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,400
but i can't think of the name of the

640
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,480
brand i'm pretty sure it's graco

641
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,559
if you go to youtube and type in graco

642
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,519
paint sprayer all the info you need is

643
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,960
right there they'll teach you how to

644
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,879
take it apart and rebuild it and you can

645
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,558
do it in just a couple of hours save

646
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,000
yourself a lot of money on a maintenance

647
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,759
plan from that company because they'll

648
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,759
come fix it for you but you can do it

649
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,960
yourself it's really easy and you don't

650
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,798
want to wait for them if you need to

651
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,120
spray today you need that [ __ ] fixed and

652
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,639
they take a week to come so yeah just

653
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:09,759
fix it yourself all the videos are right

654
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
there on youtube so take care of your

655
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,960
paint sprayer clean that [ __ ] out if

656
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,240
that's what you're using a lot of people

657
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,400
will tell me that a paint sprayer isn't

658
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,519
the way to go it's very effective for me

659
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,360
i like what i'm doing with that if

660
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,519
you're using a fogger now is definitely

661
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,158
the time to clean out your fogger ah

662
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,038
clean that [ __ ] up is it time to do a

663
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,320
dump run um we are approaching harvest

664
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,480
season right now people are going to

665
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,119
have a lot of sticks a lot of stems a

666
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,960
lot of root balls a lot of leftover junk

667
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,798
that they don't need from the grow

668
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,079
where's that gonna go

669
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,599
if you've got an indoor grove and you're

670
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,439
pulling down crops every couple of

671
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,199
months where are all those sticks and

672
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,840
root balls and leftover where's all that

673
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,640
[ __ ] going is it time for you to do a

674
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,158
dump run sometimes my garage builds up a

675
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,679
little bit of a mess it is all grow

676
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,400
waste and grow trash i wait till i've

677
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,559
got a nice pile then we do a dump run we

678
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,840
just take it all to the dump at one time

679
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,519
instead of doing just a bunch of small

680
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,519
runs you take it all at once but is it

681
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,879
time is it time for you to do a dump run

682
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,639
have you been building up a bunch of

683
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,440
stuff that big pile is going to

684
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,360
contribute to uh where bugs can hide if

685
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,798
you had a pest problem and you threw all

686
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,798
that [ __ ] out in the garage out in the

687
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,240
backyard the bugs are building there and

688
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,480
they're going to work their way back

689
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,200
into your grow eventually let's get rid

690
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,599
of all of that trash that old root ball

691
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,840
stuff those old sticks do you need to do

692
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,519
a dump run all right maybe it is time

693
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,439
for a dump run where are we on my list

694
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,440
of good stuff here

695
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,600
now we are to the part that should be

696
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,759
obvious to a lot of people but gets

697
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,719
often overlooked it is time to clean and

698
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,960
calibrate our ph meters those ph meters

699
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,720
need to be calibrated approximately once

700
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,798
a week it should have a check mark on it

701
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,000
that shows you that it is calibrated it

702
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,679
only takes a couple of minutes to

703
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,440
calibrate it especially once you get

704
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,038
good at it if you do it every week

705
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,720
you'll get out your seven solution and

706
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,319
your four solution and you'll be able to

707
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,759
go bloop bloop bloop and you'll get them

708
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,839
calibrated in just a couple of minutes

709
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,679
it won't take you time at all

710
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,959
one thing i do recommend

711
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,038
is having more than one calibration

712
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,279
standard available so if you've got the

713
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,519
four solution and the seven solution

714
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,678
maybe have another bottle of the seven

715
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,279
solution and test them to each other

716
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,200
after you take it out of the seven put

717
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,599
it in the other seven and see if they

718
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,279
both read seven that way you know that

719
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,119
one of your solutions isn't bad and you

720
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,319
are properly calibrated so it's time to

721
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,719
clean and calibrate your ph pin your ph

722
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,399
meter however cheap however expensive it

723
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,038
is now is a good time to clean it

724
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,960
remember if the ph meter dries it dies

725
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,119
so make sure you keep it moist keep it

726
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,880
clean it will work much better for a

727
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:39,359
much longer time also the ec pans your

728
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,039
condo electrical conductivity or your

729
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,199
tds meter whichever one you're using the

730
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,359
ppm ec uh there are a lot of meters you

731
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,759
can use clean that one also it'll work

732
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,119
much better and last much longer if you

733
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,079
clean it i don't think those need much

734
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:54,479
calibration but do clean

735
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,918
that how about nutrient inventory if it

736
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,240
is the first of the month that is a good

737
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,000
time to do a nutrient inventory shake

738
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,440
your bottles what are you low on do you

739
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,200
need to go buy some stuff do you need to

740
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,200
order some things do you need to restock

741
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,120
on stuff it is a really good time to

742
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,319
check and see what you might need look

743
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,439
through the rest of the month in your

744
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,558
grow schedule and say we're going to

745
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,640
feed this we're going to feed this we're

746
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,399
going to feed this do i have that stuff

747
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,679
so then when it comes time to mix in

748
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,679
your bloom booster you don't grab the

749
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
bottle and go oh i should have ordered

750
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,519
that a week ago let's order it now that

751
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,639
way we've got all of the stuff we need

752
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,839
throughout the grow and there are no

753
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,919
surprises no late [ __ ] products no

754
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,599
missing products in our reservoir we've

755
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,278
got everything we need let's just order

756
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,599
the [ __ ] right now if we're going to

757
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,919
order nutrients how about pesticide

758
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,639
inventory what pesticide products do you

759
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,559
use is it time to order more pesticides

760
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,919
i just say shake the bottles i just go

761
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,359
down and just shake the bottles and if

762
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,278
one feels light i write it down and

763
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,439
order another one it's that easy don't

764
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,359
let yourself run out of [ __ ] it's your

765
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,798
grow you're responsible for it you know

766
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,079
what you're gonna need you're the one

767
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,158
that's gonna order it you're the one

768
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,918
going to use it get that [ __ ] now make

769
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,400
it easy it's the first of the month

770
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,919
reinvest some of your last harvest back

771
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,120
into the next harvest try to make the

772
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,200
next grow better every single time so

773
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,199
what about other basic inventory what

774
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,679
are other things that i always need to

775
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,000
order for my grows gloves we are

776
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,519
constantly ordering gloves how many pair

777
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,440
of gloves do you go through a day in

778
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,879
your garden it's not a big math equation

779
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,960
think about how long you're in there how

780
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,640
many times you change gloves multiply

781
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,558
that by however many times a week you're

782
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,919
in the grow multiply that times four

783
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,359
that's a month that's how many pairs of

784
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,200
gloves you go through in a month how

785
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,959
many boxes do you need let's order them

786
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,558
now so we don't have to sit around and

787
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,798
wait for gloves to come when we do need

788
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,158
them it's really easy to order gloves a

789
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,839
lot of people like to wear a mask

790
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,679
especially the tremors let's order all

791
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,000
the masks

792
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,278
masks that's a fun word order all of the

793
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,119
[ __ ] that you think you need i don't

794
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,440
know what you need in your grow but

795
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,678
let's order it now i go through a lot of

796
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,240
clone plugs like a lot of rapid routers

797
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,840
i go through a lot of plant tags um just

798
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000
basic things that i know i'm going to

799
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,759
need i try to order that stuff on the

800
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,679
first that way it comes i have to make

801
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,000
one trip to the groce store or i get one

802
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,240
big box from amazon saves on shipping

803
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,159
saves on moving around just makes it so

804
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,839
much easier to do one big monthly order

805
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,440
all right now here's another thing we're

806
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,359
going to segue into that a lot of people

807
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,840
may have overlooked

808
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,678
let's double check our security what do

809
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,199
you have going on for your security the

810
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,400
first thing i recommend is just if

811
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,480
wherever you're growing whatever

812
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,880
building it is in if you're growing in a

813
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,360
in a room inside of a house let's just

814
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,039
check the security walk around outside

815
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,439
just see are there any light leaks do

816
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,879
you hear any fans do you smell anything

817
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,278
is there anything that would tip you off

818
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,679
that there is a grow inside of that room

819
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,319
or that building because if you can find

820
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,320
it that means that thieves that means it

821
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,079
snitches and that means that cops can

822
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,639
find that grow as well and we don't want

823
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:46,960
those folks finding our grows so be very

824
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,480
careful walk around see if you can see

825
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,319
any light leaking out of your grow do

826
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,400
you smell anything do you hear fans do

827
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,399
you hear any sort of air conditioning do

828
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,960
you hear [ __ ] cycling is it weird do you

829
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,480
feel vibrations from the blowers just go

830
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,480
check outside

831
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,759
if you're growing like in a big building

832
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,679
walk around the whole building if you're

833
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,440
growing in a room inside of a building

834
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,559
check that outside of that area and then

835
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,840
check like

836
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,599
if you're growing in the room adjacent

837
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,439
to this one sit in this room and see if

838
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,759
you hear a smell or see anything that

839
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,600
would alert you to a grow in the other

840
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,839
room just double check your security

841
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,918
then check your safety is that all

842
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,759
locked up is there a way for anybody to

843
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,200
get in there people often forget that

844
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,119
when you put an air conditioner in the

845
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,919
window all i gotta do is push that air

846
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,839
conditioner in and i'm in your grow it's

847
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,600
it's a hint that it's there and it's an

848
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,599
entryway so keep that [ __ ] in mind when

849
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,359
you're building your rooms don't give me

850
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,119
too many access points and give me too

851
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,119
many hints people are out there and

852
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,639
they're trying to get [ __ ] from you it's

853
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,558
a weird time right now and people are

854
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,520
going [ __ ] crazy for anything they

855
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:48,798
can get protect yourself so check your

856
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,720
security do you have security cameras do

857
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,960
you have security camera footage do you

858
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,798
have backups of your security camera

859
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,640
footage do you have all your cameras set

860
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,398
up the way that they need to be then

861
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,320
think about where all of that camera

862
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,119
footage is going is that saved somewhere

863
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,119
within your house is it on a dvr in your

864
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,119
house where that dvr could possibly be

865
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,639
stolen or is it backed up somewhere to

866
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,959
the internet to where it's stored in a

867
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,799
cloud and a server to where that footage

868
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,399
is always accessible and can't be taken

869
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,079
away from you another detail i would

870
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,239
think about is how long has it been

871
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,720
since you've changed your security codes

872
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,798
and passwords and who has keys if you've

873
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,240
got a facility with a gate maybe you had

874
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,398
to give keys to

875
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,640
an electrician maybe an hvac tech has a

876
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,319
key maybe an old employee has a key

877
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,880
think about where those keys are also

878
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,119
who has passcodes to your alarm system

879
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,520
who has passcodes to your cameras who

880
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,359
has any sort of passwords or codes to

881
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,519
anything think about that now may be the

882
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,839
time to do that thing where you log out

883
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,839
of all devices change your password and

884
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,918
log back in now may be the time to do

885
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,079
that sort of stuff especially if you had

886
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,480
any firing rehiring

887
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,960
any breakups any shifts

888
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,960
any riffs in the matrix now may be the

889
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,880
time to change passwords and do some

890
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,640
sort of security upgrades things like

891
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,039
that you never know what people are up

892
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,159
to especially now things are weird you

893
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,319
guys

894
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,799
so back up your security footage change

895
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:11,278
your security passwords and security

896
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,839
codes just because we don't know maybe

897
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,839
also change any locks that may need to

898
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,678
be changed now let's talk about some

899
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,879
other things you may need to think about

900
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,519
uh do you have msds

901
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,720
sheets msds sheets are very important in

902
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,038
my opinion uh if you were to uh get a

903
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,839
product in your eye or accidentally

904
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,119
think that the the ph down was kombucha

905
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,038
and you pick it up and take a drink of

906
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,398
it you got to go to the hospital they're

907
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,240
going to want to know all of the

908
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,599
information about all of the products

909
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,798
you may have exposed yourself or

910
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,119
consumed

911
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,278
have an msds sheet for all of your

912
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,000
products whenever in a commercial grow

913
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:50,240
we're required to have a folder of msds

914
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,679
sheets anytime we get a new product like

915
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,919
if this was a grow product this is just

916
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,759
a bottle of water but if this was a

917
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,360
nutrient as soon as it came into the

918
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,480
grow i would put it on the table and i

919
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,879
would go to the internet and i would

920
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,360
type in this product msds sheet and i

921
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,480
would print that msds sheet out and put

922
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,798
it in a folder and it would be

923
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,880
alphabetically in a folder that sits on

924
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,798
a desk with the pesticide logs and a few

925
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,159
other important logs in a commercial

926
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,398
grow we are required to have those

927
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,480
sheets for every product that is inside

928
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,239
of the facility in your personal grow it

929
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,480
would just be a good idea just in case

930
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,960
something does go wrong just to have

931
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,038
that product there that product msds

932
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,919
sheet there available for you the other

933
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,599
thing i would have is a spray log in

934
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,759
commercial environments we're required

935
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,839
to write down every pesticide

936
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,640
application we spray

937
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,720
we write down what room we sprayed what

938
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,399
products we sprayed how much of that

939
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,880
product was applied

940
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,479
we write down the epa number we write

941
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,960
down the number of the employee who

942
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,880
sprayed that they've got an epa number

943
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,798
and a training number as well

944
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,039
there are a lot of details that go along

945
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,759
with the spray products so i recommend a

946
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,200
spray log even in your personal grow

947
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,519
this will help you out for a couple of

948
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,120
reasons if i don't want you to get sick

949
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,240
i don't want you to spray pesticides in

950
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,398
your eyes i don't want you to get any

951
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,120
sort of rash but if you do and you've

952
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,038
got that pesticide log and the msds

953
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,398
sheet you've got some hints some clues

954
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,480
if we've got to take you to the hospital

955
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,479
because you're in anaphylactic shock

956
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,880
those two things may help me out to

957
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,519
figure out how to save your life so the

958
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,480
msds sheet and the spray log i think are

959
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,720
very important even in a personal grow

960
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,399
just consider those msds sheets and

961
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,839
those spray logs as part of the notes

962
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:29,599
that you should be taking anyway you

963
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,918
should be taking copious notes with your

964
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,839
grow you should be making a nice journal

965
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,600
if things go right you're going to want

966
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,278
to be able to repeat that process and if

967
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,879
you've got good notes then you know

968
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,558
exactly what you did and you can repeat

969
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,919
it if you just guess you're just

970
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,319
guessing who knows if we're going to get

971
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,919
it right again next time it's not like

972
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,359
grandma's cake recipe or grandma's

973
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,480
breakfast recipe you can't just guess

974
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,240
and throw some of this [ __ ] in there it

975
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,720
might work but it's not going to be the

976
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,558
same every single time if you have notes

977
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,319
if you've got documentation we can

978
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,240
repeat the process and in a commercial

979
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,480
environment that's what's required is a

980
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,558
repeatable provable process with

981
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,558
quantifiable results

982
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,519
now let me move forward here's another

983
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,119
thing that

984
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,880
most growers may not think about but

985
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,158
once you get a little bit more advanced

986
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,600
maybe i think about it because i'm a

987
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,840
business owner and i work in big

988
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,158
commercial industry grows how about an

989
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,558
expense report how much are you spending

990
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,080
on your grow are you documenting your

991
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,240
monthly electrical bill are you

992
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,839
documenting your monthly water bill are

993
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,919
you documenting how much you spend on

994
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,480
nutrients are you documenting how much

995
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,240
you spent on soil are you documenting

996
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,640
how much you spent on the equipment and

997
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,399
setting up the grow are you considering

998
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,320
your time and energy are you paying

999
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,158
yourself are you documenting how many

1000
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,398
hours a week or a month you spend in

1001
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,559
that grow space let's just start writing

1002
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,158
down an expense report how much are we

1003
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,639
spending how much time are we putting

1004
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,720
into this then let's also keep good

1005
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,120
notes on the harvest reports write down

1006
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,960
every gram you harvest anything that you

1007
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,359
pull out of there let's document that as

1008
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,278
well then over time you'll have a couple

1009
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,879
of quantifiable reports you can see what

1010
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,558
you're spending you can see if you're

1011
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,840
spending more or less than when you

1012
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,678
started and you can see if you're

1013
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,439
pulling more or less product than when

1014
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,200
you started and you can see if you are

1015
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,440
improving or if you're getting worse

1016
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,360
maybe then you can find areas to improve

1017
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,798
once you start taking notes you start

1018
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,798
seeing like oh i could have done this

1019
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,158
better could have done this better last

1020
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,918
time we did this and we didn't get as

1021
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,919
much herb this time we did this we got

1022
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,320
more you can start seeing those things

1023
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,240
so start taking copious notes i really

1024
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,000
think that having a journal and taking a

1025
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,240
lot of notes is really important then

1026
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,319
when you see that cost and expense sheet

1027
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,359
then you really see like oh i used to

1028
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,359
spend

1029
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,278
300 bucks i don't i'm just guessing how

1030
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,599
much a week or a month you might spend i

1031
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,000
used to spend 300 bucks a month on herb

1032
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,079
and since i spent 1200 bucks on building

1033
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,759
that grow that means that if i spend if

1034
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,199
i make enough herb for four months worth

1035
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:46,960
of herb that i've paid off all my

1036
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,640
equipment everything after that i'm just

1037
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,720
kind of paying for electricity and water

1038
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,320
and my energy then you know like i've

1039
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,720
paid off the equipment now maybe i can

1040
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,319
upgrade to a new light it really will

1041
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,000
help you out once you start seeing like

1042
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,759
what you're putting in and what you're

1043
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,599
getting out of it you'll want to improve

1044
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,759
at that rate so i really think that the

1045
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,599
expense report is just part of the basic

1046
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,759
grow journaling if you're taking a lot

1047
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,838
of details and taking notes that expense

1048
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,119
report will fall right in line with the

1049
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,639
rest of your notes maybe it's just

1050
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,800
another page maybe it's another part of

1051
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,159
the spreadsheet however you're doing it

1052
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,720
i think once you get comfortable and

1053
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,119
used to it it'll just be another part of

1054
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,959
the documentation which you are keeping

1055
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,399
another thing that i think is important

1056
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,398
is to have goals and plans if you've got

1057
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,799
that expense sheet it will help you set

1058
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,078
goals and it will help you make plans

1059
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,519
how do you know you're reaching any

1060
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,519
goals how do you know you're successful

1061
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,358
if you never wrote down any goals and

1062
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,519
made any plans we all want to grow some

1063
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,598
weed right if you get a harvest that's

1064
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,199
cool that's success but how do you know

1065
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,960
that the next harvest is better how do

1066
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,559
you know that the next one is better

1067
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,199
let's have some goals let's have some

1068
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,440
plans write down a schedule i'm going to

1069
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,439
plant this many seeds at this day i'm

1070
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,960
going to put them into small pots this

1071
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,760
day then they're going to go into bigger

1072
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,000
pots this day i intend to flower on this

1073
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,680
day leave yourself some openings some

1074
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,119
windows like maybe the plants don't grow

1075
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,598
as fast as you need it or maybe they

1076
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,680
grow faster but try to have an idea a

1077
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,599
schedule i've been growing so long that

1078
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,799
when we go to a commercial grow i can

1079
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,960
look at the height i can look at the

1080
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,200
space and i can say here is the schedule

1081
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,199
we're going to need nine weeks of flower

1082
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,039
that means it nine weeks in the flower

1083
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,879
room that's undeniable that's what we

1084
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,880
need so they've gotta flower nine weeks

1085
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,640
in here how big can i get them uh by the

1086
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,480
time they're done how big do i have to

1087
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,239
get them in here before i flower them to

1088
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,240
max them out at their maximum height in

1089
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,078
this room before we're done that tells

1090
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,159
me how many weeks we can veg so i just

1091
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,079
automatically start thinking uh two

1092
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,319
weeks in the cloner two weeks in small

1093
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,680
pots three weeks in big pots then we

1094
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,359
move them into the flower room it'll

1095
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,279
work perfectly i just start scheduling i

1096
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,199
make a plan and then we stick to those

1097
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,800
plans and schedules and create routines

1098
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,358
and rhythms and standard operating

1099
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,680
procedures the way to do that is to have

1100
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,679
some goals and have some plans and if

1101
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,519
you're working with multiple people it

1102
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,279
is really important to get all of those

1103
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,559
people on the same plan make sure

1104
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,640
everybody knows

1105
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,639
the goal and make sure everybody knows

1106
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,000
they're part of the puzzle to reach that

1107
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,920
goal if everybody thinks they're a

1108
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,199
trimmer nobody's going to water plants

1109
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,280
if everybody thinks they're watering

1110
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,759
plants nobody's going to defoliate make

1111
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,519
sure everybody knows their role the

1112
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,800
easiest way to do that is to find

1113
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,639
somebody that can be the leader that

1114
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,400
knows everything that needs to be done

1115
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,559
they can delegate all of the jobs for

1116
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,119
the day so have some goals have some

1117
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,440
plans create objectives have an expense

1118
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,358
sheet but most importantly in that grow

1119
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,119
have a bunch of fun i know i just gave

1120
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,719
you a bunch of tasks a bunch of

1121
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,880
assignments a bunch of [ __ ] to think

1122
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,959
about but most importantly go in there

1123
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,039
and have fun but it's i think it's

1124
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,480
easier to have fun when we set ourselves

1125
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,159
up for success and that's what i'm

1126
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,760
trying to help you do here is set

1127
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,838
yourself up for success if you go in

1128
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,320
that grow and all of the equipment works

1129
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:48,159
smoothly everything just runs you push

1130
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,838
that button and all the processes happen

1131
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,598
and the plants go shebang you'll be

1132
