16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,480
if that's actually a cross it is labeled

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,210

18
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,069

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,109
delicious concentrate it kind of gives

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,030
you that mind eraser sort of a thing you

21
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,000
go blank for a few minutes it got mike

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,679
ridiculously high earlier today there is

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,820
a lab test printed on the container

24
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:59,100
it says THC a nine hundred and 2.9

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,590
milligrams which equals ninety point

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,570
three percent the THC is twenty-one

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,790
point four three milligrams which equals

28
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,280
two point one percent and there are no

29
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,560
other cannabinoids detected the Durbin

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,900
Kush sauce from contraband concentrates

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,180
it's got me lit up I really like this

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,930
energetic talkative buzz this should be

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,270
a fun podcast this episode will be the

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,040
second in a series of grow lessons it

35
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:25,048
will take us from the beginning of the

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,030
grow all the way up to harvest and

37
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,770
drying and curing our product in the

38
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,570
last episode we talked a little bit

39
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:32,280
about planning our grow and setting

40
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:34,679
goals and finding ways to stay out of

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,590
trouble in this episode we're going to

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,770
focus more on planning the specific grow

43
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,930
space I've got a lot of details written

44
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:44,879
down for this episode so I'm gonna press

45
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,890
pause I'm gonna take a quick drink of

46
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,228
course I'm gonna take a bunch more dad

47
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,509
and when I come back we'll take a deep

48
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,109
dive into selecting and planning your

49
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,109
grow space

50
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,899
all right podcast roll I am back and I

51
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:08,449
am ready to talk about selecting your

52
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,640
gross space let's get right into it

53
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,280
you can set up a grow almost anywhere if

54
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,279
you can supply electricity air flow and

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,620
water to that space where you choose to

56
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,209
grow is going to determine a lot of your

57
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,099
setup we talked about this in the last

58
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:24,289
episode if you're in a small closet

59
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,750
you'll be very limited but you'll still

60
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:28,519
be able to produce a usable product if

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,889
you're in a prohibition state you'll

62
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,349
need to take extra precautions to keep

63
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:35,809
the aroma down and also you'll need an

64
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:38,840
excuse for the extra electrical

65
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,670
consumption let me make a quick

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,099
disclaimer that I cannot endorse

67
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:45,500
encourage or promote you to conduct any

68
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,599
sort of illegal activity you've got to

69
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,239
follow the laws and obey all of the

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,489
rules if you didn't listen to the last

71
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,159
episode please go back and listen to

72
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,750
that long passionate rant I gave about

73
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,000
what will happen to you if you were

74
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,549
suspected of having an illegal grow in

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,530
your home now let's keep going I

76
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,359
recommend everyone do your best to

77
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,959
minimize odor and obvious signs of a

78
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:10,670
grow even in legal environments thieves

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,890
know how to spot a grow and you're

80
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:15,798
entering a gray area that until recently

81
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,958
has been run by criminals you're

82
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,359
planning to produce a high-value product

83
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,009
and people want that product if you tell

84
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:25,010
somebody about that product you are

85
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:27,229
asking for trouble so be careful in the

86
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:30,289
last episode I talked about not bragging

87
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:31,099
keep yourself protected by keeping your

88
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:34,310
mouth shut

89
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:36,949
now let's talk more about places to grow

90
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,930
we can grow in closets we can grow in

91
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:41,238
pre-made tents we can grow in bedrooms

92
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,370
we can set up giant areas in basements

93
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,810
and we can even use tiny spaces like our

94
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,250
friends love for the plant and love for

95
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,439
the bond they grow in little micro

96
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,079
growths the size of your space and the

97
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,719
pre-existing structure will dictate most

98
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:56,629
of your setup especially in a rental

99
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:58,939
home and even more so in a prohibition

100
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:00,469
environment if you own your home or if

101
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,030
you're busting out the barn or if you're

102
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:06,169
building out a warehouse and a legal

103
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,479
area you have much more options ideal

104
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,458
spaces for a grow are generally places

105
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,959
with low traffic and something you can

106
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,599
keep hidden from visitor

107
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,790
I like basements for home grows attics

108
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,920
are okay but they're harder to keep the

109
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,080
climate dialed in the Sun is beating

110
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,330
right on top of your gross space and the

111
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,669
home heat rises so attics are generally

112
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,019
warmer places maybe my East Coast

113
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,420
friends would have better luck in the

114
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:31,639
Attic while the Colorado crew will get

115
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,740
down in the basement better basements

116
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,500
are usually insulated by the earth so

117
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,870
the temperature stays fairly cool if you

118
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,029
can isolate a small section or a room in

119
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,430
the basement that is usually my first

120
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:45,649
choice people won't be down in your

121
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,990
basement unless you invite them so it's

122
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:50,299
easier to keep it secure now the only

123
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,009
issue with basements is when you have to

124
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,689
have a contractor come fix the water

125
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:56,360
heater or the heater or some sort of

126
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:59,300
plumbing down there you may need to be

127
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,210
prepared for visitors so basements and

128
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,340
attics are ideal in my opinion spare

129
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:05,839
bedrooms are great if you have good

130
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:07,639
control of your home if you live with

131
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,709
other people you have to make sure that

132
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,930
everyone is on the same page with the

133
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:14,719
importance of security and light control

134
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,250
in your grow rooms if you live with

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,990
other people and you've got a grow room

136
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,339
and a spare bedroom there's a good

137
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,168
chance that when you're gone when you're

138
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:22,549
on a date when you're asleep they're

139
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:24,168
gonna take somebody in there and show

140
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,280
off your grow and they're gonna do

141
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:26,959
something weird they're gonna turn on

142
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,879
the light during the night cycle they're

143
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,739
gonna leave that the overhead light on

144
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,149
and not think about the light the normal

145
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,100
room light when the grow lights go off

146
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:36,049
that normal light will stay on they're

147
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,720
gonna screw it up so have everybody in

148
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,449
the house on the same page if you set up

149
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,790
a grow in a shared home in a shared room

150
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,759
with other folks so be careful with that

151
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,640
sort of stuff another thing to think

152
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,649
about is keeping children out of the

153
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,300
grow without supervision if you let your

154
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,620
kids help that's up to you as a parent

155
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,270
that's up to you as a caregiver maybe

156
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,220
you're growing for the child I think if

157
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:59,599
you're growing for a child it's great to

158
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,919
have that child go in there and help

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
with their medicine they can build a

160
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:03,829
relationship with it I think that is a

161
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,629
beautiful thing

162
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:07,659
that's up to you as a parent you parent

163
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:10,459
the way you feel you should do it but

164
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,140
keep the grow room locked and keep the

165
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:14,449
kids out without supervision I'd

166
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,699
recommend a lock anyway just to make law

167
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,949
enforcement happy if anyone does come to

168
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,300
inspect your legal grow a lock just

169
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:23,360
makes you look like you're trying to be

170
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,079
more responsible it looks good it's an

171
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,379
easy step to take do

172
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:31,198
that garages and outbuildings are also

173
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:33,419
great places for grows any space in

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,520
which you can control the lights the

175
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:37,799
temperature and humidity you can turn

176
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,378
into a grow if you have a large space

177
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,449
and you can't control the large area you

178
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,060
can buy a grow tent of almost any size

179
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,699
and set that up in a room to create a

180
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,500
more controllable environment you can

181
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,228
also set up multiple tents to have

182
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,019
multiple cycles in the same basement or

183
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:57,360
room area you can have a veg area and

184
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,728
two tents with alternating flower cycles

185
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,530
to maximize the productivity of a

186
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:03,870
basement grow it's all about

187
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:06,899
maximization once you get your rooms

188
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,689
dialed in you can maximize a closet or a

189
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:12,750
cabinet or a warehouse if you set it up

190
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:15,389
correctly be sure to keep safety and

191
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,149
security in mind is your new grow option

192
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:20,129
safe is it secure and once again can you

193
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:22,468
handle the consequences if you get

194
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:26,250
yourself into trouble think about that

195
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:27,810
now before we jump in no matter where

196
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,939
you set up your drone there are a few

197
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,829
things to keep in mind the thing I feel

198
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,759
is most commonly overlooked is the

199
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:37,889
importance of air flow and air exchange

200
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,080
we need to exchange the air in a grow

201
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:42,300
room imagine if I stuck you in a closet

202
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,269
for 24 hours and I didn't open the door

203
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,028
for any fresh air or to let out any of

204
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:49,588
the gases they came from you you'd be

205
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:50,908
alive and you'd be a little

206
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:52,918
uncomfortable on the air in that room

207
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:54,899
would be so stale and funky that you

208
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,508
just couldn't wait to get out you'd be

209
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:00,149
ready for some fresh air the plants feel

210
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,788
the same way plants uptake co2 and

211
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:05,338
release oxygen so we have to think about

212
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:07,500
where we're getting fresh co2 from and

213
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:09,629
as the plants function they release

214
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,389
water vapor that increases the relative

215
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:14,849
humidity of our grow space so we have to

216
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:18,449
have a plan to get rid of that excess

217
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:20,218
humidity now as we remove the old air we

218
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:22,830
need to replace it with fresh air in

219
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:24,778
most small grows you'll be able to

220
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:26,338
replace the air probably with just the

221
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:28,199
airflow that flows from underneath the

222
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:30,149
door if you've got a closet grow or a

223
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,129
very small bedroom grow you'll get

224
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:34,078
enough air coming in through passive

225
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,448
vents like underneath the door most of

226
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:39,000
your grow tents will have passive vents

227
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:41,370
built into the bottom utilize those

228
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,799
if you're using a powerful enough blower

229
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,080
to extract the warm human air from the

230
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:49,199
top of a grow space you may need to add

231
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,470
a passive intake to allow enough fresh

232
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,259
air to flow into your space so the major

233
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:58,500
consideration is airflow can you get air

234
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,110
in and out of your grow space now don't

235
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,090
plan on leaving the door open as part of

236
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,129
your plan because what about the dark

237
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,500
cycle you can't leave the door open

238
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:09,750
during the dark cycle and also what

239
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,190
about those days when you're not home or

240
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,590
what about that night when you get too

241
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,930
stoned and fall asleep and forget don't

242
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:19,019
rely on just leaving the door open as

243
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:21,839
part of your HVAC plan that is not going

244
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,149
to work that is not sufficient set

245
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,519
yourself up for success give your garden

246
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,529
a chance and it will be so much more

247
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,509
enjoyable don't make it stressful make

248
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,250
it something you enjoy starting off with

249
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:33,569
a shitty plan like trying to remember to

250
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,809
close the door every night at 9:30

251
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,860
that's gonna frustrate you in two weeks

252
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,449
all right so I've stressed the

253
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,460
importance of airflow let's move forward

254
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,520
and talk about electricity and power

255
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,009
consumption can you safely provide

256
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,429
electricity to your grow area without

257
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:52,500
causing a fire hazard don't be that guy

258
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:54,838
that burned down your house with a

259
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,580
poorly designed to grow that makes the

260
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,400
whole grove movement look bad and sets

261
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,240
us all back five years so please be

262
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,909
careful can you power a grow light a fan

263
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,409
an exhaust fan maybe an air conditioner

264
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:10,289
and whatever else you need for the gross

265
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:12,779
space you choose don't pull too many

266
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:15,299
amps from one breaker for too long

267
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:19,409
because eventually something will melt

268
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:21,659
and you will have a fire if you flip a

269
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:24,419
breaker more than two times a day it is

270
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:27,750
time to reconsider your electrical plan

271
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:30,750
also be prepared to pay for your

272
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,059
electrical use you won't have a crop for

273
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,100
a few months but you're going to have

274
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:38,009
lights to pay for at the end of the

275
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,470
first month so be prepared for that bill

276
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:43,769
that's something a lot of young and new

277
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,810
growers forget to plan ahead for you

278
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,819
hang up your grow light you plug it in

279
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:50,250
you get [ __ ] run and you think yeah and

280
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,209
like 90 to 120 days I'm gonna harvest

281
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,058
and have a bunch of money and then

282
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:57,368
about 35 days the bill comes and you go

283
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:58,868
oh [ __ ] I gotta pay a hundred extra

284
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:00,759
dollars because I'm running this grow

285
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:03,189
light and I didn't consider that plan

286
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,800
ahead there's a bill coming every month

287
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:07,688
now you've got a new bill to pay for

288
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:10,208
that grow keep that in mind

289
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:13,599
also if you are going to pull a lot of

290
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:15,698
extra electricity have a plan to tell

291
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,350
the electric company why you need an

292
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:22,419
excuse they may ask sometimes they call

293
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,428
sometimes they send a letter sometimes

294
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:27,938
they show up and walk around the house

295
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:31,240
to check for inefficiencies be very

296
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:33,990
careful also law enforcement can use

297
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,549
your electric bill as probable cause

298
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,860
with the new smart meters they can

299
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:41,409
probably tell exactly how many kilowatts

300
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,028
you're using and exactly which point of

301
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:46,028
the day so they can probably tell that

302
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:48,490
at 9 a.m. you start pulling 4000 watts

303
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:50,350
worth of extra power until 9 p.m. and

304
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,389
then it turns off they probably know

305
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,909
when you're in Flour they probably know

306
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,649
when you're in veg keep that sort of

307
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:58,868
stuff in mind when you're building and

308
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,548
designing your grow and also when you're

309
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:02,139
selecting your lights and equipment and

310
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:04,720
we'll talk about choosing lighting in a

311
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:07,209
future episode now the next thing we

312
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,639
should consider is water can you get

313
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:11,888
water to your grow area as your grow

314
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,409
space in the Attic how are you going to

315
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:16,329
get water to your attic are you gonna

316
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:18,188
fill up five gallon water bottles and

317
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:19,958
hook them up this that ladder or are you

318
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:21,938
gonna run a hose up there and hope you

319
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:25,359
don't have a catastrophe with that be

320
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:27,490
very careful either way please what if

321
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,558
your grows in the basement is there a

322
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,899
tap down there in the basement do you

323
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:33,249
have access to water think about where

324
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,649
your water is coming from

325
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:37,808
also think about runoff water you'll

326
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,360
need to dispose of water occasionally

327
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:43,719
especially if you're running a hydro

328
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,480
system does your basement have a floor

329
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,220
drain if it's got a floor drain give it

330
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,199
a test before you go pouring a whole

331
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,678
bunch of water down there pour a half a

332
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:53,078
gallon

333
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:56,528
see what happens it doesn't clog up pour

334
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:58,448
a gallon pour to be patient because

335
00:12:56,528 --> 00:13:00,278
sometimes those floor drains they're

336
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,568
backed up way down the line and you got

337
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,668
to pour a bunch of water in there and

338
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:04,990
then suddenly it overflows into your

339
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:05,539
floor don't think you're gonna pour a

340
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,769
big

341
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:08,208
reservoir down there don't think you're

342
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,698
gonna drain your hydro gear down there

343
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:13,369
be very careful test that floor drain

344
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:15,439
before you rely on it too much you may

345
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,078
also need to think about extra water

346
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,820
consumption depends on how big your grow

347
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,189
is it depends on how much they're paying

348
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,990
attention it depends on if you pay the

349
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,269
water bill or if the landlord pays the

350
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,818
water bill this just may be something to

351
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:31,339
consider since we're talking about water

352
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:32,990
I'm gonna mention get a good shot back

353
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:35,480
now you're gonna have to get water to

354
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,899
your grow on a daily basis I use about

355
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,970
five gallons of water per light per day

356
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:43,519
maybe every other day when the plants

357
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,930
are smaller think about how much water

358
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,720
you're going to need while you're

359
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:49,818
planning your gross space do you really

360
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,740
think you want to Huck a five gallon

361
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:54,229
container of water up that attic ladder

362
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,959
for nine weeks if you're not a medical

363
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:00,440
marijuana patient now you will be by the

364
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:02,208
end of that grow cycle another thing we

365
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,000
really need to think about when planning

366
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:07,698
our grow space is darkness and light

367
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
control can you make your space

368
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:13,250
completely dark during your dark cycle I

369
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,958
don't mean dark to where it's kind of

370
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,778
dark I don't mean dark where there's a

371
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:22,369
little bit of light I mean dark to where

372
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:24,350
it is scary dark I mean zero light lay

373
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,659
in your grow space for five or ten

374
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,000
minutes with your eyes open and let your

375
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,740
eyes adjust to that total darkness then

376
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,169
wave your hand in front of your face if

377
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,389
you can see your hand at all it is too

378
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:37,759
light in there we need absolute total

379
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:41,299
darkness any light will potentially

380
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,549
cause your plants to have issues if your

381
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:45,740
plants have light during their suppose

382
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,389
at night cycle they might not even begin

383
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,278
to flower you may think you're in flower

384
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,870
and you're still vegging they may be

385
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,159
getting just enough light to where

386
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,629
they're kind of flowering but they're

387
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,129
still kind of edging and they're looking

388
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:56,480
really weird and they start taking on

389
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:58,938
weird shapes and their leaves get

390
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,459
strange you could have that or if you've

391
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:03,318
got a very small light leak the area

392
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,268
that is getting hit by that light will

393
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:07,188
make hermaphrodite flowers and that will

394
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:08,750
pollinate little sections of the room

395
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:12,610
and you'll have little seeds in your

396
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:15,860
buds so we need an area that we can keep

397
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,480
absolutely dark during our dark cycle

398
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,460
something that won't get interrupted by

399
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,930
somebody needing to use the bath

400
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,480
something that won't get interrupted by

401
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:24,889
somebody needing to do laundry something

402
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,720
that won't get interrupted by somebody

403
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:28,789
going out to the garage to do something

404
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,820
think ahead of all of the reasons

405
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:33,409
somebody may need to go in your grow

406
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,750
area that's why I like a little grow

407
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:37,669
tent or an isolated room or the back

408
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,850
corner of the basement where nobody ever

409
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:43,490
goes so those are the major things to

410
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,889
think about when building your grow and

411
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,289
selecting your grow space you want

412
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:50,449
somewhere discreet and secure you need

413
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:54,289
to be able to control temperature and

414
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:57,528
humidity within a very tight range we

415
00:15:54,289 --> 00:16:00,919
want to get about 77 degrees with about

416
00:15:57,528 --> 00:16:03,289
40% humidity in our flower rooms you

417
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,849
want to be able to dial that in you need

418
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:07,730
some more with adequate power and

419
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:11,629
available water you also may need an

420
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,550
excuse for the extra consumption another

421
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:15,799
very important factor we keep talking

422
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:18,199
about is light control we can't have

423
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:21,109
light interruptions in our grow we need

424
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,180
to keep our light scheduled perfectly

425
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,950
the dark cycle is super critical during

426
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:26,870
flowering you guys it cannot be

427
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,990
interrupted by the tiniest amount of

428
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,549
light I can't stress that enough like I

429
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,230
said earlier grow tints work great

430
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:35,208
because somebody can't walk into the

431
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,170
room and flip on the switch for the

432
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,629
light that's in the room and

433
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:40,789
accidentally get light in that grow tent

434
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:43,009
if you've got it closed up properly

435
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:44,449
don't leave it open for air flow like I

436
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:46,490
talked about leaving the grow room door

437
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,040
open earlier don't leave your grow tent

438
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,409
open and get too stoned or get way too

439
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,819
into a game of fork knife and totally

440
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:54,679
forget that those lights went off at

441
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,839
7:00 and you left that room open and now

442
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,189
it's 8:30 and you're freaking out don't

443
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,200
let that [ __ ] happen as long as you

444
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,380
close the grow tent you should be safe

445
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:06,049
from light interruptions I feel like I

446
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,910
covered a lot of the basics of selecting

447
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:10,068
your grow space think about your needs

448
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,769
and your goals and try to find a space

449
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:14,688
that works the best for you as long as

450
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:17,599
you can provide the essentials you can

451
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:19,429
make any space work I've grown in that

452
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,948
little mini closet underneath the stairs

453
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:25,069
in an apartment I've grown in a sketchy

454
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:27,410
attic in a garage in Kansas I've grown

455
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:29,149
in a spare bedroom in bessemer and I've

456
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,308
busted out basements with somewhere

457
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,059
between two and twelve lights depending

458
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:35,220
on the basement

459
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:38,249
also grown in giant warehouses and I've

460
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,929
done a lot of growing and grow tents the

461
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:42,058
needs are the same in all of those

462
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:44,370
spaces and a little planning and thought

463
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:47,638
can make your tiny space produce the

464
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:48,989
same quality as commercial grows if done

465
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:52,048
wisely

466
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,990
don't let anybody talk down to you for

467
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:56,878
growing in a grow tent set your finished

468
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,519
product next to their finished product

469
00:17:56,878 --> 00:18:02,009
and ask them if it was grown in a big

470
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,659
room in a warehouse or in a tent it

471
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:05,819
doesn't matter as long as you were

472
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:08,730
producing a product that makes you happy

473
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,349
and meets your demands that's the

474
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,639
important part don't let anybody talk

475
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,648
[ __ ] to you about the way you grow like

476
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:16,498
we said last time you're only doing it

477
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:18,449
wrong if the plants die now let's move

478
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:20,788
forward a little bit something I want to

479
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,460
mention is cleanliness if you set up in

480
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:25,618
a basement or a spare room try to get

481
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,038
anything not grow related out of that

482
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:31,319
space I would recommend a solid cleaning

483
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,658
of any space before setting up and if

484
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,888
the space has a funky dingy smell like

485
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:38,070
if you're in a basement it's got that

486
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:39,990
basement smell try to find the cause of

487
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:42,329
that what's down there making it funky

488
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,220
can you get rid of it and then maybe get

489
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,898
a bunch of fresher through that space

490
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,909
for a little while before you set up

491
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:48,388
maybe open some windows get some fans

492
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,730
going

493
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:54,118
spray some ozium in there just try to

494
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:56,190
get rid of that funky smell because that

495
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:58,230
smell could stick to your buds you don't

496
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,028
want to grow in a funky space and then

497
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,069
you don't want your product to end up

498
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:04,618
smelling like funky basement and it will

499
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:06,960
if your space has that funk especially

500
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:09,240
if you're going to dry and cure in a

501
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,740
funky basement so try to get rid of that

502
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,288
funky basement smell you can do that

503
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,878
just by getting air into the room get a

504
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:16,798
little air flow go and get that old

505
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:19,259
funky air out of there that'll really

506
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:22,349
help you out earlier I said to clean the

507
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:24,899
room everything in a room is a spot for

508
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:27,240
a spider mite or a pest to hang out and

509
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:28,768
hide every little spot if you got some

510
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,269
clothes in there that's a beautiful spot

511
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,339
for a bunch of bugs just to hang out

512
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,470
just try to clean up the space and have

513
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:36,240
a nice tidy gross space it'll help you

514
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,639
keep everything organized and it will

515
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,460
help you keep bugs away so find a good

516
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:44,069
space make sure it's safe make sure you

517
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,650
can get a lot of airflow to the area

518
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:48,480
make sure you can get water to the area

519
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,570
if you're going to provide supplemental

520
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,029
co2 to your grow space make sure you can

521
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:57,509
carry co2 tanks to the area those tanks

522
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:59,519
are heavy make sure that you can control

523
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:02,099
the lights in your grow space and also

524
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,470
the darkness in your grow space and be

525
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:07,649
sure that you can control the flow of

526
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,180
human traffic in your grow area also you

527
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,980
don't want your pets down there I do not

528
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,420
encourage people taking their animals to

529
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,160
the grow I see it a lot if you want your

530
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,350
pet in the grow that's on you I do not

531
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,269
encourage it they go play in the yard

532
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:20,039
they're picking up pests probably from

533
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:21,089
every plant in the yard they're bringing

534
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,609
it right into your girl I don't

535
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:25,529
encourage that but you do what makes you

536
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:28,619
happy like I said you're only doing it

537
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:30,059
wrong when the plants die so the next

538
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:32,639
step is to make sure this is something

539
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:35,250
you want to do and then we will talk

540
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,759

541
