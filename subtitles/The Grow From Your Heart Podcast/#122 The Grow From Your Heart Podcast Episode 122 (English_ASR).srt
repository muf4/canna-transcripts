appreciate it all so let's get into the

47
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:50,629
big topic that's been going on here in

48
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,000
Pueblo Colorado the cannabis cup was

49
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:55,129
supposed to be in Denver on 4/20

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,599
supposed to supposed to but

51
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:58,250
unfortunately the city of Denver

52
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,728
declined all the permits I'm not sure

53
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,500
exactly

54
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:04,728
Denver officials declined all the

55
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,739
permits they were County I believe well

56
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:09,368
either way they said nope not gonna do

57
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:11,568
it nope they had some issues namely

58
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:14,479
out-of-state dispensaries handing out

59
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:15,669
samples and what was supposed to be

60
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,408
14,000

61
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:22,639
actually being 35,000 people a day

62
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:24,289
alright well anyway they said no I would

63
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,000
follow this one close High Times came

64
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,289
down to Pueblo Colorado where Mike and I

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,269
reside yes

66
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:32,929
they claimed we they were going to do

67
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:34,849
the festival on the 18th 19th 20th 21st

68
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,010
within that range those original goal

69
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:38,359
they put up flyers they put out some

70
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:40,128
announcements on their website they put

71
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,829
out some stuff on Twitter Instagram and

72
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:44,298
Facebook and then suddenly they

73
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,540
retracted all their statements and said

74
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:50,120
oh [ __ ] the next weekend so the permits

75
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:52,159
have been entered they've been submitted

76
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,659
they're being reviewed so far the city

77
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,689
of Pueblo has not said if they are going

78
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:58,789
to allow or decline the cannabis cup to

79
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:00,408
happen in Pueblo Colorado this episode

80
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,000
will come out in two or three days and

81
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:04,459
I'm pretty sure the decision will not be

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,500
made at that time so right now there is

83
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,109
no definite location for the High Times

84
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,519
Cannabis Cup in Colorado and it if it

85
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:14,239
does happen it will be moved to the

86
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,329
weekend of the 22nd and the 23rd if it

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,430
does happen in Pueblo Colorado at all

88
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:22,370
yeah I read something today claiming

89
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:26,030
that this move was it was sort of an

90
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,709
option B if Adams County didn't go

91
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,930
through and they've been looking for

92
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,319
bigger locations than the Denver Mart

93
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,659
and the location down here in public

94
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,939
claims to be able to handle the 25 or 30

95
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:39,378
thousand people a day no problem so I'm

96
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,848
not too familiar with the location I

97
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:42,048
thought Denver Mart was great but of

98
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:44,268
course when I heard that it was going to

99
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:47,540
be in Pueblo I was excited that's so

100
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:49,579
awesome that shaves a lot a huge chunk

101
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:51,769
of money out of going to the cup first I

102
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:53,060
really just want to go to the cup yeah

103
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:54,439
you got to go up you gotta get a hotel

104
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,659
room you don't want to be driving back

105
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,359
home to Pueblo after the cup

106
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,829
and it's a multiple day event I have to

107
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:02,359
go to every day just because that's how

108
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:03,980
I write if you're trying to go to all

109
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,379
three days or have to do it all three

110
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,268
days you got to be up there for you know

111
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:09,348
paying top dollar for hotel rooms right

112
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,389
now and Denver sucks

113
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:12,858
and every all of the shitty hotels go

114
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:15,319
expensive if you think you're gonna pay

115
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:17,750
70 or 80 for a hotel those 70 and 80

116
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:21,589
dollar hotels are now 130 on cannabis

117
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,300
cup weekend yep Denver knows that 420 is

118
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,908
a big weekend in Denver and they cash

119
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,468
the [ __ ] unfortunately a bunch of people

120
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:28,490
have already booked plane tickets they

121
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:31,098
have booked the rooms

122
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,990
yeah the big complaint about the Cup in

123
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:35,899
Denver was always that the planning was

124
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,879
sort of like a d-minus like the roof

125
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:39,709
didn't fall in like nobody got squashed

126
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,418
but other than that it was kind of a

127
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:42,918
[ __ ] well when they changed their

128
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:44,240
mind that they weren't going to do it in

129
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,740
Denver and they decided to move it to

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,288
Pueblo a lot of people were like yeah

131
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,360
[ __ ] Pueblo fumbles got an interesting

132
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,279
reputation out there yeah we sure do we

133
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,139
sure do but then when they push the date

134
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,119
to a completely different weekend I'm

135
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,590
sure that a large portion of the people

136
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,720
that we're going to attend just decided

137
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,060
[ __ ] it they weren't even gonna try if

138
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,470
the cup goes off in Pueblo because it's

139
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,319
not at all a sure thing at this point

140
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,199
folks it's the decision comes down to

141
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:13,220
the County Planning Department and then

142
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,439
if they decide yes it can be appealed by

143
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,810
any number of people and our local

144
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,959
sheriff has told the press that if it's

145
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,180
approved he's going to appeal um because

146
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,668
he doesn't he doesn't have any idea how

147
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,829
he's gonna handle 35,000 cannabis cup

148
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:29,359
attendees not because of the number of

149
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,918
attendees but because they're attending

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,300
the cannabis cup something about the

151
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,609
event makes it special how we're going

152
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,069
to be we're going to be too high to

153
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,060
drive what I saw in a statement they're

154
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:43,009
really scared of DAV's

155
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,689
yeah to the average to normal person

156
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,250
who's never seen cannabis and sees me

157
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:48,199
pull out a torch and heat up a nail and

158
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,759
do this crack like looking drug I can

159
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,560
understand the fear but he's a police

160
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,000
officer he's a sheriff he needs to

161
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,468
figure out what's going on with the

162
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,449
medical marijuana community and be in

163
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:58,129
touch with us and come join us instead

164
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,050
of be afraid of us and try to persecute

165
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:02,120
us and prosecute us right spend ten

166
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,889
minutes talking to any member of the

167
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,038
community and Lula seems to be scary

168
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:09,050
truth I may look intimidating I may say

169
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,068
a lot of big crazy weird words but when

170
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,419
it comes down to it I'm a peaceful

171
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,379
chilled out dude and I'd love to sit

172
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:14,299
down and have a conversation with

173
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:15,589
anybody who needs to be educated

174
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,389
properly about cannabis that's what the

175
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:18,379
show is all about cannabis edumacation

176
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,598
that's what today is

177
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:23,089
there was there was a lot of hilarity I

178
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:25,699
think in this story if you look at some

179
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,799
of the reasons stated and quoted that

180
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,348
the permits wound up in Denver were

181
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,968
denied the two big reasons that are

182
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,848
cited over and over and over again in

183
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:36,430
the press are a a woman jumped out of

184
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,800
her car

185
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,629
like somewhere in or around the cannabis

186
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,728
cup or she had just attended her was on

187
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:44,860
her way it doesn't really specify but

188
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:47,668
like clearly marijuana use doesn't cause

189
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,410
jumping out of cars now I've smoked

190
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:51,758
people if you know me like Colorado sold

191
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,210
almost a billion dollars will be last

192
00:06:51,759 --> 00:07:01,720
year if it caused jumping out of cars we

193
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:04,508
would know how many people have I would

194
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,310
have a good band saying I smoke more

195
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,780
cannabis than ninety percent of the

196
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,360
people on the plane right like that's

197
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:13,269
not an effect we wouldn't see four years

198
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,830
down the road I made you jump out of

199
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:15,698
cars I would have done backflips out of

200
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,689
buses by now

201
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:18,520
right and there were thirty five

202
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,439
thousand people a day at the cup and one

203
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:23,288
woman jumped out of a car like that

204
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,668
exactly like event-related they forgot

205
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:26,769
to mention in the article that she took

206
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:27,939
a DAB and then she went and did a whole

207
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:31,779
bunch of Molly and then she drank

208
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:33,399
whiskey and then a chick jumping out of

209
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:36,149
a car one of the time and she was stoned

210
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:41,439

215
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,069

they're going to be looking for people

224
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,470
driving too high let's talk about this a

225
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,209
little bit I don't know the exact rule

226
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,620
here but they treat cannabis like

227
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:13,810
alcohol if you're going to be leaving

228
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,699
the cannabis cup have your cannabis in a

229
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,038
sealed container if you can put it in

230

you've got that smokeable edible

234
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,780
drinkable if it's cannabis infused

235
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:30,759
related if you can rub it on your balls

236
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:32,049
put it in the trunk of the car if you

237
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,208
don't have a trunk if you've got an SUV

238
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,859
put it in the backpack zip the backpack

239
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,739
up put it way in the back of the vehicle

240
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,440
have it out of reach of the driver don't

241
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,820
get yourself a DUI or an illegal

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,040
possession of cannabis ticket because

243
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,170
that is still a possible thing here in

244
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,189
Colorado it

245
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:52,049
um this cannabis cup if it goes off in

246
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,019
Pueblo is gonna be under a lot of

247
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:56,939
scrutiny and honestly pueblos could use

248
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,470
the cup down here and I'd really like to

249
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,440
see the event do well if it gets

250
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,670
approved at all I would love to see it

251
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,410
one of the big complaints in Adams

252
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:06,599
County was out-of-state dispensaries

253
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:09,469
coming here and selling weed and dabs at

254
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:14,310
their booths some of them were doing

255
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:17,278
donation legal mumbo jumbo other people

256
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:19,679
were straight doing sales Attili um at

257
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,240
least according to recent reports and

258
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,948
yeah that's a big no-no here which is

259
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,980
why none of our local dispensaries were

260
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:27,659
even handing out product at the cup I

261
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,430
get that the cup is supposed to be the

262
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:33,028
community gathering and celebrating and

263
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:35,009
having a huge smoke out but how you hand

264
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:36,629
out samples or what people bring to

265
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:39,689
smoke like there's a lot of rules around

266
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:41,399
that you need to know the law and please

267
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,709
try to comply with it like as much as

268
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,820

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,740
pass the tests remember we did the

283
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
episode a little while back about

284
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,250
interacting with law enforcement be

285
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,250
prepared for that [ __ ] if you're a

286
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,649
nervous person don't be extra high and

287
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,970
nervous when you're leaving the cut for

288
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,289
an extra hour you know understand if you

289
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,149
take a couple dad's hang out for an hour

290
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:23,698
when I went back and listened to that

291
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:26,190
episode the one thing I realized I meant

292
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:27,448
to emphasize and didn't was the easiest

293
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,100
way to not get in trouble with law

294
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:31,588
enforcement and to be calm and cool

295
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,449
during those interactions is to not be

296
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,190
breaking the law you know that's

297
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:36,539
something my buddy Lewis shoutout Magoo

298
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,370
he goes you know what you forgot to

299
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:39,689
[ __ ] mention was don't have [ __ ]

300
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,610

303
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,310
[ __ ] to have a cracked windshield

304
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:49,828
he said break one rule at a time his

305
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:51,568
advice not to Magoo fur I grew up in a

306
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:53,309
lawyer samuil if you haven't figured out

307
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:55,860
that figured that out yet by now I don't

308
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:57,929
know if you've been listening but that's

309
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,610
an old lawyer joke is like if you've got

310
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:02,338
to break the law break1 lot

311
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,480
and it's [ __ ] true like if you've got

312
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,250
weed in the car and you ain't allowed to

313
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,019
have weed make sure that that's the only

314
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,419
rule you're breaking if you're speeding

315
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,278
you're asking to get caught if you're

316
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,679
you've got a [ __ ] up car you're asking

317
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,600
to get car Ruth in a lot of states if

318
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,149
you look like Jeff you're asking hey hey

319
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,370
and what bite what some listeners don't

320
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,809
know some of the listeners this gets to

321
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,000
me occasionally some listeners don't

322
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:25,199
know this when people meet me or they

323
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,789
hear my voice somewhere they turn around

324
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,019
and like is that you cuz I go to the

325
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:30,360

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,730
for cannabinoids they all are required

488
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:50,189
to have a Colorado marijuana enforcement

489
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,159
agent badge which requires a thorough

490
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,620
FBI background check fingerprints and an

491
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,569
intensive intensive application process

492
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,970
if you don't meet the requirements

493
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,190
you're not gonna get a badge we'll get

494
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,078
to that we'll get to that so let's talk

495
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,039
about the steps on how to get this badge

496
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,568
because if you want to work in a

497
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,970
dispensary this is the first thing that

498
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:10,259
you need to do and this is really really

499
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,449
important if you're thinking about

500
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,789
moving here to work in legal weed know

501
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,589
this before you move yes there's one

502
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:17,879
step in here that you'll need to know

503
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:19,889
and we'll get to it I'm excited to get

504
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,179
to it's one I did a lot of a lot of

505
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,650
research that's one of my favorite parts

506
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,120
to get to because there's a buttload of

507
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,160
people who moved here that didn't know

508
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,659
how to do none of this and don't meet

509
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,480
the requirements and so they're [ __ ]

510
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,370
yeah or they're stuck trying to get a

511
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,870
job doing whatever it is it was they

512
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:35,399
were doing that they hated so much they

513
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:36,808
moved across the country to learn work

514
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,350
in legal weed or they're trying to set

515
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:40,119

of things to filter through though it's

542
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:38,378
confusing and what you're looking for

00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:43,538
actual application that you need cuz

546

550
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:53,798
seconds I think I made a note to talk

551
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,450
about that so find the application read

552
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,308
and review the application you'll get to

553
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,259
a part that says this marijuana

554
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:01,000
occupational employee application form

555
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:02,409
is an official document if you provide

556
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,298
false information on your marijuana

557
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:05,830
license application and/or do not

558
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:08,710
disclose all information the application

559
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:11,378
asks your license is subject to denial

560
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,480
or revocation and you may be subject to

561
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:15,009
criminal prosecution the marijuana

562
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,538
Enforcement Division will conduct a

563
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,980
complete background investigation and

564
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:20,138
we'll check all sources of information

565

579
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,399

581

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,820
minute like we'll get more specific but

593
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,710
like really just tell the truth

594
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,240

595
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,710
requirements if you don't meet them

596
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,480
straight up don't try cuz you ain't

597
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,100
gonna get passed and if you do it's a

598
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,700
special crime this is the age of the

599
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:27,980
Internet if you did some [ __ ] like just

600
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,569
write it down they really don't care as

601
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,860
long as it violates the couple of

602
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:32,629
requirements and they play those

603
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:34,609
straight up and down for the most part I

604
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,649
might hurt one person who didn't get

605
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:38,119
their badge and they tried to make it

606
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:39,889
sound like a big conspiracy that was

607
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,918
like nah dude it was that felony three

608
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:45,710
years ago oh yeah well trivia the

609
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,320
disqualifying conditions it says these

610
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,788
questions go like this have you ever

611
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:52,278
discharged a sentence for a conviction

612
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:54,079
of a felony pursuant to any state or

613
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:56,179
federal law regarding the possession

614
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,439
distribution manufacturing cultivation

615
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:00,048
or use of a controlled substance

616
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,850
including probation or parole within the

617
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:03,408
last ten years even if the conviction

618
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:05,658
occurred more than ten years ago

619
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:06,830
so that means have you been in jail for

620
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:08,899
any felon it is that what that means

621
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:10,668
discharge the sentence that's no drug

622
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:12,889
felonies in ten years is what that

623
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:16,220
questions asking about like you have to

624
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:18,590
have completed the jail sentence and any

625
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,009
probation or parole at least ten years

626
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:23,720
before you apply for your MIT badge so

627
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:26,269
ten years ago you guys if you have it's

628
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,669
a drug felony ten years drosphila

629
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:30,379
let's be specific it says drug felony

630
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,299
yes oh yeah you had to have drugs

631
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,070
involved in your felony and it has to be

632
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:37,278
more than ten years ago if that happened

633
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:40,490
if it was nine years and 365 days

634
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:42,109
because it's [ __ ] leap year then

635
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,460
you're still not able to qualify you

636
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:46,729
gotta wait another day and then apply

637
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,380
yeah so condition number two have you

638
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,200
served a sentence including probation

639
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,090
parole within the last five years upon

640
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,769
conviction for any felony even if the

641
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,839
conviction occurred more than five years

642
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:59,418
ago so once again if you're on probation

643
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,548
or parole five years ago or within the

644
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:03,649
last five years you are not allowed to

645
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:04,799
work in the industry so no drug felonies

646
00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:07,769
and ten no felony

647
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,869
period in five or probation or parole

648
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:11,879
yep in the probation of parole for many

649
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:13,409
of those felonies has to be got done at

650
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,120
least that many years ago and then this

651
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,000
one is neat are you a licensed physician

652
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,769
making patient recommendations yep if

653
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,079
you're a doctor in the industry you

654
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:23,639
can't be affiliated with a dispensary

655
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,319
you're involved with that part of it so

656
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,750
you don't need a badge that makes good

657
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,339
sense I understand like that that rule

658
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,690
kind of makes sense and I really get

659
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:32,759
where they're going with the felony rule

660
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:36,360
they're really trying to play it so that

661
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:39,000
the state can say with all reassurance

662
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:42,139
that people who were dealing drugs in

663
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,490
the past aren't owning dispensaries and

664
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,350
an easy way to do that is to make sure

665
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,569
that anyone convicted to selling drugs

666
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:52,169
doesn't get to be a dispensary owner for

667
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:53,669
at least the first decade and yeah that

668
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,170
kind of sucks for people who got busted

669
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,200
back in the day and they're not trying

670
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,730
to be totally straight-up legal but

671
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,230
that's how Colorado wants to play in

672
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,390
this position part they just don't want

673
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,059
you to be a doctor hanging out is

674
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,770
they've quash that elongation yeah yeah

675
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,929
all right number four says have you had

676
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:11,279
your authority to act as primary

677
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,920
caregiver revoked by the state health

678
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,960
agency so if you're you were somebody's

679
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,880
primary caregiver as not under the

680
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,170
Medical Marijuana type of caregiver but

681
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,760
as their caregiver for somebody who is

682
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,470
elderly or disabled if that's been

683
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,509
revoked you are not allowed to work in

684
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,730

685
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:28,829
is are you under 21 years of age you

686

814
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,120
automatically mean a no it means you got

815
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:20,889
some explaining to do those those okay

816
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,869
yeah the first ones were knows yeah the

817
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,870
first ones are automatic knows if it's a

818
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:30,039
felony in ten years or a felony in five

819
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:31,419
years a drug-related felony in ten if

820
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,750
you're a cop or I don't remember what

821
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,250
the last one was copper doctor those all

822
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,079
disqualify you those all dqu

823
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,579
automatically but the only two of those

824
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,240
that apply to most of the people listen

825
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:43,480
to the show

826
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:48,549
sooo alright alright she don't think any

827
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,720
cops listen to the show well maybe I

828
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:51,099
really hope there are law enforcement

829
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,600
officers listening to the show and

830
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:54,519
because the more I think about it

831
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:56,289
there's probably a couple you know I

832
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,789
remember listeners there was an event

833
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:59,440
that we did for the show we did a live

834
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:01,178
show somewhere the place doesn't exist

835
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,710
anymore but we did a live show somewhere

836
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:03,880
and we invited people to come and I made

837
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,710
flyers for the show

838
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,900
right and I put out flyers for the

839
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,509
podcast to come listen to wall people it

840
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,490
was a smoking place I remember because I

841
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:14,049
used to sit in a room with a number of

842
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,210
members of law enforcement every Monday

843
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,428
night okay and so like when this

844
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,319
happened that I was keenly aware of how

845
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:23,259
many officers were in that room every

846
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,149
Monday night I put out flyers to listen

847
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:26,829
to the podcast at a smoking event and

848
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,360
somehow law enforcement found the Flyers

849
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:30,428
and thought that they were like some

850
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,379
sort of tickets to get free weed at the

851
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:33,700
event or something and so in the next

852
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,780
episode I gave a shout out to the cops

853
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,160
open that they were listening because

854
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:37,629
they had the Flyers and it said how to

855
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,009
listen I had a little QR code if you

856
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,020
scanned it would take you to iTunes and

857
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:42,069
you could hear this show so if you're in

858
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,058
law enforcement I appreciate you for

859
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:44,500
listening I hope you're learning the

860
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:45,910
truth about cannabis it's not evil it's

861
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,859
not terrible it doesn't ruin anybody

862
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,820
we're not that scary we do understand

863
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:50,678
that there are laws that you have to

864
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:51,759
enforce but we wish that you would do

865
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:53,050
what you can to change the laws because

866
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,819
I'm sure you see that it's not a problem

867
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:55,779
where you are officer much respect for a

868
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,730
thanks for doing what you do

869
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:58,839
alright so print the application that's

870
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,549
the next step here we're gonna keep this

871
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:02,470
show on track Mike's got a DD today

872
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,669
print the application complete the

873
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:07,269
application that shouldn't be too hard

874
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:09,789
so at that point obtain any court papers

875
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:11,230
that you need any arrest disclosure

876
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:13,029
forms anything like that if you've got

877
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,620
tax paper forms that you need if you

878
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:18,609
have child support paper forms that you

879
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:21,759

00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,530
steering's than it is to sit there and

892
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,089
wait for like three hours in Denver if

893
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:47,589
that's what I did in a kind of sucked

894

00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,929
Springs I showed up about 15 minutes

897
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,649
early because I thought it would take

898
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:55,269
much longer to get

899
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,620
it's hard to judge i-25 it could take

900
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:58,240
you now it weren't how would I have to

901
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:00,099
get from here there so I got there about

902
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,390

00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:12,190

perfect for a decade but they had still

971
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:22,899

972
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,460
courthouses getting paperwork so that

973
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,130

985
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,230
step of the process when you get there

well prepared I knew plenty of people

we neither of us had an issue but we've

995
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:09,820
all talked to countless people that have

996
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:12,550
no idea what this process looks like

997
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:15,190
they even moved to Colorado moved across

998
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,810
the country unprepared and so knowing

999
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,670
this and doing it right is sort of

1000
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:20,289
essential folks if you've got forty four

1001

1004
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,069
known why we call them forty four and

1005
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,500

it so and that's happy to answer these

1054
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:03,170
questions super important they do not

1055
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:05,389
take cash bring a money order or bring a

1056
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,710
check if you're going to get your key

1057
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:08,058
badge and this is where we'll talk about

1058
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,179
this part if you're going to get your

1059
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:12,740
key badge it's gonna cost you $300 if

1060
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:14,358
you want your support badge it is a

1061
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:15,919
hundred and fifty dollars my colectomy

1062
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:17,869
is that wrong dude cuz I just know what

1063
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,230
surprises were right but I think Denver

1064
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:22,670
takes cash I'm like 85% just somebody

1065
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:26,329
else that was helping me with this

1066
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:28,460
episode should my change will not accept

1067
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:29,930
cash and the website says bring check or

1068
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,028
money order so I'm pretty sure they quit

1069
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:34,399
accepting cash just that what surprised

1070
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:35,778
me the I knew that only one office did

1071
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,338
and I could have sworn it was Denver but

1072
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:40,068
I might have taken the check I worked at

1073
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:41,900
a place that had a lot of cash flow like

1074
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:42,920
we had a lot of cash in the end of the

1075
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,139
register at the end of they I've worked

1076
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,798
at several places and just imagine how

1077
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:51,969
many applications they handle add $150

1078
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:55,759
the badge minimum times 16,000 employees

1079
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:57,108
huh imagine / 365 days people you can do

1080
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,450
the battery guys you just don't want

1081
00:36:57,108 --> 00:37:01,848
that much money in a box and then the

1082
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:03,649
office anywhere like over a [ __ ]

1083
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:05,359
couple of days that boxes full of cash

1084
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,309
so I understand they probably they just

1085
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,028
be prepared you guys take a check or

1086
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,559
take a money order

1087
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:11,539
just stop it somewhere that sells a

1088
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:13,160
money order freaking Walmart sucks they

1089
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:14,599
have money orders I think most Walgreens

1090
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:20,000
will sell you a money order several

1091
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:21,559
7-eleven 7-eleven money order go to the

1092
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,059
meed place now let's talk about the

1093
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,519
difference between a key badge and a

1094
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:27,920
support badge there always has to be a

1095
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,469
support badge on premises nobody can be

1096
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,880
in micro without a support battery there

1097
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:33,318
has to be a red badge which is the owner

1098
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,769
badge if to own the place to get that

1099
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,449
one

1100
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:37,579
or a key badge if you don't have a key

1101
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:39,349
badge if there's not a key badge on

1102
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:40,880
premises nobody else can be in there

1103
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:44,630
none of the support badges can be in the

1104
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,610
room so I find it advantageous to go

1105
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,140
ahead and get that key badge because

1106
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,519
then you're kind of more qualified to do

1107
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:52,250
more [ __ ] you've already got more

1108
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:55,039
ability to take on more responsibility I

1109
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,230
made sure to get the key yeah and did it

1110
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,719
help you do you feel like getting your

1111
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,190
key badge helped you advance in your

1112
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,079
position at the spot I think those rules

1113
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:08,690
are more heavily enforced on the medical

1114
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:10,099
side okay or maybe I'm just no I've got

1115
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:12,349
to be the odd the only support badge

1116
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:14,029
several nights a week at work why do I

1117
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:17,809
or my only key badge that might be why I

1118
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:20,930
got promoted yes it just makes you more

1119
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:22,639
promotable so a support badge you can be

1120
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:25,309
like a budtender you can be a trimmer

1121
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,079
you can be a joint roller you can in the

1122
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:28,429
gardens you can support badges the

1123
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,469
starter badge like if you've only got

1124
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:31,940
150 to spend on a badge and you know

1125
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:34,519
you're gonna be a trimmer for the first

1126
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,929
year like tinder or a budtender you can

1127
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,250
go ahead and get the support like we're

1128
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:39,889
not saying don't but the key badge

1129
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,239
definitely gives you more opportunities

1130
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:43,400
in the industry and if you're one of

1131
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:47,929
those people that's moving to Colorado

1132
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,980
with the degree in biochemistry like you

1133
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:51,769
might want to go ahead and get the

1134
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:54,019
support badge or the key badge I'm sorry

1135
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:56,090
I think you mixing those two I was

1136
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:56,509
trying to figure you confused me so I'm

1137
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,430
sorry

1138
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,990
yes the cube edge is the more important

1139
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:01,279
one I was looking for the distinguishing

1140
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,868
it says something about on the

1141
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,850
application if you're going to have keys

1142
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:06,619
and be in charge of employees and have

1143
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:08,599
access to limited access areas you

1144
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:09,920
should go ahead and get a key badge

1145
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,118
so I recommend of course get the key

1146
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,950
badge if you don't have the money for it

1147
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,809
get yourself a support badge if you're

1148
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:15,980
an ambitious ambitious person and you

1149
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:18,170
feel like you want to move up if you're

1150
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,429
gonna manage that [ __ ] get the key go

1151
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,690
ahead and get a key badge if you want to

1152
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:22,219
work with the grow team if you're real

1153
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,108
enthusiastic and you can show that you

1154
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:25,549
can do it get yourself a key badge we'd

1155
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:27,469
love to see you move up in the industry

1156
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,480
super quickly I knew I wasn't gonna be

1157
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:31,429
on the bottom rung for long so I fully

1158
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,559
got that one on purpose like I know a

1159
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:34,940
lot of the people that did that too and

1160
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,190
I know a couple of people who got the

1161
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,079
support and have been kind of passed

1162
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,880
over several times because they can't

1163
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,230
meet some of those requirements that you

1164
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,390
have to have the key for gotta have a

1165
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,849
key badge on premises at all times if I

1166
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:48,829
got to be pretty much in the same room

1167
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:51,199
with the support badges they don't even

1168
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:52,730
leave them in another room so all right

1169
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,679
so if you want to be like the

1170
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,119
cultivation manager get a keypad you

1171
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:57,949
feeling to be a trim team leader you get

1172
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,630
a key badge maybe even if you want to be

1173
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:01,369
lead budtender you might need a key

1174
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,559
badge because you'll be carrying product

1175
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:05,630
back to the storage room which requires

1176
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:08,509
a key badge to get into or at least it

1177
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,869
should so get your badge it's gonna cost

1178
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,430
money

1179
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:11,900
decide which badge you want the next

1180
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:13,369

00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,920
like you're gonna have a really hard

1252
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:43,960
time looking for a dispensary that's

1253
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,838
actively looking for a marketing dude

1254
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,039
who's never worked in legal weed before

1255
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,949
and doesn't necessarily know the

1256
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:52,900
community the culture of the product the

1257
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:54,699
clients like there's a lot you need to

1258
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,619
know and you learn that when you start

1259
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:58,419
as a blood gender a tremor it's a whole

1260
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,519
and a kit it's a whole world to be

1261
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,769
involved in a buddy of mine started as a

1262
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,659
trimmer in like six weeks later he was

1263
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:05,920
running a trim crew for like seven

1264
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:08,289
different dispensaries and they just

1265
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,289
cycled between them as they harvested

1266
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:14,048
shout-out to Linus yep shoutout - like

1267
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:15,759
he had a he struggled for a while find a

1268
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:18,579
dispensary that would even take him on

1269
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,710
as a trimmer and when he finally found

1270
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:24,460
one he made sure to put it in his all

1271
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,809
and now he's running a big ass crew and

1272
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,490
a big crew I see what he's got on

1273
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:29,170
Facebook and he's killing it his crews

1274

done a good job I'm the same way you're

1276
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:37,000
the same way like we moved up quick be

00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:39,519
motivated if I come here and work so

1278
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,780
rapidly we're growing so rapidly and

1279
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,130
there are so many people coming from

1280
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,548
around the world to be in this industry

1281
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:47,890
that there are 50 people trying to take

1282
00:43:45,548 --> 00:43:50,108
your job in this industry every [ __ ]

1283
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:52,328
day green and healthy wellness is a

1284
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:54,369
small shop with a small know a small

1285
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,568
location we aren't very well known yet

1286
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:56,829
we're kind of new we don't have a large

1287
00:43:55,568 --> 00:43:58,420
following I think that's what I'm trying

1288
00:43:56,829 --> 00:44:00,700
to say with a whole bunch of words we

1289
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:03,250
don't have a huge following but we get

1290
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:04,838
probably five to ten applications every

1291
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,298
single day of people that want to be

1292
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:08,679
growers trimmers get bud tenders

1293
00:44:07,298 --> 00:44:09,579
whatever they can do they like I will

1294
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,929
clean the toilet

1295
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:13,569
as long as you give me a job in there

1296
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:15,699
yeah I see some crazy I see a lot of

1297
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,740
people coming in that are doing it right

1298
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:20,799
that are ready to work that know the

1299
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:24,189
industry and know how to sell their

1300
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,360
place in it and a lot of it comes down

1301
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:28,090
to like knowing how to pitch your

1302
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,800
previous work experience because I sold

1303
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,490
weed for my living room for the last ten

1304
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,350
years

1305
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:37,989
looks like yeah it does you did an

1306
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:40,329
episode before that covered like some of

1307
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:41,949
the red resumes you gotten to grow and

1308
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:44,799
how ridiculous some of them could get

1309
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:47,339
put together real resume like if you

1310
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,870
don't know what that is google it yeah

1311
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,370
be prepared because there's a lot of

1312
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:54,339
people gunning for the jobs that are

1313
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:56,409
available even with this how fast we're

1314
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,340
expanding so if you want to stand out at

1315
00:44:56,409 --> 00:45:00,339
all you got to do all right

1316
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:02,980
no let's talk about some of the problems

1317
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:05,170
that come with getting a job working in

1318
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,750
the cannabis industry the number one

1319
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:11,400
most obvious problem to me is banking

1320
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:14,260
yep that's an issue when you worked at a

1321
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,539
dispensary or as a grower and I can't

1322
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,530
speak for every shop or every grow and

1323
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:19,269
this is something that I probably

1324
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:22,660
shouldn't say too much about but this is

1325
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:26,349
the damn truth when payday comes you get

1326
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:28,089
an envelope stuffed with cash everything

1327
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:30,130
is done in cash it sucks

1328
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:31,930
yeah you get a pay stub and taxes are

1329
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,970
taken out and that you get a solution

1330
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:36,549
jobs is the same but instead of a check

1331
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:38,889
at the bottom or better yet a voided

1332
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:41,980
check that tells you about the direct

1333
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:44,589
deposit you just got you get a check

1334
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,990
stub folded up with a bunch of 20s in

1335
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:48,700
the middle a bunch of [ __ ] yeah you got

1336
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:50,439
to carry all these damn twenties in your

1337
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:52,329
backpack or somehow to the car and then

1338
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,030
home but it's not just payroll it's

1339
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:59,259
everything like state taxes federal

1340
00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:00,580
taxes electric bills rent it's it's yeah

1341
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,770
so when you get home you got to figure

1342
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:04,420
out a way to convert all that cash into

1343
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:07,420
some way to pay your rent so that is the

1344
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,940
obvious problem luckily employees can

1345
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,099
usually get back accounts it's smaller

1346
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,780
banks no problem it's the businesses

1347
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:15,579
that really can't get accounts but

1348
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,290
you've still got a transfer cash to bank

1349
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:20,230
right right you gotta hand that cash

1350
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:21,838
came from a dispensary sometimes it

1351
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:26,460
stinks like we

1352
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:28,288
your account to get closed we have a

1353
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,150
mutual friend whose account was just

1354
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:31,739
closed because their cash deposits

1355
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:36,210
smelled way too much like cannabis

1356
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:37,559
shout-out to that person yeah also one

1357
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,940
of the problems we've talked about this

1358
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,380
a little bit on the podcast another

1359
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,940
problem that can happen if you work in

1360
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,229
the cannabis industry is you're gonna

1361
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,150
get pulled over you're gonna smell like

1362
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:47,759
a pound of [ __ ] weed and the cops are

1363
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:49,139
gonna harass you if you've got a badge a

1364
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:50,699
lot of times they expect you to be a

1365
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,078
model citizen because you've got the

1366
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:53,308
badge and you know the rules

1367
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,809
it we're gonna be a little more careful

1368
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:58,710
we're back to putting your best foot

1369
00:46:54,809 --> 00:47:01,559
forward like don't stink like weed with

1370
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:03,059
your badge and also how because they're

1371
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:04,920
good they're gonna as soon as they see

1372
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:06,809
that [ __ ] or even the green lanyard

1373
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,059
that goes with it they're automatically

1374
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:11,309
gonna be thinking is this person high

1375
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:14,548
right now behind the wheel do I have a

1376
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:18,119
DUI arrest so don't be that person true

1377
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:19,380
also renting is hard yeah getting a

1378
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,849
house is hard when your place of

1379
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,579
employment is green and health and

1380
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:25,229
wellness there's a stigma involved that

1381
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:28,548
a lot of people don't realize I've got a

1382
00:47:25,228 --> 00:47:32,578
friend leaving the industry right now

1383
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:35,219
and they were talking to me just this

1384
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:37,670
afternoon that they're applying for jobs

1385
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:41,099
that aren't in the cannabis industry and

1386
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:42,869
he's real hesitant because he hasn't

1387
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,059
faced the company the drug tests in a

1388
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:47,460
decade

1389
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:50,940
he's a budtender and a cannabis consumer

1390
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:53,880
and passionate about cannabis really

1391
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,679
enjoys that aspect of his life and at

1392
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,559
minimum he's gonna have to give it up

1393
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,268
until he can pee clean and he wasn't

1394
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,789
except necessarily expecting to leave

1395
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:06,568
the industry this abruptly so he's not

1396
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:07,799
prepared for that and so it best his ass

1397
00:48:06,568 --> 00:48:09,869
is gonna be out of work for a while

1398
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:13,920
while he looks for either jobs that

1399
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:15,660
don't test or whatnot but he's extra

1400
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,119
hesitant because as soon as they're like

1401
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,528
well what did you just get stopped doing

1402
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,329
and he's like well I'd work in the

1403
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:24,199
marijuana industry for three years and

1404
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:26,339
now I'm trying to get a job at a bank or

1405
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:27,689
you know wherever the hell outs

1406
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:29,639
Wow yeah yeah they're gonna they're

1407
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,440
gonna be judgmental for sure right so

1408
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:33,118
like even if they don't typically drug

1409
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,650
test or there's a lot of companies I

1410
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,850
worked for a bunch of them back in the

1411
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,400
day they just threatened did

1412
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:40,019
test and that the only drug test they do

1413
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,960
is whether or not you show up to get

1414
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:44,880
your cup they can't actually afford to

1415
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,269
pay like the 75 bucks or whatever to

1416
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,130
test yeah yeah even those companies are

1417
00:48:48,269 --> 00:48:53,039
more apt to test somebody who's coming

1418
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:55,680
out of the legal weed industry it's just

1419
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,009
got that same edge to it so getting

1420
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,960
banking renting cars who's gonna get

1421

insufficient employment and I make a

00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:06,059
statement that you're gonna take on and

1451
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:08,669
you kinda have to be ready to bear that

1452
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:10,920
cross it's not just out in the world

1453
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:12,960
like plenty you got family that's like

1454
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,450
Oh [ __ ] cousin Ricky working at the

1455
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,730
weed store and we should mention all the

1456
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:19,529
drug testing talk the dispensary bong

1457
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:21,090
drug test you noop don't worry but don't

1458
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:23,519
show up high either don't be an [ __ ]

1459
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:25,230
if there's too many [ __ ] rules to

1460
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,579
come toast if we can't tell you're high

1461
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,809
it's ok if we can tell you're high

1462
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:34,199
you're in trouble don't be that high

1463
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:37,259
[ __ ] obvious problems with working in

1464
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:39,389
the industry are banking credit getting

1465
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:42,090
a car getting a loan that kind of [ __ ]

1466
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:43,469
is hard shout-out to my friend Jessica I

1467
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:45,269
asked her for guidance on this because

1468
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:47,429
she is a manager in a dispensary she

1469
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:48,369
said the first thing she spouted off

1470
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:50,608
with the passion

1471
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:53,108
[ __ ] sexism in the cannabis industry

1472
00:50:50,608 --> 00:50:55,088
this is she called it a boys club and

1473
00:50:53,108 --> 00:50:56,170
said that this is ran by guys and she's

1474
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:57,998
a woman and it's hard to be taken

1475
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:01,389
[ __ ] seriously by all the men in this

1476
00:50:57,998 --> 00:51:03,248
industry so ladies uh when you come to

1477
00:51:01,389 --> 00:51:06,129
Colorado your chances of getting a job

1478
00:51:03,248 --> 00:51:08,318
are nearly tripled of what a guy with

1479
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,269
the same qualifications are going to

1480
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,798
have the chances of that same dude are

1481
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:13,508
gonna have of getting employment I know

1482
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:15,038
that sounds rude to say they don't care

1483
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:17,019
what you look like if you're a trimmer

1484
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:19,960
for the most part but if you're a

1485
00:51:17,018 --> 00:51:21,488
budtender automatically hot females go

1486
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,048
to the top of the stack and that's kind

1487
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:24,880
of true in any industry but it's really

1488
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:26,409
true it's super true in the cannabis

1489
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,920
industry unfortunately so you're gonna

1490
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:30,788
get hired first at the same time

1491
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,950
everybody's gonna look at your titties

1492
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:34,749
all [ __ ] day long in the cannabis

1493
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:36,129
industry that we are used to growing

1494
00:51:34,748 --> 00:51:39,268
weed in our basement we're used to being

1495
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:41,858
a bunch of bros it's kind of a boys club

1496
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:43,389
we should know this by now but the grow

1497
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:45,518
environment the weed business

1498
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:48,068
environment sometimes people forget and

1499
00:51:45,518 --> 00:51:52,929
it gets a little bit sexist a little bit

1500
00:51:48,068 --> 00:51:55,298
so you have the rules the necess tree

1501
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:57,429
like we're under so many weed specific

1502
00:51:55,298 --> 00:51:59,619
rules that in a lot of ways the ball

1503
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:02,498
gets dropped with some of the others so

1504
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:04,660
slap us remind us be like boys or women

1505
00:52:02,498 --> 00:52:06,038
in the room behavior [ __ ] themselves and

1506
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:08,588
a guy like myself will check myself

1507
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:10,210
after one or two of those I don't say

1508
00:52:08,588 --> 00:52:11,349
some [ __ ] when damsels around shut up

1509
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,489
damsel I've learned to respect the

1510
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:14,318
ladies a little bit better because I've

1511
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:15,940
been reminded so shout out to the ladies

1512
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:17,798
that have taught us that there is some

1513
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,528
sexism in the cannabis industry be

1514
00:52:17,798 --> 00:52:23,559
prepared for that a little bit another

1515
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:25,539
huge problem you cannot consume on site

1516
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:27,009
if you want to consume cannabis while

1517
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:28,839
you're working at a medical marijuana or

1518
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:31,179
a recreational marijuana grow facility

1519
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:33,639
processing facility anything like that

1520
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:35,379
you cannot do it anywhere near the

1521
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:37,838
building you got a note go somewhere

1522
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:40,059
else I don't care where you go to the

1523
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:44,228
cameras cannot see you people that are

1524
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:46,539
leaving the dispensary should go far

1525
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:46,838
away consume your medicine somewhere far

1526
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:50,469
away

1527
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:52,150
safely that goes for customers to like

1528
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:53,798
you're shopping in the league we de

1529
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:56,318
distrito try to [ __ ] roll join the

1530
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:58,568
parking lot yeah yeah well okay yeah

1531
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:01,150
don't do that get out of there also

1532
00:52:58,568 --> 00:53:01,960
something that I would mention is a pain

1533
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,309
in the ass and the

1534
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,050
this industry and you may think I'm

1535
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:08,920
crazy some people can make glam but

1536
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:12,280
there is so much tedious regulation and

1537
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,240
so much pressure they were way overboard

1538
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,790
with the regulation and like just I

1539
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:21,159
watch people every day grind up scraps

1540
00:53:18,789 --> 00:53:24,519
of marijuana like stems like [ __ ] that

1541
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:25,989
you wouldn't even consider feeling bad

1542
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:26,588
about if you threw away like it's just

1543
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:28,809
trash

1544
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:29,710
they have to grind it with coffee and

1545
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:32,199
shredded paper to make it

1546
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:34,510
indistinguishable and unusable yes like

1547
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:38,739
it when that you translate that to a

1548
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:40,390
major grow the amount of like just how

1549
00:53:38,739 --> 00:53:43,929
you throw out the trash becomes a

1550
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:46,960
majorly complicated process so what do I

1551
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:49,299
run the the big row we are harvesting 85

1552
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,269
lights worth of plants when a trashes on

1553
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:54,550
you right so what we do I will start a

1554
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:56,289
trash can where the trimmers are and

1555
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:58,240
I'll put I'll harvest the plant and I

1556
00:53:56,289 --> 00:54:00,009
will put that pot of dirt in the bottom

1557
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,569
of the can now there's like a little bit

1558
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,859
of dirt in the bottom and then as we

1559
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,088
trim the leaves and a little bit of

1560
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:06,250
sticks will go in and then I'll go

1561
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:08,519
harvest another plant or maybe we've got

1562
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:12,579
old pots stacked up and I'll pour some

1563
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:14,559
and it goes dirt leaves dirt leaves and

1564
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:16,630
then like I'll sweep up the floor and

1565
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,429
[ __ ] and pick up sweepings in there but

1566
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,710
you got to mix up that weed the weed

1567
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:23,259
shouldn't be recognizable right and then

1568
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:27,730
it has to go into a locked trashcan

1569
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:29,710
which is also behind a gate and we still

1570
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,780
have had our [ __ ] trash broken into

1571
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:34,240
torn out of the dumpster they tear the

1572
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,680
bags open and they destroy all that and

1573
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,269
I got to go [ __ ] sweep it up and put

1574
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:39,039
the trash back in the goddamn trash can

1575
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:41,320
in the morning when I get there so there

1576
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:45,009
are a lot of regulations the regulations

1577
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:46,359
are ridiculous I have to everything's

1578
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:48,130
got to be weighed a million times

1579
00:54:46,358 --> 00:54:50,049
everything and there are checks on

1580
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:51,880
things also so it's a little bit

1581
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:54,490
stressful on all the regulation all the

1582
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,980
pressure is crazy things have to happen

1583
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:58,838
at a certain time things have to be done

1584
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,329
quickly you can't wait for some [ __ ] in

1585
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:03,429
a big grow and you're on camera from

1586
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:04,809
9000 different angles so don't ever

1587
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:05,409
think you're gonna get away with

1588
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:07,929
anything

1589
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:09,460
the be it on camera on every square

1590

inch-- takes some adjustment like I

1591
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,358

00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,930
and then the 2 addendum books so that's

1609
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:51,150
uh that's most of what I've got that's

1610
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:52,889
stressful but one thing that might can

1611
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:56,759
testify to because he's a budtender

1612
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:59,578
mostly now the consumer is so educated

1613
00:55:56,759 --> 00:56:01,409
that they expect a bud and and fo

1614
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:02,430
educated they think they know what the

1615
00:56:01,409 --> 00:56:04,588
[ __ ] they're talking about that they

1616
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:07,139
expected but I hear the phrase set of a

1617
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:10,739
lot and I hear good to go even more oh

1618
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:13,920
wow it's a good and a bad thing I'm

1619
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:16,048
blessed to be in the the medical side of

1620
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,139
things now I get a lot of that too but

1621
00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:21,028
honestly I see kind of a terse a more

1622
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:23,338
touristy side of it and honestly they

1623
00:56:21,028 --> 00:56:25,199
just haven't had the the culture in the

1624
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:27,119
community out loud and proud like we

1625
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:31,889
have here in Colorado like down in Texas

1626
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:34,769
in an Arkansas for is long but like you

1627
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:37,498
can really tell who who's been in the

1628
00:56:34,768 --> 00:56:39,508
community actively and who hasn't who's

1629
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:41,488
been like a marijuana consumer in the

1630
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:43,769
total shadows like most of their friends

1631
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:45,509
don't know they definitely wouldn't talk

1632
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:48,209
about it in public or on the news around

1633
00:56:45,509 --> 00:56:50,940
the radio so they've never heard anyone

1634
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:52,710
say sativa before or indica it's just

1635
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,960
never happened they've only ever read it

1636
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:56,519
and just thinking about that kind of

1637
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,409
boggles my mind a little bit so I try to

1638
00:56:56,518 --> 00:56:59,879
pity him a little bit but a [ __ ] when

1639
00:56:58,409 --> 00:57:01,259
I hear for like the 14th time on a

1640
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:06,599
Saturday it makes me want a [ __ ] [ __ ]

1641
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:09,269
punch somebody but I saw the same thing

1642
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:10,798
in the wine world like so it exists

1643
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:13,818
other places people think they know a

1644
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:15,960
lot and they act snotty it's funny I

1645
00:57:13,818 --> 00:57:17,880
love the dispensary where the budtender

1646
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,409
knows [ __ ] everything it makes you

1647
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,470
feel stupid and doesn't realize that I'm

1648
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:24,058
a breeder right like I love it when

1649
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:26,929
they're wrong I was in a shop the other

1650
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:28,640
day in Denver and I heard wrong from a

1651
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:30,169
there was a strain labeled wrong and I

1652
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,058
listened to the budtender go on for like

1653
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:34,068
four minutes about how it was an indica

1654
00:57:32,059 --> 00:57:35,510
when it's a really popular sativa and

1655
00:57:34,068 --> 00:57:37,940
I'm just sitting there shaking my head

1656
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:39,559
as the customer gobbles it up and I'm

1657
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:41,869
like dude look at the buds like I can

1658
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:44,329

and I want to be here as often as I can

1735

1738
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:30,930
lately that was her buddy Mike Oh was

1739
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,329
his name yep he sent a couple of emails

1740
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:34,799
which I like I like repeated updates

1741
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,969
yeah well he was a little pissed off

1742
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,200
that you hadn't been here for a little

1743
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:40,589
while he was kind of upset with the

1744
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:42,719
shelf life exploded and this show had to

1745
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:44,910
take a back burner for a while for for a

1746
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,039
minute there it was it was a big part of

1747
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:48,690
my extracurricular activities and I just

1748
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:49,409
sorted that time got filled big time

1749
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,909
yeah man

1750
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:52,079
I don't believe me at all that kid is

1751
01:00:50,909 --> 01:00:54,449
the most important thing in your world

1752
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,489
as it should be no but yeah the show's

1753
01:00:54,449 --> 01:00:58,469
still a priority so uh we're recording

1754
01:00:56,489 --> 01:01:02,069
real late at night like we said Chipotle

1755
01:00:58,469 --> 01:01:04,559
be [ __ ] close so yeah we're

1756
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:06,000
scratching it out but I wanted to be

1757
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,039
part of the show getting badges like

1758
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,079
I've seen so many people [ __ ] because

1759
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:14,610
they didn't know this information before

1760
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:15,840
they made a big little bleep and I want

1761
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,490
to really wanted to be a part of this

1762
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,930
show so yeah sorry for the ramblings

1763
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:20,729
hope you got the information you need

1764
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:26,099
