secret what up yeah big shot up to the

90
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,069
whole CBD crew so we're going to talk

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,719
about phenotype everybody here is a

92
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,099
pretty experienced grower so well

93
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,830
everyone will have a lot of input I

94
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,539
should explain what a phenotype is the

95
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,320
first thing I'll take one step back we

96
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:13,199
will explain a genotype the offspring of

97
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,599
two parents will make genetics and that

98
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,159
genetic makeup is the genotype out of

99
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,949
that genotype there will be various

100
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,189
phenotypes the best way I can think of

101
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,250
to compare it would be when your parents

102
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:26,660
make kids they don't all look the same

103
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,790
your dad's probably tall your mom's

104
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,160
brother little shorter one of them's got

105
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,930
blond hair one of them's got dark hair

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,340
when they make kids sometimes they come

107
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,360
out with kids with blonde hair sometimes

108
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,949
you come out kids with dark hair

109
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,439
sometimes you come out blue eyes some

110
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,579
time to come out brown-eyed plants are

111
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,660
going to do the same thing and that's to

112
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:46,459
be expected there are ways to minimize

113
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,590
those traits or bring out traits that

114
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:50,060
you're looking for but for the most part

115
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,979
when you're making seeds in the

116
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,569
beginning the seeds that most of you

117
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,890
guys are able to get your hands on what

118
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:59,360
a lot of the breeders are selling you

119
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:01,039
are going to be f1 f2 s or f3s there are

120
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,169
very few breeders going far further than

121
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,669
f4 there's one guy know that brags about

122
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:07,729
f5 which is really cool really

123
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:10,039
respectable so you're going to see a lot

124
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,689
of variation I just talked a lot I

125
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,460
drivel there's a lot of echo I feel like

126
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:15,740
I talked a lot about variation in

127
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:18,949
phenotypes and a lot of f1 and stuff so

128
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,870
in f1 when you take to plan a male and a

129
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:23,539
female plant those are now your p1's

130
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,629
when you breed them the seasons come out

131
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,800
of that our f1 that's the f1 generation

132
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,000
you're going to have a lot of variety

133
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,500
there some stuff is going to look like

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,779
mom some stuffs going to kind of look

135
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,620
like the dad you're going to get a lot

136
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,629
of tuition then you're going to get

137
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,649
stuff way in the middle between the mom

138
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:39,168
and the dad you'll get that perfect

139
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:41,389
hybrid and that's a lot of times the one

140
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:42,709
that everybody's looking for I'm in a

141
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:44,180
little further you'll make an apt to if

142
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,549
you take if you find a sweet male and a

143
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,750
sweet female out of those f1's and you

144
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,870
breathe those together you're going to

145
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,779
make an f2 f2 is where you come up with

146
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,509
something that we call transgressive

147
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:59,500
segregation which means and Jesse smiled

148
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:03,259
when I mentioned the trippy show transit

149
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,379
transgressive segregation is when your

150
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:08,300
actual progeny which is your offspring

151
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:10,519
outperforms the parents so if you take

152
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,350
tea seeds a male and a female you cross

153
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,149
them and that plant that comes out is

154
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,340
way more badass than the parents you

155
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:18,799
have just experienced transgressive

156
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,149
segregation so the s2 level is where you

157
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,490
really want to buy the seeds if a

158
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,989
breather selling those seeds a lot of us

159
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,930
don't really let you know what we're

160
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,978
giving you which as level how far it is

161
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,139
that's kind of personal stuff it's kind

162
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:31,339
of breeding secrets but those f2s are

163
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,259
awesome if you can get ahold of those

164
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:35,879
that's where a lot of cool [ __ ] happens

165
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,750
so we're going to kind of back up a

166
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,850
little bit the variation a lot of us at

167
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,410
the table seem to love the variation we

168
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,900
do what is called a fee no hon we buy a

169
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,200
pack of seeds you grow that whole pack

170
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,489
is usually 10 seeds and you look for if

171
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,589
you're not going to breed you eliminate

172
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,509
the female so hopefully you guys are the

173
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:57,179
mail to thank you thanks I'm dab dab I

174
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:59,099
don't know which is that good understand

175
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,410
yeah but thanks for watching my back so

176
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,960
you got to pull those mails and then you

177
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,760
keep it going I'm sorry I'm trying to

178
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,889
catch my breath also you got this

179
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,659
feedback you keep the females going you

180
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,430
try to find the good ones you look for

181
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,980
the traits that those are putting off

182
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,129
early on you can tell structure speed of

183
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,050
growth bigger bigger leaf size you can

184
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:21,689
tell kind of if you get a more indica or

185
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,699
sativa leaning phenotype notes making

186
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,740
notes pacing there you go a lot of

187
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,479
people like to kind of jerk the stem a

188
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,189
little bit and smell that and they think

189
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
that that's going to lead to a lot of

190
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:32,969
what it's going to really smell like in

191
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,110
the end yeah sometimes now what do you

192
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:42,630
look for I like smell a really important

193
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:44,730
note spacing growth patterns of early

194
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,990
resin production early resin production

195
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,290
so you want to be that resin about day

196
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,269
35 ish get frosty if things are going

197
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:55,290
real well for sure okay how about

198
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:57,269
yourself over there new guy you want a

199
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,530
louder or quieter total oh it's just

200
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,779
this thing over here it has talked about

201
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,759
this headphone thing I'm usually looking

202
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,009
for Jesus Lee a shorter stockier flat

203
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,199
shorter stocky plants yeah but not

204
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,279
necessarily i usually like more indica

205
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,560
plants that's why i'm usually looking

206
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,779
for a surgery stock your plan ok but I

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,550
makes good sense yeah I also don't like

208
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,439
when they wave around too much is

209
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,449
usually when they start stacking they're

210
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,219
going to need to be staked up

211
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:21,689
essentially ok slightly when I supports

212
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,330
itself a little all right how about you

213
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:27,120
sent home for when I groceries you can

214
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:28,829
usually you know figure out whether or

215
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,569
not your plants going to be a full

216
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:33,418
depending like sometimes I grow plants

217
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:35,099
under a scrog net so like the lankier

218
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:36,840
plants you'll get will be better for a

219
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,030
strong net in my opinion and then you're

220
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,519
you know shorter stockier planes over

221
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,468
your just freestanding plants that you

222
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,750
can stake down and don't have to give

223
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,860
too much support besides that but you

224
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,250
know bigger

225
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,019
smells and then I look for like

226
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,909
especially if I know what it's coming

227
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,889
from you can look at like your leaf set

228
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,569
and see if they start matching parents

229
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,278
yeah there's stuff like that and you can

230
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,778
know which parent you've gotta go all

231
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:01,980
right you said something sort of

232
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,049
interesting that leads me to another

233
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,639
point doing the pheno huh running a pack

234
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,708
of seeds and looking for that fee know

235
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,179
that you like both of these guys grow

236
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,759
difference everybody in this room droves

237
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,399
a different style yep Vince does remote

238
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,019
dragnet I don't do any Scroggin I like

239
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
to run a seven gallon pot so those

240
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,470
plants you guys are worried about waving

241
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,060
around I've got a tomato cage on those

242
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,800
early on in life so they're not going to

243
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,689
get back around appreciate your doing

244
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,819
that I want that stretchy phenotype

245
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,500
stretchy but I mean with some high to it

246
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,670
I like hey look that's what I'm just

247
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,528
gonna talk into my damn leg you know

248
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:34,259
where you come up to it's like like that

249
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:35,669
mouth a lot better that way I always

250
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:36,899
said one get up on the mic I'm the one

251
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:39,778
over here nowhere near the microphone

252
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:43,620
get punk with it oh no you don't all my

253
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:47,820

shop the other day big shout out to

257
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,539
high-growth Pueblo burn was working and

258
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,339
she treated me well it was awesome work

259
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,379
store looks great everything's nice and

260
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,149
clean cool there's one big empty spot

261
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,659
now where I was shopping feel sure it'll

262
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:05,190
be refilled already is nice alright

263
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:08,250
we're talking about phenotypes and

264
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,930
variation some people get angry about

265
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,750
variation oh it's been said to talk

266
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:14,370
about s once we skipped s1 s1 is when I

267
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,208
do a lot of ass ones that's a feminized

268
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,070
feed essentially or kind of usually like

269
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,989
if i take my grateful dogs to grateful

270
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,839
dawg clones of the same plant reverse

271
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,659
one so that pollen on the other one in

272
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,579
flower those seeds are not a new it's

273
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,409
not a new breed it's just an s-1 I've

274
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:34,139
self it and made speeds of that same

275
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:36,028
thing so that's an s-1 I find that those

276
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,639
a lot of people hate on feminized seeds

277
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:39,870
but if an s-1 is done properly and I

278
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,278
want to hear your guys opinions because

279
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,560
you've been growing my seeds a little

280
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,448
bit do the s-1 seem to marry their

281
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,869
parents a little bit more than the r and

282
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:52,769
the regular brush gently I bet how many

283
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:55,230
things like s horns like I had things

284
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:57,720
like I can't remember what it was but it

285
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,950
came out so different but so much like

286
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,840
it's like our one of his original pair

287
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,520
here comes at the Kabletown I think it

288
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,259
might have been the kaepa bunch of kids

289
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,699
and seats I'm gonna tell everybody that

290
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:08,439
Spence is actually who threw down that

291
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,509
white widow female that I use in the

292
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,220
Kabletown cross so that I brothers thank

293
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:13,600
you we're attributed so I gave him the

294
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,580
first handful of seeds i made out of

295
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,040
that to run for me just to say thanks

296
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,930
but yeah i saw that in the pictures i

297
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,279
could see the grateful dawg even if you

298
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,649
knew that it was that white widow mom

299
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,689
you could see her [ __ ] it all yeah I've

300
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,269
got buddies running it now and I can

301
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,070
look at them from you know four or five

302
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:32,799
weeks after they've been planted and you

303
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:34,990
can see in the structure and then in the

304
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,659
Leafs edge like what parent is related

305
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,159
to yeah sure not related to but close is

306
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:41,019
leaning toward you can almost tell them

307
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,399
keep that one full that 1i I'm getting

308
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,199
good with but the shirt I've read I'm

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,539
getting real sure with that shadow to

310
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,250
bigger lover bigger lover is growing as

311
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,409
you shoot it out of some cables my boss

312
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,210
he makes dank water hash and grows thats

313
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:56,079
train like a pro so good work bro thanks

314
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:58,720
for doing much my seed to justice what

315
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,660
is a your experience with destitute it's

316
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,810
a compared to say it f to a speedo mine

317
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:06,639
answer ah so the ass ones come out i

318
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:08,469
would say fifty percent of them look

319
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,299
like mommy and then the other 50 are a

320
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,070
little weird I mean that's not to say

321
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,299
for a breeder but they say you get a

322
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,000
mutant some [ __ ] when you do that for

323
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:18,009
sure you're putting it's not a natural

324
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,169
its cousin [ __ ] essentially nothing

325
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:21,639
it's not I know I'm not supposed to say

326
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,079
that word of the podcast anymore but

327
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,899
there's no better way to put that it

328
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,480
that's cousin [ __ ] good as to come

329
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,730
out even more uniform I'm gonna remedy

330
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,470
maybe seventy percent more uniform I'm

331
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,029
not the mathematician and I didn't keep

332
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,639
good enough notes i guess but they're

333
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:38,799
even more uniform I if once you get into

334
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,299
that and I didn't realize I was doing

335
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,129
something unique when I was doing it I

336
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:44,889
took the same grateful dawg of the

337
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:47,230
original female and Kate kepta taken to

338
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,879
clone and were using that reversed

339
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,320
female to make seeds again and then

340
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,480
making another generation almost

341
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,790
inbreeding it and I've gotten it so far

342
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,070
that those come out like clothes those

343
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:58,689
graceful dog sees notice that as for

344
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,310
generation I think it's kind of what it

345
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,420
would be I don't know a lot of people

346
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:03,729
that have done it so don't know how to

347
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:05,259
label it that's more she doesn't come

348
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,090
out there like clones of each other

349
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:09,009
growing seeds from clause which is kind

350
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,560
of nice for a breeder to achieve nfm and

351
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:12,779
I see yeah for sure those aren't out of

352
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,039
the market yet guys that's not

353
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,990
you're getting yeah I haven't made

354
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,779
enough of them to check but yeah he go

355
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:22,129
get him eventually it would be very

356
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:24,299
popular yeah that's gonna be very cool I

357
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:26,159
don't know anybody has gotten that far

358
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:28,169
you always find a weird [ __ ] yeah and I

359
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,969
see that's why I asked because I don't

360
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:33,479
think I've ever grown in s2 that i know

361
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:36,870
of so you know this diver I've grown up

362
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,000
to like after year f4 and so but you

363
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:42,419
know if s yeah how FAR's you mate if you

364
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,879
don't mind me askin bx3 a beautiful

365
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:49,009
Kenya so i'm at the point i don't know

366
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:52,259
if i want to back cross it one more time

367
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:55,889
because i'm pretty happy with what what

368
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:58,019
i got from it or if I want to start in

369
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:02,759
crossing it and start making I guess

370
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:05,309
would be a f1 f2 generation you know and

371
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,169
so on what percentage of those seeds now

372
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:10,649
are coming out to be what you have in

373
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:12,659
mind well there's there's two different

374
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,299
phenotypes and I really like to boa so

375
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,549
he got to Leah and identifying there

376
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,799
were some less desirable phenotypes and

377
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:22,729
I worked them out I believe on the bx to

378
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:26,759
generation when i made the trees so

379
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:30,170
industries of just the one phenotype a

380
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:32,730
call one night stand and it's a [ __ ]

381

real but you know as a Kim dog

386

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:53,759
Kim D a little bit like diesel a little

388
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,320
bit more more more unique thing or not

389
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,049
unique but different things slightly

390
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,120

not that far record no no this one was

442
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,820
written the early eighties but the title

443
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,310
is how to grow or in the first chapter

444
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,310
two how to grow a million pounds of

445
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:59,009
skunk weed or some water yeah but

446
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:03,719

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,409
of reach right now so we'll just keep

450
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,809
the conversation rolling for sure my

451
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,750
favorite is at this point in my life is

452
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:17,819
google so you got to sort through a lot

453
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,039
of [ __ ] but you learn where the

454
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:23,318
reliable sources are and when you see

455
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,908
one of their articles pop up you know

456
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:26,408
and most of the time I think they're

457
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:29,110
probably referencing all these great

458
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:30,970
books so hopefully and guys if you read

459
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:32,798
some stuff on google read three or four

460
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,538
articles on google yeah yeah think about

noticeable you'll know if you've got it

545
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,929
about 20 days into flour you can tell

546
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,490
turn off the grow lights and turn on the

547
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:49,350
normal eyes and look from the underside

548
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,259
of the calyx and you'll see the purple

549
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:55,678
for sure yeah I do get that flows go to

550
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:57,960
coastal known phenotypes yeah I'll pj

551
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,970
shorts move DJ short says that he put

552
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,919
that flow out that he released that

553
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,259
clone that's in Colorado he said he left

554

possible with those seats what the

556
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:10,109
potential of flow was so that cut that

557

from canada for so many years boot time

568
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,950
I'm not touching that one I didn't make

569
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:38,589
fun of anybody you got some to say it's

570
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,630
been to do it no y'all leaned up on the

571
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:42,009
mic like you're ready to go home and I'm

572
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,190
going to return to read your question so

573
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:47,230
I could thank you some cheer to say do

574
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,210
you when you grow out of the pack this

575
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,170
is why is variation happening and useful

576
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,490
we talked about kind of why it's

577
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,320
happening because we're bringing a male

578
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,910
and a female and now they're making

579
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,379
babies and we don't want all the babies

580
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,840
to look the same in the world that's how

581
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,240
plants survive so how do you find that

582
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:04,480
variation to be useful do you want that

583
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,370
stuff do I want you wanna she knows yet

584
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,279
I mean difference between is gives you

585
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:10,689
you know you know if we talked about on

586
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,269
a previous episode we talked about how

587
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,269
many is penis you should keep in a seat

588
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:17,349
pack so you know that's where you would

589
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:19,509
want to keep a couple different

590
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:21,639
especially if it's a seat pack that is a

591
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:24,190
hybrid you know something like that

592
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,910
where you can get multiple variations of

593
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,410
your parents um so I enjoy you know the

594
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,480
different variations like some plants

595
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,570
grow faster some plants you know have

596
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,339
more side branching rule if it goes like

597
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:38,379
that yes I branching you know some

598
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:41,980
plants grow straight up and some plants

599
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,230
actually the bottoms grow almost as good

600
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,390
as the top though yeah you know those

601
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,849

could go from seed every single time but

649
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,890
i have some other plans i have to

650
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,470
maintain and you know best way to do

651
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:35,080
that is clone and run clones and you

652
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,089
know he's making la distancia yeah

653
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,259
that's again get your liable medicine

654
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:40,869
freeze the patients and that's what we

655
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:43,779
only I'm a this winter i'm planning on

656
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:46,449
growing pretty much exclusively seed so

657
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,129
other than just mother maintenance so

658
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,080
have you ever ran a whole pack of seeds

659
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:54,430
and not gotten anything worth keeping

660
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:56,019
yes me to you yes you're running you

661
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:58,029
your shops got a nice amount of feeds

662
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:00,069
going right now and I bet you've got

663
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,569
high hopes for that there's a lot of

664
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:03,490
different ones going on in there too so

665
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,929
it's very sad if you don't find a couple

666
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,120
of keepers of each one it's going to

667
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,140
feel like a lot of work for nothing

668
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:09,369
already it's looking like there's a

669
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,350
couples that are setting themselves

670
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,839
apart from the others so it's pretty

671
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:16,899
promising and how many how many days in

672
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,970
are those they are there in veg still so

673
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,320

679
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,009
dubs what yeah oh my gad comically why i

680
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,759
don't know

681
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:36,769
efficient i think if this might be a

682
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,359
friendly the personal challenge person

683
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,769
that's a turn we were i was talking on

684
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:42,559
an episode it might have been the last

685
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:44,599
one that i'm going to put the gigantic

686
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,759
dab thing to arrest for myself because

687
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,009
I'm getting old on the highway oh you

688
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,930
know any thought that you I'm rough yeah

689
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:52,910
it takes a little bit of effort it kind

690
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,380
of if you uh if you do in the

691
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,750
mid-afternoon and you don't applying it

692
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,490
right you can ruin your whole day how

693
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,349
many times you can do a gram dab and

694
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,240
survive you know i said i think what i

695
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:03,799
actually said was in my lungs I realized

696
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,930
my lungs have so many inhales and

697
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,669
exhales and I think taking a gram dab

698
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,950
it's just like you're just using up cat

699
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,660
lives when you do that that was building

700
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,120
to bless you could have had but instead

701
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,100
you smoke a gram of hash that's kind of

702
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:20,679
how I feel about it or the road you're

703
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:24,139
gonna wait 30 tuberous breasts breasts I

704
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:27,769
don't waste any breath especially that

705
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,870
many but I mean what better way to do it

706
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:31,609
then taking the hit hash at least you

707
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:32,929
weren't breathing in concrete dust or

708
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:35,539
some you know i've done that before--not

709
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:40,910
more a be better than ask them like yeah

710
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:42,049
definitely prefer the dad and yeah why

711
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,120
that means it got really loud for a

712
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,230
second that might have been my fault you

713
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,939
guys want to give a shout out to this

714
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,519

715
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:52,670

because I'm dabbed out what else do we

722
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,200

723
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:11,029
guys ok I got a question I like you

724
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:15,769
super cool what is water bags feet

725
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:17,899
consider like CT find in like mostly s1

726
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:20,059
so you would say they had considered as

727
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,530
you don't know the parents yeah yeah

728
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:23,240
it's probably just an [ __ ] what if

729
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,339
well you know the parent if it you get

730
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,259
the seeds out of them but you don't know

731
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:28,970
what the mail was yeah I'm playing in

732
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:32,329
the fall underwater video have you ever

733
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:34,490
heard of points like all right so why we

734
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:36,589
having yeah slightly harming and seeding

735
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,250
the plant and then taking the seat from

736
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:40,859
there and growing that

737
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,960
with that that's a nice one okay that's

738
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:45,179
how soma sorry someone spilling your

739
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,950
beans that's how silma actually makes

740
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,440
feminized seeds he takes a female and

741
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,670
flowers are for too long and then after

742
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,620
she goes like if you got a nine-week

743
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,390
strain he lets it go for 13 in about

744
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,309
week center Tino start Pitts Pitts not

745
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,840
fallen and then he gathers that and

746
00:27:56,309 --> 00:28:00,690
throws it on the next crop that he makes

747
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,609
her car so didn't have you jerk oh then

748
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,170
he says you can smoke those buds to if

749
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:05,519
you can go down most of the plant just

750
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:08,039
leave enough of it to her him out and

751
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,359
spit out fallen let me smoke the wrestle

752
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,009
even if you can't smoke it you could

753
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,990
definitely probably distract it there

754
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:16,049
you go yeah have you heard of his a fire

755
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:18,029
technique oh yeah I'm stressed plants

756
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:21,240
out yeah that's a little weird to me

757
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,859
yeah makes sense I mean I guess I

758
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,299
understand this theory sitting on dad

759
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:26,250
where he's coming from foot the forest

760
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:29,129
fire my man is that is more organic than

761
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,950
mine yeah that's a pretty hardcore do

762
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,660
yeah you don't want to smoke the flowers

763
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,279
of the plants that I have reversed you

764
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,200
don't want to smoke those you can smoke

765
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,059
is for sure if you don't want to smoke

766
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,069
mine i don't think i would i would

767
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:42,539
encourage it yeah yeah they've been

768
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:47,039
sprayed with chemicals that I don't

769
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:48,839

could be an f2 you could experience

775
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,269
transgressive segregation it could

776
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,620
outperform its parent like that you

777
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:05,970

811
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,859

812
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,090
projects right now Jessie yes what do

813
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:33,719
you got going on in here and your

814
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:38,159
project and I am I guess and I'm really

815
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,420
happy with bx3 of depot dog so I think

816
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,269
I'm gonna make a whole bunch of feet of

817
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:46,710
it and maybe get it to the public so

818
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:49,529
we'll see I no way you can make that

819
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,090
happen yeah yeah all right don't let the

820
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:54,440
crosses on the depot dodge again so they

821
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:59,899
can get him excited it's a old school

822
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:03,900
Amsterdam I don't really have a lot of

823
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:05,519
heritage on it but it's a I don't know

824
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,100
the producer of it but it was asked in

825
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,470
case I believe it was a freebie from an

826
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:13,439
old amsterdam feedback but had really

827
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:17,970
really hurt early resin production and

828
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:21,450
it was a gun case so the initial reason

829
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:23,460
i used to din the cross was he was very

830
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:26,340
different than Kim D and it was very

831
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,160
easy to spot out the phenotypes of

832
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:31,679
remaining garter towards him so I kind

833
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,080
of used it as a tool to make the Kim

834
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,120
line more pewter so glad that Kim was

835
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,829

916
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:15,019
everybody if you have timers that have

917
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:16,460
more than one program make sure you go

918
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:19,909
through your programs and make sure

919
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,679
there's no extra timers chillin so it's

920
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:24,949
cool you can catch it but I call it

921
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,469
thank god you almost flower huh did you

922
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:29,960
almost oh I was almost run coward I'm

923
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:32,389
with almost all our dog [ __ ] so I had it

924
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,829
like well I was my room some plants look

925
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:35,779
good so I don't really know like its I

926
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:37,760
saw a wrong timer but it was just weird

927
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,599
because there was no off timer just on

928
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,650
but I've been in my room and it's not on

929
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,140
I'm doing with those fancy digital

930
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,789
timers yeah I'm going so when you reset

931
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:48,618
your time a guy just reset it the whole

932
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:50,599
day like yeah just hit reset and clear

933
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:52,430
it out don't just try to go and re-set

934
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:54,980
everything actually hit the button

935
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:56,449
default that [ __ ] but I think they'll

936
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,889
be fun i've got a couple that are just

937
00:35:56,449 --> 00:36:00,460
growing right through it and it didn't

938
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:02,960
matter to it so kind of happy with those

939
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,778
why Harley what life cycle are you

940
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,179
running you doing the 12

941
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:09,708
dreamtone philosophers that's actually a

942
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:11,088
good way to stress attached your plants

943
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:13,009
i was mentioning this this is a since

944
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:14,328
our fee no topic kind of got side well

945
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:18,108
here we ran out of [ __ ] to talk about i

946
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:19,969
think i stress test my plants before i

947
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:21,828
read with them i'll take a female and

948
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,208
put it in a real i'll take a bunch of

949
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:24,349
them like I've got four or five new

950
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:26,688
clones I'll put them in the room and

951
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:28,849
I'll run it on 12 12 for two weeks and

952
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:31,548
then about day 15 I'll turn it off for

953
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:33,349
24 hours day 15 will turn it on for 24

954
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:35,298
hours and then I'll put it back on the

955
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:36,650
opposite 12 12 so if I was coming on to

956
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:38,568
tennis before you know I'm coming on at

957
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,099
ten at night and I'll run that for a few

958
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:41,958
more days you know just watch them grow

959
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:43,699
they'll kind of freak out and then I'll

960
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:46,578
put it back into the normal flower cycle

961
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:49,459
and that really pisses off normal time

962
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:51,109
and you will be a lot of things start to

963
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:53,509
throw nanners and be that her mattress

964
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:55,489
we wish mulund earlier and don't do with

965
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:56,239
them if they throw those bananas on you

966
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,708
because those are going to be

967
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,170
hermaphrodites in the future though

968
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:02,568
cause you can reach your passion some

969

same goes for mouth but I don't want to

970
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:06,139
give away too many secrets so we'll just

971
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:08,630
leave it at that I like a yourself yeah

972
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:10,608
male stuff is all that's all proprietary

973
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:13,209
stuff that you keep on the down low well

974
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:15,318
give them that you know what people

975
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:18,678
breeding with a bunch of hard as nails

976
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:20,630
now or the females you know yeah you can

977
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:21,979
usually spot a nice firms male the top

978
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,358
clusters are too close together this

979
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:25,518
looks like they got fur between us it's

980
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:28,548
start to look like like a [ __ ] willow

981
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:30,318
or something a fox tail sort of turned

982
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:32,059

this is being a Piru alright that is

993
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:02,450
fire and plastic he just puts it down

994
00:38:00,048 --> 00:38:04,550
like I already know how this [ __ ] ends

995
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:11,598
in the [ __ ] outside turn at the house

997
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,140
going for a long we've been at it for 35

998
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:16,489
minutes you guys got anything you want

999
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:21,920
to talk about on a podcast anything

1000
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:23,179
you've ever wanted to say no everyone

1001
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,940
just kind of shakes their head and goes

1002
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:27,500
nah bro we're good I just have one side

1003
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,550
note back to the the faint no hunting

1004
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,170
that's good because that's what

1005
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,390
everybody came to the show for I was it

1006
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,700
was one big thing I look for is I grow

1007
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:36,650
mostly indoors so I liked I plants that

1008
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:39,439
respond well to topping and super

1009
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,660
cropping I get a nice even canopy versus

1010
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,480
having a lot of lower growth and certain

1011
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:47,358
trains really don't like topping well I

1012
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,789
remember purple subs phenotypic

1013
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,289
expression that is a very see no

1014
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:56,809
physical expression so things like

1015
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:58,820
purpling ah even some strange kind of it

1016
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:00,949
because if you have an unhealthy plants

1017
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,660
that have purple stems to right but but

1018
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:04,608
i have seen healthy plants it's just a

1019
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:07,279
purple booms girl scout cookies program

1020
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:09,318

1031
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,940
then backed up from the microphone aback

1032
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:41,379
down or enough for now all right you

1033
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:43,700
don't have to say it I don't know okay

1034
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,960
the notes are done bro we said all the

1035
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:47,899
stuff on my notes you're looking over

1036
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,730
here like what can we say yes I'm you're

1037
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:53,150
thinking like a press pause well you

1038
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:55,880
think don't be ascared to kill your red

1039
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:57,588
hair bird oh yeah did you guys hear that

1040
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,119
Michaels taking a daddy said don't be

1041
00:39:57,588 --> 00:40:01,789
afraid to kill off those plants that are

1042
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,710
not performing that server ID and when I

1043
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:06,588
do free notes i should start full fino

1044
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:08,630
hunts i usually do probably like a

1045
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:10,519
couple feet back strap just woolen um

1046
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:13,670
and it's kind of survival of the fittest

1047
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:15,409
or Mises seeds I'd like to not really

1048
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,019
like feed him too much I kind of like to

1049
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,759
just let him

1050
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:19,199
see which ones are going to do their

1051
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,810
thing until I have to start you know

1052
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,609
giving a food until yeah like I kill

1053
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:25,469
ones that if you're if it's going to get

1054
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,750
over grown as a seat it's probably going

1055
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:29,759
to get over grown as a plant so I just

1056
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,960
get rid of it right um and there's

1057
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,060
nothing wrong with getting rid of that

1058
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,369
just makes your hunt smaller more now

1059
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:37,380
you can focus on other things instead of

1060
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:39,059
now you have one less plant yeah like

1061
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,559
picking players for the team you don't

1062
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:41,880
want those slow runners or the guy that

1063
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,250
can't shoot you don't want me on your

1064

1094
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,769
but I'm not certain take it with heat

1095
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:54,719
and change the colors don't attend a

1096
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:57,150
rainbow color when you'd be a little

1097
00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:00,059
more variation in it I believe if it was

1098
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:02,579
the process I'll ask him so that way we

1099
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:05,219
know since I oh yeah that's anodized I

1100

potheads I know we tried to have a

1116
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,050
phenotype discussion it feels like we

1117
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:50,610
covered a lot see if we can name off any

1118

00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:23,179
that is from a very popular breeder

1153
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:25,699
i recently lost my flow strain access

1154
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:28,219

1158
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:40,010
grew DNA genetic Holy Grail khush for

1159
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,720
the scene and it was fire if you guys

1160

00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:49,519
down it tastes like stinky gunky feet

1163
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:52,190
it's harder to grow it's a [ __ ] to grow

1164
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,539
and it will not clone i try i gave cuts

1165
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,780
to other people they couldn't get it to

1166
00:44:53,539 --> 00:45:00,070
clone but that stuff was awesome DNA

1167
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:03,470
genetics holy grail cush I just wouldn't

1168
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:05,030
I've got a pack of it there's yeah he

1169
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:08,089
just released a whole bunch of them I

1170
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:13,220
think but well I had a lemon skunk that

1171

uh from uh from arion yeah sure hit hit

1172
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:17,480
hit I want to go to name him but like

1173
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,700
there's a good phenotype that's what I

1174
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,869
wanted to get me with oh okay yeah

1175
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:24,679
Duncan voltage we had the DNA one foot I

1176
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:30,980
think they're pretty much the same thing

1177
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:32,960
anybody seen okay so would notice the

1178
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,730
stupid question we show recording we're

1179
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,840
still totally record okay I'll ask the

1180
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,340
student question anyway but I'll

1181
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,380
knowledge if you don't know the NC

1182
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:44,180
you'll know it's over oh no I pages to a

1183
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:47,090
question so oh geez are not a phenotype

1184
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:49,690
they are like it would be a clue in

1185
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:52,190
Jinan sorry okay yeah yeah for sure

1186
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:55,070
lately I think og is just a sticker

1187
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:58,789
using been three or a seat breeder for

1188
00:45:55,070 --> 00:46:01,460
dollar signs very well boat yeah I say

1189
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:03,860
every true oh geez like two came out

1190
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:07,280
I'll Chico she had the original ones

1191
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:08,660
those who locker yeah from according to

1192
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,789
the story there's a buncha turn the

1193
00:46:08,659 --> 00:46:13,159
phenotypes of the genotype poll

1194
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:16,819
I don't know I underdog that's a good

1195
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:19,159
story that I really think there's two

1196
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:22,938
underdogs and both of them are pretty

1197
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:24,618
well known so I you guys got it speaking

1198

settle down nice shout-out lopata yeah

1265
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:18,670
yeah I haven't been back in 13 years

1266
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:21,009
regrettably every summer I plan a trip

1267
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:22,539
over there and never happens but I'm

1268
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:24,429
totally going through theatre show up

1269
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:27,400
when I do get over there it's hard to do

1270
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:30,068
it being an outdoor farmer yeah yeah

1271
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,588
yeah long drive Jesse brought me some

1272
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:34,778
eggs and I cracked open one of those

1273
00:49:32,588 --> 00:49:36,969
eggs and it almost freaked me out

1274
00:49:34,778 --> 00:49:40,179
because the you know he's not crazy do

1275
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:43,358
it old man it was like two times three

1276
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:46,509
times like really think it's supposed to

1277
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:48,818
do and they taste so much better like

1278
00:49:46,509 --> 00:49:50,259
your eggs make me nauseous when I eat

1279
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:53,139
them like oh god I can't believe I

1280
00:49:50,259 --> 00:49:55,989
decided to cook this preferment ooh yeah

1281
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:57,879
for me Jesse's eggs taste like food and

1282
00:49:55,989 --> 00:50:00,309
maybe like a reals to be eating it and

1283
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,108

you're vegetarian there's like four

1326
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:40,600
spots that's what I really feel bad for

1327
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:42,130
you just cook didn't register yeah makes

1328
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,079
you just cook at home makes me want to

1329
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,210
open a vegetarian restaurant Oh some of

1330
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,920
us would appreciate that put a little

1331
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,260
slower look backward over there and see

1332
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,389
what I'm doing back there and no bother

1333
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:55,480
me between bringing me place of food and

1334
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:58,569
the office yeah just call the place the

1335
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,309
office it'd be hard to in the winter and

1336
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:01,510
be hard for me to have a vegetarian

1337
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:05,829
restaurant because I just be so

1338
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:07,990
disappointed by the Proteas yeah any

1339
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:11,679
organic vegetables would be really huh

1340
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:13,299
no wonder yeah yeah wonder if we could

1341
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,099
grow some vegetables I think that's

1342
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,720
probably one of the downsides of the

1343
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:18,190
cannabis industry now if you want to

1344
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:19,719
build a greenhouse there's certain

1345
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:21,429
you're going to grow weed in it like 1

1346
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:24,609
million dollars yeah you know it's

1347
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:28,690
actually not that I'm shut my retirement

1348
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:31,329
plan is but not for the cannabis and

1349
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:36,639

1351
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:39,578
like the music part i can say yeah a

1352
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:41,798
long time

1353
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:43,599

1354
