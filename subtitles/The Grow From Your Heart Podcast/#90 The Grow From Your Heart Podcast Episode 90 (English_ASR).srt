good friend Jessie all right guys I am

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,060

me is our good buddy Jessie how you

66
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,000
doing today Braille pretty good pretty

67
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,170
good man thanks for coming I know you've

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,110
been a busy man so it's always good

69
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:30,089
haven't yet it's a grower season it is

70
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,260
farmer season so you guys I just thrown

71
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,849
the microphones real quick we were gonna

72
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,959
do a podcast and then Jesse mentioned

73
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,539
something and I was like I'm gonna hit

74
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,959
record Jesse just said if you were using

75
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:42,539
general organics to not adjust the pH

76
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,580
when you're done I completely agree with

77
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:48,870
that then what did you say to use to

78
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,820
adjust the pH if you had to oh nothing I

79
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,450
was saying it's built into the formula

80
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:58,289
the the CA mag plus or calculus that it

81
00:02:54,449 --> 00:03:00,599
is they have it's a pH buffer I'm not

82
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:03,449
exactly sure on the entire science of it

83
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,090
but I do know for a fact that uh if you

84
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,859
try to pH it will mess your [ __ ] up you

85
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,629
have some funky looking plants right

86
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,489
well because if you're using organics

87
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,229
it's already it's organic and if you go

88
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,700
import acids in there that we're using I

89
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:16,289
think it's a phosphoric acid which is

90
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,649
the pH down I don't remember exactly

91
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:21,090
what it is but the word acid in there

92
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,709
yeah that tells you that it's gonna go

93
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,900
there and start destroying all of your

94
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,709
organics in your micro life all right

95
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,909
well I just wanted to get that on

96
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,349
recording guys since we were talking

97
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,729
about it sometimes the best [ __ ] comes

98
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,439
out before I turn on the microphone so

99
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:32,759
he's filling damn I wasted some time

100
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,780
there so I just wanted to put on the

101
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,039
mics and get that on there

102
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,330
Jesse welcome to the show my friend

103
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,859
thanks for coming I really appreciate

104
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,900
you having here bro yeah thanks for

105
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,489
having me all right I'm all choked up

106
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,709
from some dads let's get official I

107
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,489
invited Jesse over to do a podcast and

108
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:50,340
my topic was our friend John Rossum on

109
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:53,670
periscope asked if he can grow his bag

110
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,799
seeds the short answer is hell yes you

111
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,649
can grow your bag seeds we've got a

112
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,659
really long answer also one thing I want

113
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,730
to mention though a lot of the older

114
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,219
cats that I try to pitch my seeds to are

115
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:07,979
flabbergasted and blown away by the

116
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,599
price of a 10 pack of seeds lately a 10

117
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,129
pack of seeds will go anyway it depends

118
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,629
on the breeder anywhere from fifty to a

119
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:17,129
hundred bucks for a ten pack of good

120
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:20,728
regular or feminized boys are doing 180

121
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:22,139
now for a ten pack of seeds okay yeah

122
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,089
some of these higher known companies are

123
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,159
definitely able to get more money 150 to

124
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,149
200 bucks for a pack of seeds now a lot

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,979
of people are gonna say what

126
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:30,959
hell and then some of these old guys

127
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:33,180
they say but dude I've got a big baggie

128
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,039
of seeds in my closet from when I used

129
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,819
to smoke pot and sift it out on a record

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,919
cover on an album cover those seeds are

131
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,659
great I recommend you grow those but do

132
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,668
not try to sell those the reason they

133
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,500
aren't sellable the reason that the

134
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:48,599
seeds US breeders are selling and

135
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,579
pushing and promoting the reason they

136
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,990
cost more money is because we know what

137
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,579
the parents are we know what's gonna

138
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,710
come from those seeds we've done time

139
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,560
selecting the male and female to produce

140
00:04:55,709 --> 00:05:00,599
a seed line that has probably gone

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,879
several years in testing and development

142
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,699
to figure out what we want know Herms

143
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,319
high-quality yea and consistency is

144
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,478
something I really know her a lot of

145
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,009
quality good resin production good

146
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:12,930
flowering time there are some plants

147
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,029
when you get them I've worked strains

148
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,650
down from 90-day flowering times by

149
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:19,589
breeding it into other things we've cut

150
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:21,448
it down by breeding several times we've

151
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,038
brought it to sixty days and it's still

152
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,660
pretty much the same plant all we've

153
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,500
done is breed it to shorter flowering

154
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,180
plants put it to the flo grow the seeds

155
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,610
that come from that out find the one

156
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,990
that's a lot like the original male or

157
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,788
female whichever we were trying to do

158
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,490
and then put that back to flow because

159
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,870
flow is a quick plant so we just bred

160
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,418
seems to flow and sped it up a little

161
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,408
bit it passes on traits really well too

162
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,879
yes she does

163
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:46,709
so if you guys were looking to start a

164
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,240
breeding project get a Colorado flow and

165
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,649
play with her because that's a fun one

166
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,509
to breed with but what I'm getting at is

167
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,339
those bagged seeds that these older cats

168
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:55,168
or maybe you younger cats have the

169
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,719
reason those aren't marketable and

170
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:59,098
sellable is because you don't know the

171
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,110
parents you don't know the genetic

172
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:02,939
heritage of them so they are not a

173
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,598
marketable seed but you can definitely

174
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:05,610
give them away

175
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:08,728
you can definitely grow the [ __ ] out of

176
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,919
them grow your bag seed you can have

177
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:11,969
hermaphrodites you guys you could have a

178
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,908
bunch of males

179
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:18,180
you could have shitty-ass ragweed but

180
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:20,610
you could you very well could have so

181
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,769
sorry no go for yeah I see looking good

182
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,650
Jesse's getting excited over here dog

183
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:27,329
I'm stoned I can barely [ __ ] yeah you

184
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:29,339
just you just blurt it out exactly the

185
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:31,469
stray dog came from Tim dog who was

186
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,149
[ __ ] bagsied Kim dog is known as one

187
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,680
of the strongest strains on earth it's

188
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:36,418
been on the cover of High Times Magazine

189
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,879
three or four times is the single

190
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,930
strongest strain on earth but also that

191
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,449
was Old Betsy

192
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,180
and stain strains were you know this is

193
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,530
a really deep discussion yes yeah yeah

194
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,300
we could get way into the chem no it

195
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,948
wasn't just a bunch of junk strains back

196
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,770
then you know I mean I'm sure there was

197
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,660
but you know that's what chances are if

198
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,519
somebody grew if you bought that bag of

199
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,350
weed and it had a seed and their chances

200
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,758
are it was decent week yeah you know

201
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,500
what I'm saying the only thing is we

202
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,699
don't know what it was it was a lot of

203
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,110
people back in the day don't even know

204
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,939
what the girl plant they got or what the

205
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,710
buds they got were they want to say this

206
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,329
is like Acapulco gold or something but

207
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,799
it was just whatever that dude said it

208
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,529
was it was before we really knew and

209
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,949
cared a lot about genetics yeah yeah and

210
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:19,198
then also on things you could get you

211
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:22,169
could even get Mexican autoflowering you

212
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,120
never know good and some people want

213
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:25,500
those Mexican autoflowering plans some

214
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,060
people would love to have that some

215
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,310
people people message me all the time

216
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,800
asking when I'm gonna make OTO flowers

217
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,120
this wasn't that's that's my answer this

218
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,620
was never supposed to be about my brand

219
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,569
or my company but I read genetics will

220
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,340
never make auto flowering plants I don't

221
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:40,589
believe in uh the use of auto flowering

222
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:43,649
I'm actually straying far away from

223
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:45,929
feminized seeds because I like the males

224
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:49,168
in the population I think that we need

225
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,550
male plants and feminized seeds they

226
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:53,279
don't provide can't make it enough

227
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,259
feminized seeds to Glary do yeah they

228
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,269
want so many of them damn things so

229
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,589
Jesse hit the head hit that nail right

230
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,448
on the head when he said you could have

231
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:03,869
the next chem dog chem dog came from

232
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:06,419
bagsied two dudes sold the guy a bag of

233
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,840
weed on a Grateful Dead parking lot in

234
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:12,060
95 I think it was chem dog found seeds

235
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,739
in that weed and he grew that [ __ ] and

236
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,439
out of one of those seeds and you guys

237
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,449
go google the legend of chem dog in the

238
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,310
13 beans if you're listening to this

239
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:21,598
podcast and you want to be deep into the

240
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,030
cannabis culture and you want to know

241
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,668
some heritage google chem dog and the

242
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:28,168
legend of the 13 beans and also I got to

243
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:30,769
give a big shout out to the Adam Dunn

244
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:33,838
show a podcast they do an entire episode

245
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:36,059
where chem dog actually calls in and

246
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,010
they discuss where this stream came from

247
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,809
a lot a lot of the people that were in

248
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,028
the chain of that and everything and

249
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,949
they all college people were on the old

250
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:45,929
school forums if any of the listeners

251
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,970
are forum junkies you know if they

252
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:49,019
already know the story but well I'm

253
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,139
gonna write this down one day we're

254
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,129
gonna have to talk about og and if OD

255
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,539

258
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,620
said oh gee I'm over girl yeah you meant

259
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,970
overgrowth the website overgrown calm it

260
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,919
was a website that we used to frequent

261
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,420
and talk about growing cannabis sub cool

262
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,149
was on there all the cool breeders were

263
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:11,539
on there everyone and there's uh there's

264
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,949
a theory that the OG Kush came from

265
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:15,599
overgrow but also people think it's the

266
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,820
Original Gangster I've also heard it

267
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,139
ocean grown we'll talk about that on

268
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,350
this show in the future we need a few

269
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,480
more

270
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,370
oh geez on the show to come talk with us

271
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,509
on that one all right so grow out those

272
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,269
bag seeds because you could have chem

273
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,639
dog you guys you could also have junk

274
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:33,659
you could totally have junk there's a

275
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,169
little pet peeve don't sell clones a

276
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:36,839
junk

277
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:39,179
yeah I'm in Colorado don't do that yet

278
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,210
grow it out if you don't sell your junky

279
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,370
seeds from your junkie clones it's

280
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,960
really rude it is rude it's

281
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,460
disrespectful to your customers it's

282
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,310
disrespectful to your patients it's

283
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,470
disrespectful to the plant itself it's

284
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,929
disrespectful to the future of cannabis

285
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,029
yeah if you grow a plant and you take

286
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,769
clones of it don't give those clones out

287
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,360
until you have flowered the damn plant

288
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:03,240
and you verified that it's something

289
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,070
worthwhile there are so many strains

290
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,789
available grow something worthwhile if

291
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:10,350
it's not as a breeder it is so hard to

292
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:12,179
breathe something and then grow 100

293
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,820
seeds and realize that you have just

294
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:17,639
created [ __ ] hemp I think this strain

295
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,290
doesn't do us any good I've got 6,000

296
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,360
seeds of it and all I'm going to do is

297
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:22,799
feed them to some birds because I don't

298
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,259
want anybody growing this I've got one

299
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,589
cross that there's a lemon cush idea and

300
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,360
dude it grew the fattest chunky Astellas

301
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,210
nuggets they were bigger than my arms

302
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,000
they didn't have any flavor or any resin

303
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,550
it just grew the biggest hemp ever is

304
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,620
terrible so you know I have horrible

305
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:42,779
hemming problems in all my own drives me

306
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,610
nuts and your breeding projects yeah oh

307
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,159
man because that's so much of its

308
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,529
involved with Kim dog so yeah Kim does

309
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,429
have a tendency to herm in there see so

310
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,709
you guys got to find if you're gonna

311
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:55,409
breed with Kim dog make sure you uh back

312
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,720
cross or out cross that Hermia trait go

313
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:59,639
find a solid progeny to solid progeny

314
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,870
from your F ones and work those yeah I'm

315
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,460
just going ahead of myself here

316
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,470
alright so sometimes it's hard to guess

317
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,759
what pollinated the seeded buds that

318
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,769
you've got

319
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,879
but you know that that female makes

320
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,129
quality medicine

321
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,529
so maybe the donor was a male in the

322
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,179
room maybe something harmed but it's

323
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:16,799
probably just a stress seed it's usually

324
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,870
a light leak or something like that is

325
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,120
what's causing these bags we're doing a

326
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,639
lot of overdue regular watering

327
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,289
yeah surprises surprises on the plants

328
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,460
definitely if you get them too hot let

329
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:29,549
them get too dry they'll start at

330
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:33,300
throwing out seeds a seed is the plant's

331
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:34,679
response of oh [ __ ] the plant goes you

332
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,409
know what I think I'm gonna die here

333
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,179
soon and it's only only it's like a

334
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:41,969
horny person it just wants to reproduce

335
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:44,009
that's the plan mole mission yeah just

336
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,240
to reproduce the resin is there to

337
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,889
protect the plant so that it can

338
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,259
reproduce the pistils which everybody

339
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,669
calls hairs those are there to collect

340
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,559
pollen so that it can reproduce

341
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,019
everything is all about these plants

342
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,399
reproducing so if you piss off a plant

343
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,360
it will try to make a seed as a reaction

344
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,769
it just wants to make sure that it

345
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,620
continues it doesn't want to wiped out

346
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:06,000
main job in life yeah that is its job

347
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,220
yeah so that's its purpose is to

348
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,940
reproduce and continue tricking it in

349
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,980
many ways so be respectful to yeah you

350
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,740
know I think I had a list of which

351
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,080
strains were they are gorilla glue

352
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,899
number four and seven all the gorilla

353
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,910
glue strains were actually like bagsied

354
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,679
accidental paulo nations that created

355
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,629
seeds that Josey Wales shout-out to

356
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,929
Josey Wales a grower slash breeder oh

357
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:32,730
yeah or good accident happy accident

358
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:36,179
we're glad that happened thanks for

359
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:38,759
popping those beans golden goat one of

360
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,859
Colorado's most popular strains ever one

361
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,750
of my most popular strains for my

362
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,919
growing my photography you guys a lot of

363
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,990
people give me credit for breeding

364
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,209
golden goat I'm gonna say right now I

365
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,340
did not breed the golden go golden goat

366
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,009
was bred by a guy known as mr. dink in

367
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:56,580
Topeka Kansas yep and it was an accident

368
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:58,490
that was not meant to happen Jesse's

369
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,520
headphones are cutting out here I do

370
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,960
cool I got you all right guys I think

371
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,309
we're back I think we recorded all the

372
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,490
first part - I'm pretty sure we're using

373
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:09,929
the zoom h6 handy recorder today and I'm

374
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,870
pretty sure I recorded that first part

375
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:15,809
so better take a quick break edge this

376
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,870
uh live wire solutions a chayo for 4

377
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:20,279
channel stereo headphone amplifier it's

378
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,220
going to get a hammer put to it pretty

379
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:24,569
here because it just pisses me off

380
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,090
though I think we were on golden goat

381
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,100
goat I was saying that I did not breed

382
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,769
the golden go right that was mr. ding

383
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,139
mr. dink red dad Kansas of all places I

384
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,759
did however get a clone of it and I

385
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,409
thought when I first started breeding I

386
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,879
thought it - pika Kansas of all damn

387
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:41,399
places I almost skipped right over that

388
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,620
is the that's probably the coolest town

389
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:47,850
in Kansas I'm gonna vote for Lawrence

390
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:50,009
Lord things in Lawrence Kansas that I

391
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,769
can't even talk about on my boss just he

392
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:55,649
boned and that there's an army base

393
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,720
outside of there yeah he got t-bone

394
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:00,870
there so we ended up spinning like a day

395
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,029
and a half in Lawrence Kansas and it's

396
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,580
not the Kansas I'm used to that's the

397
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:08,279
treasure there's a club every 30 seconds

398
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,139
yes look at the bar you know it's the

399
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,139
liberal stronghold of this it definitely

400
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,000
is kayuu Topeka is pretty close to all

401
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,860
right yeah we went to Topeka we went to

402
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,240
Wichita we went all over the place I

403
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,070
lived in Lawrence for a little while so

404
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,620
I had a good time there but the golden

405
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,650
goat I got a hold of a clone of it um my

406
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,330
good friend Josh a long time ago gave me

407
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,549
a clone of that of the Hawaiian guy I

408
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,930
called the Hawaiian guy I call them

409
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:32,279
pineapple Express is what I used to call

410
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:34,469
him I don't know what that dude in the

411
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,730
long last time so pineapple express

412
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,680
brought me a clone of the golden goat

413
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,800
and when I first started breeding one of

414
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,599
my ideas was I felt bad that in Colorado

415
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:47,639
we had all of the elite genetics and

416
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,440
everybody in like Idaho I know but I'm a

417
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,000
compassionate guy they were like how do

418
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,350
I get these clones I want clones I was

419
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,240
like I can't get you clones of these

420
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,550
elite cuts but I will make seeds of them

421
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,529
so my idea was to make seeds of the

422
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,419
golden goat just by reversing it so I

423
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,669
did put seeds of the golden goat out I'm

424
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:04,919
the one that made the s1 feminized

425
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:06,689
golden goat seeds as far as I know I'm

426
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,519
the only one that has done that I put

427
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,260
about five thousand of those seeds that

428
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,620
are the only people that are bred with

429
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:15,838
it you and I think Scott's done

430
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:19,970
something with it I've seen gage make

431
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:25,770
one strain with golden yeah and then uh

432
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:28,110
Ali quotes this seed company named Ali G

433
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:30,490
no [ __ ]

434
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,220
there's a dude out of San Francisco

435
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,430
yeah Ali G her algae that's what it is

436
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,820
okay I'm gonna have to phonetically but

437
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:41,559
he's uh he's bred a couple strains was

438
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,960
going go cool it's a great it's a great

439
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,969
plan but it was like we're talking about

440
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,990
it was from a bag seed it was an

441
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:52,990
accident that's uh Colorado takes pretty

442
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,940
much all the credit for that but yeah

443
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,340
that is definitely a local string that's

444
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,400
partly my fault and it's a pain in the

445
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,930
ass to keep it yeah that's it's a pain

446
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,789
in the ass to keep a mother you have to

447
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:05,949
take clones from that golden goat often

448
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:09,459
got one hold on to it I guarantee in a

449
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:11,259
few more years that'll be it's a lot of

450
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,330
strains are getting harder to find it's

451
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:15,789
really good original you know the

452
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,070
old-school blueberry show yeah show me a

453
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:24,429
good Kim for give me a p90 one clone

454
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:25,540
yeah Romulan I think it might have been

455
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:27,669

487
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,069
got the phone turned off because working

488
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,910
there's no service back there anyway

489
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:42,009
yeah yeah honey and girl rooms yeah dude

490
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,690
our facility is like a [ __ ] bomb

491
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:45,400
shelter I can look back there for six

492
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,429
months try to turn a radio on in the

493
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,290
middle of although you got kavita's I

494
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:52,090
don't know if s told you no we're way

495
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,619
off topic here but in Denver you guys

496
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,329
this is something that I recently heard

497
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:57,639
and or read about and had a conversation

498
00:17:55,329 --> 00:18:00,129
with multiple people about in Denver

499
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,929
that are driving around okay if you're

500
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,610
running old school magnetic ballasts I'm

501
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:06,070
not sure if the new digital's will do it

502
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:07,899
but the old school magnetics if you're

503
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:10,839
running enough of those they put off an

504
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,820
AM frequency and if you take an AM radio

505
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,319
in that room you have it tuned into the

506
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:16,029
station it's working you can hear it if

507
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,069
you walk near those ballasts it will cut

508
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:21,309
out and make a weird humming noise it's

509
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:24,579
at a specific frequency frequency - yeah

510
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:28,928
and it's uh I've tried it on a couple of

511
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:31,960
places I know of it makes a hum and some

512
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:34,780
something like dashes and beeps it

513
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,720
definitely puts off a unique signal okay

514
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:39,970
yeah the Denver Police are using an

515
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,890
ultra sensitive radio pickup I'm not

516
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,720
probably a strong antenna is what I

517
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,820
guess they're using so they're driving

518
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,069
around who neighborhoods and when they

519
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:50,259
get that they're driving back by with

520
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:53,619
infrared cameras and now they're

521
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:55,569
checking your lights yeah and so there's

522
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:57,549
them all over well once they've done

523
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:58,750
that they're going back home or back to

524
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,879
the station and checking to see if

525
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,500
you're a medical marijuana caregiver so

526
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,330
that you've got permission to have all

527
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,829
these lights or since in the state of

528
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:07,659
Colorado we're only supposed to have six

529
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:09,339
plants if you've got all that light

530
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,870
you're supposed to be registered as a

531
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:12,928
grower if you're not they go and knock

532
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:18,669
on your door and ask what's going on

533
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:20,170
yeah so in Denver be careful for the

534
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,140
cops or for the guys using magnetic

535
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:25,600
ballasts well yeah come by some nanos

536
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:30,790
from me or or Denver store there you go

537
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:32,949
on Beach Street yes ask for Brandon or

538
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:35,319
Cassandra Cassandra that's the chick

539
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,370
you'll see she's cool as [ __ ] is that

540
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,569
the Denver store yeah

541
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:39,069
tarah store I've never been to the

542
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:40,389
Denver store so I may have to drop in

543
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:41,589
there just go wander around and not even

544
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,540
tell them who I am and just walk around

545
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,918
and look at the store I like to do that

546
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:46,359
when they don't know who I am all right

547
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,650
so we're getting we're getting high and

548
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:50,349
getting off-topic here but we've had a

549
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,820
few dabs so that's okay what else was I

550
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:52,240
gonna say I'm gonna be controversial

551
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:54,579
here

552
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,609
I cannot prove this but it is my theory

553
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:59,740
that the Girl Scout cookies is probably

554
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:01,089
a [ __ ] and it was an accident and it's

555
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,359
a bag seed I don't think they bred that

556
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:06,099
on purpose I bread with it you know

557
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:07,869
there's a reason I haven't released any

558
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:10,209
of my stuff yet unless I have very high

559
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:14,500
standards and I haven't been able to

560
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:17,079
achieve them yet but Girl Scout cookies

561
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,539
in my opinion as a harm it does not

562
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:22,359
breach stable I've crossed it it is

563
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:24,308
really neat breeder it is a really neat

564
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:29,019
plant to breed with [ __ ] yeah but it

565
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:30,849
produces hermaphrodites I put it to the

566
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,079
Grateful dog and you would not believe

567
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:33,279
what it put out I'll show you a little

568
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,230
bit after we record here I've got eyes

569
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,000
I've seen some pictures I know a couple

570
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,640
other people that have grown that yeah

571
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,079
yeah no no one's it's that's oh hey

572
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,809
Steve maybe not grateful dog I'm

573
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:48,058
thinking of the other one of the King

574
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:51,069
Kim to the girls yes that's that I was

575
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:53,230
you know after breeding with it and

576
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:55,269
growing and seeing a couple different

577
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,210
hybrids of it you know you can recognize

578
00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:00,039
it real quick for sure but yeah all

579
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,870
right so while we're talking about herm

580
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,700
seeds are not herm seeds about bagged

581
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,719
seeds if you're gonna go back seeds

582
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,819
already said that right you gotta be

583
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,279
careful for hermaphrodites when you're

584
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:12,009
growing these bagged seeds treat it just

585
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,149
like a normal seed during veg you're not

586
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,929
gonna know what the parents are so

587
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,519
you're gonna have to pay a lot of

588
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:18,009
attention to it during flower when you

589
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,160
start flowering you have to look every

590
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:23,140
single day for hermaphrodite flowers on

591
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,440
these plants oh yeah every day and

592
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,420
sometimes twice a day and look out for

593
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,070
males too for the first three weeks look

594
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,509
out for males I've had plants surprise

595
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:33,789
me I thought they were full-on female

596
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:35,259
until about day 20 and they popped open

597
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:38,440
to nutsack somewhere and I'm like oh

598
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:40,869
that's got to go so look for male

599
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,450
flowers herm flowers all over the entire

600
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:45,399
plant once or twice a day through the

601
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,160
entire bloom cycle you guys of a bag

602
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,679
seed because it could her mouth there it

603
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,230
had a seed for a reason and it could her

604
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,850
mouth in the end of week eight so if it

605
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,980
does you either need to be able to

606
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:58,509
harvest it before it produces a seed or

607
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,429
you need to get in there and be able to

608
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:02,470
tweeze out if it makes one or two male

609
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,120
flowers sometimes you can pull them out

610
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,100
with tweezers hit the plant

611
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:07,569
spray the plant with a water bottle just

612
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:09,879
missed it a little bit because this

613
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:11,589
deactivates pollen moisture will ruin

614
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,700
pollen so give it a nice mist get in

615
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:14,168
there with some tweezers and pull out

616
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,298
those male flowers put them in a trash

617
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:18,309
bag throw them away I got in an argument

618
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:22,269
with someone in facebook land the other

619
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:26,139
day I posted a picture of a French hemp

620
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:28,599
plant male and he told me that that

621
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,940
gross spot was ruined for life and that

622
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:35,918
pollen doesn't die and it travels for

623
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:38,308
hundreds of miles and and all that yeah

624
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,140
yeah I think to say about that Jeff I

625
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:42,428
just want to go to that forum or that

626
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,590
post and just troll that guy's what I

627
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:46,120
want to do no actually pollen you can

628
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:48,668
get rid of pollen quite easily sweep the

629
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,349
floor get in there with some water water

630
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:52,720
deactivates pollen ego's it's all you

631
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:54,730
gotta do very fragile yes it's hard to

632
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,980
store in fact it's so hard to store you

633
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,679
have to keep it I keep my pollen I have

634
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,870
little vials of pollen that are sealed

635
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,820
and they are in side of another jar that

636
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:05,558
is sealed and that is inside of a

637
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:07,658
refrigerator that stays dark

638
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:09,609
that's how careful I am with my pollen

639
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:11,409
big shout-out to kin aventure what up

640
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:13,329
rusty rusty threw a bunch of pollen on

641
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:14,770
me the last time he was here he dropped

642
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:16,869
off like four or five little bags of

643
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,490
pollen so there may be some kind of

644
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:20,439
inter Irie crosses coming up in the near

645
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:24,130
future that's where all my Yeti stuff

646
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,820
came from was a friendly pollen delivery

647
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:30,130

hotmail.com i'd love to have you on the

676
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,589
show

677
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,669
alright so we're talking about bagged

678
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,599
seeds what else do you have to add about

679
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,279
bag seed bro

680
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,369
or were we we're a Girl Scout cookies I

681
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,710
was assuming alleging that Girl Scout

682
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:36,329
cookies was probably an accident and

683
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,400
came from bagsied a part of my theory on

684
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:41,039
that is because I've heard so many

685
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,500
different rumors and legends of how it

686
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,170
was made and who made it and I've never

687
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,759
the people that are alleged to have made

688
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,090
it have never said what it is and they

689
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,279
won't

690
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:51,720
I hear it's an f-1 that's what I hear a

691
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,700
lot I'll call him out they've said

692
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,950
straight up they've said two or three

693
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,630
different stories so I wouldn't even

694
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,340
believe anything they said at this point

695
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,020
I've read at least three different

696
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:02,909
stories and high times and they all say

697
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,559
they came from the same people like and

698
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,940
they all say no one has it and that's a

699
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,349
bunch of [ __ ] it's everywhere if you

700

you if you really want something go to

714
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,100
the forums that's the truth I've got two

715
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,660
sources for club two or three good

716
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:41,219
sources for clones around here and one

717
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,779
of them he gets everything from the

718
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,220
forum's he's kind of a quiet guy he does

719
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:46,200
not look like a pot grower he looks like

720
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,630
you probably would work on computers or

721
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,860
study law somewhere and so he shows up

722
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,510
with a briefcase and opens it up and

723
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:53,849
drops me off a few cuttings this Emmylou

724
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,950
[ __ ] that he got online I love when

725
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:57,449
clones come from him and also it seems

726
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,190
like right around the same time he gets

727
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,049
them either you or Spence will end up

728
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,519

729
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:03,990

730
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,269

731
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,549
I'll run them side-by-side and I'm

732
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:11,160

733
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:12,569

734
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,890

735
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:15,299

spend on some high quality seeds that we

752
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:53,359
know all the history behind them and

753
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,120
they were bred by magic elves in a

754
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:58,459
dungeon in Quebec I'm just being a

755

whatever you paid for it

778
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,519

779
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:42,139
there and then you could have the next

780

yeah yeah every single strain we were

788
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,460
smoking came from seed every one of them

789
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:09,109
yeah I can't think of one strain that

790
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:14,120
didn't come from seed and if you can

791
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:15,679
I'll give you $100 because every [ __ ]

792
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:18,199
cannabis plant we were smoking came from

793
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,549
a seed somewhere uh if you grow out that

794
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,150
bag seed you could have a couple under

795
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:24,379
right there because a lot of times you

796
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,150

797

809
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,949
true story

810
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,230
alright I've been rambling a lot I need

811
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,850
a DAB and then I think we're thinking

812
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,960
might be we would go for close to thirty

813
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:58,418
minutes here we could probably start

814
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,558
wrapping up this part dude

815
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:02,480
alright guys we tried to wrap up this

816
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,460
episode but the conversation kept going

817
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,980
so what I decided to do was to make this

818
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,919
a two-part episode so I will drop

819
