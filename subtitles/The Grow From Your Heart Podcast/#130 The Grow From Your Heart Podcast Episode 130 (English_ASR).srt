so Mike hung out with the kid on 4/20 I

108
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,949
was gonna ask kabuki what he did but he

109
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:13,840
has taken a glob over here of some rosin

110
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:15,488
so we're gonna have to give him a minute

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:28,509
I was like the week's worth of my cabs

112
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:29,978

113
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:34,560
turns different colors has to run to the

114
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:37,120
bathroom and hide for a minute Thank You

115
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,819
Franky what do you do on 4/20 bro my

116
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,600
first was pretty low-key Sh

117
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:46,689
you know my girl's mom was in town so we

118
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,270
just kinda kicked it and then mama a

119
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:50,439
smoker yeah she's totally pro candidates

120
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:55,329
goin super scary yeah she's super

121
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:57,009
awesome awesome yeah definitely so

122
00:04:55,329 --> 00:05:00,219
that's mom's support cannabis even if

123
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:03,219
they don't do yeah and then I sponsored

124
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,800
the 5280 glass showcase which was really

125
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,700
cool from what I heard it went on pretty

126
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,379
long from like 4:00 to midnight and I

127
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,978
caught it towards the end of it I showed

128
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:18,129
up at 8:00 where was that happening at

129
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:20,079
Native Hotel in downtown Dani TIV yes

130
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:22,810
and it was cool how they handle that

131
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,579
because they had two buses outside where

132
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,519
any dabbing or smoking or any

133
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:29,529
consumption was done so though obviously

134
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,659
we can do anything you know in the hotel

135
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,250
right they had made space and I counted

136
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,840
four people that were getting medicated

137
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,339
and they weren't [ __ ] with it all

138
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,899
night which doesn't only give a shot as

139
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:40,839
to Adam Dunn and his crew they were the

140
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:43,329
first people I ever saw who's rented

141
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,679
buses to party they had tour buses for

142
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:46,180
bands and we parked them outside of the

143
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,709
Fox or the oriental theater one night

144
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,168
and they're like you can't medicate in

145
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:52,359
here but this is a VIP bus wink wink and

146
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:55,389
we're a little it's private property

147
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,038
exactly that's how that worked out and

148
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,259
yeah it was a cool event submerging a

149
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,120
local glass artist a lot of people

150
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,310
showed up a lot of friendly faces

151
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,610
it was super fun after that I went to

152
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,500
see some good friends of mine downtown

153
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,050
one ate some pizza some mac and cheese

154
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,750
pizza from [ __ ] I can remember the name

155
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,520
of this cheese pizza oh it was awesome

156
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,990
that sounds familiar if I can like you

157
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,779
know because it's white cheese sauce

158
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,319
from the Mac and in New York style bread

159
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:26,218
on the is awesome why did you do that

160
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,218
show

161
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,879
[Music]

162

of fun I think a lot of good [ __ ] comes

178
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,579
out on these random conversations you've

179
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,030
been all over the place where do you

180
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:14,859
find smokes the most herb are we talking

181
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:19,959
Colorado only are we talking in anywhere

182
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,278
yeah okay so I'll say this California is

183
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,408
interesting because you know I was in

184
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:25,089
the Bay and northern Cali and you know

185
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:27,610
it's very cannabis friendly up there as

186
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:30,629
far as the cities go lifestyle culture

187
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,550
it's very cannabis integrated you know

188
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:35,228
but as of lately

189
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:39,579
Colorado within the last year I feel has

190
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:45,908
really stepped their [ __ ] up you know so

191
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:48,459
yeah and I want to say there's so many

192
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:50,908
[ __ ] people that blow it down heavy

193
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:53,560
down here yeah between Denver and Pueblo

194
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:55,689
there's a lot of heavy heads and I know

195
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,180
let me reiterate that from the mountains

196
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:00,038
up north to Pueblo there's a lot of

197
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,530
really heavy head so I still think that

198
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,229
people in Colorado really throw it down

199
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:07,329
and it just it's time for the city in

200
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,040
our culture to catch up with it you know

201
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,620
right yeah so shout out to Colorado

202
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,439

203

208
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:27,550

209
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,680
to admit it or not yeah it's just about

210
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,509

211
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,310
about wearing a badge or anything but

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,570
adamant about gun stuff and stuff and

264
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,850
you can see it in his glass work because

266

268
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,450
own regard there's yeah lunch box

269
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,250
mechanic

270
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,910
Matt painter he was there doing his

271
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:06,250
thing yeah there's a lot of [ __ ] there I

272
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:07,449
got there pretty late and it was mostly

273
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,220
about just seeing people you know

274
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,339
because I hadn't gone into Denver almost

275
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,960
you know two three months on any event

276
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,089
like that so it was nice just catching

277
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,430
up with all friendly faces from came

278
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,440
into Denver that's the fun of course

279
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:22,449
absolutely and the other art was just

280
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,060
you know a bonus it was weird not having

281
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,100
a cannabis cup usually where I see

282
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,019
everybody I want to say as much [ __ ] as

283
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,370
people talk about the cup or whatever

284
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:32,169
they you know whatever gripes they have

285
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,299
against you know the competition side of

286
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:38,169
it or whatever it is you can definitely

287
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:40,208
feel the mist presence of that event

288
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:41,439
absolutely it may people had their

289
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,208
opinions about it and whatever you

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,339
thought of it it was just a great place

291
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:47,349
to meet up with everybody I would see

292
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,930
everybody from Addison to Maura to

293
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,490
kabuki J Fox to just my random local

294
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:54,059
friends there and we would all get along

295
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,990
and hang out up dab with Danny Danko uh

296
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:57,609
everybody we just hang out it would be

297
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,110
such a good time and there's nowhere

298
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,528
else you can go and see that many people

299
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,209
no not not at the same place and though

300
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:06,009
it's cool because now we you know I

301
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,719
unfortunately missed secret sesh this

302
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,860
year so I'm glad that I've been told

303
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,209
that they're gonna be planning it for

304
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,810
the next one because we'll be out there

305
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:16,479
hard but a lot of you know a lot of

306
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:18,649
events were planned and I feel like of

307
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,230
the

308
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:24,019
seven the five to seven events that I

309
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:27,558
heard of three to four of them all but

310
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:30,169
two and the showcase it got rated yes

311
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:34,488
did shut down almost all consumption

312
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:36,048
events yeah that was because I tried to

313
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:37,850
pick up a water bottle off of an oil

314
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:39,708
slick pad and there was so much oil on

315
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,659
the oil slick pad that the water bottle

316
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,748
just stuck to it and it was pretty damn

317
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:46,159
funny if you heard my goofy laughter

318
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:48,199
that was all about their geometric tree

319
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,328
yeah well I accidentally am a magician

320
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:54,258

585
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,080
that might be interesting actually they

586
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,700
claim to have found some drugs actually

587
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:20,349
oh really in the DJ booth they claimed

588
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,350
there were some drugs in the DJ booth no

589
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:26,139
[ __ ] but also the DJ booth was the only

590
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:27,699
room without a camera so who knows yeah

591
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,590
you know it's hard to it's hard to say

592
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,880
what happened there definitely but so

593
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:32,709
there was an event at a place called

594
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,030
Riggs R Us and it was the Colorado Cup

595
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,289
and it was an event similar to a

596
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:37,389
cannabis cup where people enter their

597
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:39,460
strains of cannabis extracts edibles and

598
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:42,070
cannabis wares and whatnots and people

599
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,039
judge them and they decided a winner on

600
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:47,500
4/20 at 3:00 p.m. the Denver City police

601
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,480
came in with bandanas on their faces and

602
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,980
shotguns in their hands kicked in the

603
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,140
front doors and started yelling get out

604
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,099
get out get out and half of the people

605
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,360
that were in there thought the place was

606
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,740
getting robbed because they did not

607
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:58,119
announce that they were police until

608
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,190
everybody left and everybody was on the

609
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,529
ground then a uniformed officer walked

610
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,539
in and delivered a search warrant huh

611
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:05,529
yeah after everything was all yeah so

612
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:07,059
everybody thought the place was getting

613
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:09,059
[ __ ] robbed I had a friend who was

614
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:10,769
there she sent me a bunch of stuff

615
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,950
yeah she sent me a video from the place

616
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:16,680
the cops that first one in just looked

617
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,210
like thugs in Dickies and combat boots

618
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,860
and bandanas and they were followed by

619
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,620
armed cops who were then followed by

620
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:26,159
like riot cops just to come shut down

621
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:28,709
any illegal smudge of peaceful [ __ ]

622
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,960
stoners yeah exactly they needed riot

623
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,630
gear how much of our tax money was that

624
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,130
a lot and actually sounds like 60 grand

625
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:38,130
from what you just said there were

626
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,870
several MacBooks being used for data

627
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,550
entry for the cup that was happening

628
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:43,049
yeah and these cops poured bottled water

629
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,579
all over the back books are you [ __ ]

630
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:46,950

631
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:53,519
MacBooks yeah yeah for no reason

632
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:54,000
destruction allegedly I was not there on

633
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,269
the street

634
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,380
yeah and Denver PD it doesn't have the

635
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:02,910
cleanest record for how they deal with

636
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,740
public affairs do we want to read any of

637
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,930
it I could read you absolutely because

638
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,370
38 charges filed against these folks I

639
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,980

646
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:29,789
Gypsy Jane Fest I remember seeing the

647
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:32,279
post it was a huge joke he maybe they

648
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:34,289
got stooped to come in to do whatever he

649
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:38,250
did for a few minutes half the artists

650
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:40,889
didn't show up the company running it

651
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,140
lied about ticket sales a lot of vendors

652
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,960
got [ __ ] some people bought $40,000

653
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,509
booths and recouped nothing on top of

654
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,220
that it was like a three-day event and

655
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:52,349
on the second day a lot of these

656
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,140
people's stuff got broken into and the

657
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:56,909
guys that came in to promote the event

658
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,410
and help build it at all left and left

659
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,920
everything high and dry

660
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:05,750
so AJ's role in this was they had seeked

661
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,750
him out to do the

662
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:13,540
judging portion of the edible

663
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,339
competition and concentrate competition

664
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:18,970
and what ended up happening was he took

665
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:22,029
like 17 grams or 14 I camera it was over

666
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,490
half an ounce of concentrated from us

667
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:26,529
and told us that no dispensaries would

668
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,240
be entering and that it would just be in

669
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:29,740
an independent thing and I said sure why

670
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,960
not me my roommate at the time got some

671
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:36,880
flour we ran it whatever the case was

672
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,440
and you know it was okay but [ __ ] I

673
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,060
can't remember the name of them the

674
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,789
clinic or someone who had just gone

675
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:46,210
wreck came in and bought [ __ ] a

676
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:48,490
solution turned in category entry for

677
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:52,420
every category and just kind of avoided

678
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:54,339
everything he said so on top of that we

679
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,410
found out that my and she was never

680
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:58,779
judged and this is a year ago so let's

681
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:02,019
flash forward to Colorado cup Steve

682
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:03,879
Dafina and his flower entry he had two

683
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,410
entries his cheese quick which I can

684
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,120
personally say as an extractor as a

685
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,610
grower as a breeder you know he does

686
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,579
great [ __ ] work I love you extracted

687
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:14,729
at Luvdisc wishes super chirpy material

688
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:18,279
I love it

689
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:20,259
he also entered your heart of cold heart

690
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:24,069
of gold which is a golden go cross

691
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:28,140
called a grateful dog yes very sativa

692
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:31,659
dominant cross you would so yeah okay so

693
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:34,990
in the whole scheme of things you know

694
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,660
what he just said it got raided steve

695
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,339
olmos losses you know possessions or

696
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,259
whatever the case was because that whole

697
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:42,730
thing he ended up getting it and they're

698
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:44,650
giving him [ __ ] or whatever the case was

699
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,539
but he didn't find out till a few days

700
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,330
later after they announced that the

701
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:51,519
winnings that his entries weren't even

702
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:53,529
judged which you know is typical is

703
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,440
something that AJ would do now let's

704
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:58,089
rewind a little bit again he would do

705
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,279
these things and promote these events

706
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:01,899
called canter raves and whatever the

707
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:03,730
case was I wasn't really around for them

708
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,259
I have just only heard and it's the same

709
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,940
sim another thing he wouldn't get

710
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:08,920
permits for anything the cops would

711
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,420
constantly come to the events the

712
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,240
vendors would get [ __ ] because he

713
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,700
would collect money he was charging more

714
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,089
money for what he was like Oh

715
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,220
if you want your entry tested $40 what

716
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:24,459
that actually costs is 25 so he was

717
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:27,220
actually skimming off the top of every

718
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,440
entry yeah you know that was made on top

719
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,829
of what he was getting so it's kind of

720
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,019
like you know I can understand why

721
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:37,869
someone would be upset Steve our good

722
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:40,269
friend Steve was not too happy when he

723
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:45,909
heard that you know and it was verified

724
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:47,349
and I just feel like one people with

725
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,970
that kind of traffic you should just not

726
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:51,069
do events I have nothing good to say

727
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,470
about a J dude I can smoke with you

728
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:55,059
whatever but I can't say the same for

729
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,339
Steve or some of the other competitors

730
00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:00,599
is she kind of [ __ ] over so that being

731
00:27:57,339 --> 00:28:03,369
said being Steve been talking about

732
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:05,139
authenticity and competition and trying

733
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:07,779
to do something more towards that but

734
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:13,660
that was a huge bust on their part of

735
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:15,700
the competition and you know yeah I wish

736
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,710
it hadn't gone that way when people told

737
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,630
me about the Colorado Cup I asked who

738
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,059
was throwing in when I heard who it was

739
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,810
I kind of had to pull from it knowing

740
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:24,279
that one

741
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,799
the cops were they able to get involved

742
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:28,480
her to my entry he's going to be taken

743
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,039
and you know I could just go to patients

744
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,650
if that's the case you know like why

745
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,450
bother so so that reminds me that I did

746
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,120
not do a shout out to the venue where we

747
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:39,009
held the secrets I don't know that I

748
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,529
want to say the name of the venue I'm

749
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:43,450

750
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:46,420

754
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,200

the co-host because in June and July I

756

758

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,558
just oral that's probably so that's

783
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,840

DJ room scale in the DJ room so this

790
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:39,850
piece of paper here leads me to believe

791
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:42,159
that the DJ is [ __ ] just the legal

792
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:44,079
disclaimer Rasta Jeff Nagar from our

813
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,189
where were we we were kind of in the

814
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:25,259
middle of slandering AJ hashman

815
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,759
yeah well not really I was expressing my

816
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,379
views which had nothing to do with you

817
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,180
by the way thank you for letting me

818
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,910
express them but I am addressing them on

819
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,549
the behalf of my friend Steve who really

820
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:37,230
feels like he got shafted and it's just

821
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,970
unfortunate you know because I tried to

822
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,410
warn him and him being a good person

823
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:45,329
tried to give him the benefit of the

824
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:47,759
doubt and hey it's like it's like

825
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:50,519
chlamydia you learn a lesson once with

826
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,559
that [ __ ] and AJ is just kind of like

827
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,480
dealing with him in a business sense is

828
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,399
never wonderful you're not looking to go

860
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:59,339
stuff okay um I've got a thing on my

861
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,839
phone let me find I just took a

862
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:01,949
screenshot of a message of somebody Sam

863
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,589
you know everything is in our damn

864
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:09,750
phones these days yeah now it's crazy

865
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:11,129
stupid this guy says I'm gonna summarize

866
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,259
a little bit he says his mother-in-law

867
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:15,240
has Parkinson's and is really against

868
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:16,890
pharmaceuticals he's to the point where

869
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,960
she's really getting bad after listening

870
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,460
to countless hours of my show this

871
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,850
listen her figure that I may have an

872
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:27,360
idea as far as strains and whatnot she's

873
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:29,250
onto the idea of medical marijuana but

874
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,219
has it in her mind that the CBD

875
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,859
available in Texas will not help and

876
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,390
this person is sure that they won't if

877
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:36,898
we could please lay some knowledge on

878
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,778
this list

879
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:41,189
about this there's a whole family that

880
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:43,069
would appreciate it

881
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,389
first of all I'm gonna be a grammar nazi

882
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:50,249
let's let's correct the world here with

883
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:52,378
CBDs let's just start saying CBD cds is

884
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:54,960
not pluralized the same way that we

885
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:58,079
don't paralyze th seas right you know

886
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,649
it's just we don't do it and we or water

887
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,878
yeah water yeah do don't say waters I

888
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:03,418
don't get all the waters out of this

889
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:06,418
glass

890
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:08,639
it's yeah it's CBD there's yeah this is

891
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,500
for everybody yeah and also since I'm on

892
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,899
this it's not strands it is strains

893
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,099
strands or hair strains or canvas if you

894
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:16,769
want to get specific you could say

895
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:18,599
cultivar or varietal but let's just not

896
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:26,429
say [ __ ] strands I haven't heard the

897
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:30,750
strands you just said strands I'm

898
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:34,528
leaving this guy and also since we are

899
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:36,418
we're making jokes about this but I I'm

900
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:38,668
sorry your mother-in-law has Parkinson's

901
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,408
that is terrible to hear about and Fox

902
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:42,989
is the guy here that is great at helping

903
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:44,519
with this type of stuff so first he

904
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:46,439
wants to know if we can recommend a

905
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:50,969
stream that would help with Parkinson's

906
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,338
okay so there's a few options if she is

907
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:54,898
okay with the cannabis and there's a few

908
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:56,659
one-to-one options that we can go with

909
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:59,960
that would be wonderful

910
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:03,989
you know Tora Bora being one of them

911
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,480
Taurus ooh Harlequin which I think comes

912
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:08,429
in at a three to one or two the one and

913
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,690
certain certain cases seven to one

914
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:14,548
another great strain if she's coming

915
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:17,608
around or slowly coming around to the

916
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:19,679
idea of medical cannabis I would say

917
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:23,190
started off with the higher CBD strains

918
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:25,558
to you know higher ratio CBD THC auto

919
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,929
from Centennial seed oh that that's a

920
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,640
great example so obviously the year in

921
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:33,480
Texas so your options are very limited

922
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:35,788
and unless you can get a specific cut of

923
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,159
this you know of what I'm talking about

924
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:40,140
on the ACDC set at least you're gonna

925
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,460
have to go with something like the auto

926
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,710
but from what I understand it's like one

927
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,000
hundred and twenty to one so and it's

928
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,139
you know when he keeps saying I'm gonna

929
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,760
interrupt you I'm sorry he keeps saying

930
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:50,779
a hundred and twenty to one or two to

931
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,090
one we're talking about THC to CBD ratio

932
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,190
and we're trying to find the higher CBD

933
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:57,470
ratio for you as what we need yes so

934
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,210
that she's not gonna get the killer head

935
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:00,679
but she's not gonna be high and giggly

936
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,710
she's actually gonna get the medicinal

937
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:05,539
benefits from the cannabis because it's

938
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,860
higher in CBD than THC

939
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,690
there's more to clear that up you keep I

940
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,400
don't know how many people understand

941
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:13,670
the ratio and no absolutely no thank you

942
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,440
for for for I try not to go past people

943
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,510
to know you're fine that's great because

944
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,059
I forget to elaborate on that sometimes

945
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:22,250
I'm not the best at that so um yeah that

946
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:24,139
being said and like you said Centennial

947
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:28,760
seeds oughta would be great

948
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:30,379
I think CBD crew is another string you

949
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,670
know seed company that would be able to

950
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:36,740
help booms farm also has some strains

951
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,840
that are you know like I said you you

952
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:40,729
know you can tell them what your

953
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,730
situation is where you are and they'll

954
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:45,349
be able to help you with their strain

955
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,750
list and give you something that you

956
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:49,759
know will but keep you you know in the

957
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,099
legal boundaries of what you need but to

958
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,540
just let's say with the ATO the others

959
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:56,719
are great to start off with and let's

960
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:59,630
just say one so CBD is in Europe

961
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:03,939
attractant there's been a few cases done

962
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:07,490
on the effects of CBD on Parkinson's and

963
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:11,150
it absolutely helps with the confusion

964
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:15,439
it helps with the tremors it helps with

965
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:17,630
a lot of the symptoms as you see usually

966
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,019
with that disease or anything you know

967
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:24,619
and related to that condition so yes

968
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:29,059

that you can get I'm sorry that the

974
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:46,010
company's eluding me at this point you

you need something quicker than just

979
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:55,909
growing what will help her part of his

980
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:58,580
question was that he does not believe

981
00:37:55,909 --> 00:38:00,920
that the CBD products available in Texas

982
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:02,119
will be of much use and I asked him more

983
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,490
questions about this we had a little

984
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:07,009
short conversation on message on the

985
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:08,599
my messenger here I asked him he said he

986
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,600
doesn't feel like the CBD available

987
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,889
there in Texas will help and he's sure

988
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,239
that they won't and then he asked me how

989
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:15,710
I felt about that and I asked why he

990
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,299
doesn't feel like the CBD there will

991
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,309
he'll have it the same question he said

992
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,820
that he doesn't believe it's going to be

993

CBD oil which we've seen a lot people

994

1026
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:44,358
talking about oh yeah absolutely

1027
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:46,009
okay you know I was working with Halo

1028
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:48,319
labs for a while which and they were

1029
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,940
doing an isolate that was we were

1030
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,660
getting back at ninety nine point five

1031
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:56,780
versus five seven percent and I infused

1032
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:58,429
a lot of DC illegal products with a lot

1033
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,800
of those hard candies and lollipops that

1034
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:03,108
I made with 50 state legal and you know

1035
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,940
I sent those a for free to a lot of

1036
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:07,009
people because they were skeptical about

1037
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,409
that and you know just to get an idea

1038
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:11,750
some people obviously we support whole

1039
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:14,389
plant cannabis I mean you know both is

1040
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,530
best the whole plant is best but if

1041
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:16,639
you're in a situation to have a

1042
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,280
condition where

1043
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,679
it's more neurologically tied than

1044
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,269
higher concentrations of CBD is where

1045
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,129
you want to be and so you know

1046
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:26,570

1048
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:37,190

Brothers unfortunately yeah is that

1085
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,640
product worth of [ __ ] in your opinion

1086
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,230
absolutely not

1087
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,150
you know actually I'll tell you what I'm

1088
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,440

gonna have it tested through my friend

1090
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,450
Nate and then we should do another

1091
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,800
podcast I'm all about that even over you

1092
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:27,429
cost of that bottle to do it on the

1093
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,960
podcast oh yeah for sure

1094
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:32,949
absolutely I'm sure they would you know

1095
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,798
love to do it for me of course yeah

1096
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:38,199
definitely but yeah I I think that

1097
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:40,449
they're the biggest charlatans of all so

1098
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:42,159
you definitely have to be careful just

1099
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:45,038
you know a little bit of research goes a

1100
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,259
long way you can also look into halo

1101
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:50,109
labs out of Arizona

1102
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,520
they are big wholesalers that well and

1103
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:54,308
they you know work with other companies

1104
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,028
to completely revamp products under what

1105
00:42:54,309 --> 00:43:00,160
they do that they're allowed in Arizona

1106
00:42:57,028 --> 00:43:02,048
so yeah and like I said I'm a completely

1107
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,210

00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:52,358
to close

1130
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:53,769
great folks um something I should

1131
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:56,650
mention if you're going to consume

1132
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:58,929
cannabis for your Parkinson's ah don't

1133
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,389
only focus on the CBD for the healing I

1134
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:03,219
would recommend something a light sativa

1135
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:06,699
like a jelly bean yeah or @anjghie

1136
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:08,469
because you need I think the sativa the

1137
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:10,629
THC and the sativa is good to help

1138
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:12,639
treatment but at the same time that's

1139
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,440
gonna put you the patient in a better

1140
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:15,730
mood it's gonna uh flip up lift your

1141
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,960
spirits a little bit it's gonna make you

1142
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,730
a little more social it's gonna put a

1143
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,409
smile on your face and that's a huge

1144
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:22,028
part of healing people is keeping them

1145
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:24,068
happy and keeping a smile on their face

1146
00:44:22,028 --> 00:44:27,298
absolutely your mood is everything

1147
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:30,630
especially in recovery and healing

1148
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:32,880
so strains that have you know known

1149
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:37,979
properties of uplifting you know mood

1150
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:41,039
and you know anti-anxiety Julie being a

1151
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:42,478
screen for me Dairy Queen okay a lot of

1152
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,399
the Queen's kind of do that they don't I

1153
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:47,068
don't find them as racy I find them as

1154
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:48,688
smooth creamy relaxing all right to

1155
00:44:47,068 --> 00:44:51,028
vortex on the other hand

1156
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:53,398
oh yeah that's a vortex used to [ __ ]

1157
00:44:51,028 --> 00:44:55,199
yeah yeah that's like same breeder

1158
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:56,728
though it's all TGA subculture yeah yeah

1159
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,759
definitely and they have a wide variety

1160
00:44:56,728 --> 00:45:01,198
of things in that line of stuff so I

1161
00:44:59,759 --> 00:45:02,398
think that's awesome that things like

1162
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,469
that are available and you're right you

1163
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:06,838
know not to just focus on the CBD only

1164
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:12,119
side of things below the Colorado flow

1165
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:14,578
is a very hello TJ shores blueberry you

1166
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:16,739
know it's not the most knock you down

1167
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:18,959
strain but the Smokies incredibly

1168
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:20,849
enjoyable very medicinal as well it'll

1169
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:22,588
have it could have good CBD and a very

1170
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:24,119
good hide aroma or a head high to it and

1171
00:45:22,588 --> 00:45:26,219
a nice blueberry aroma yeah absolutely

1172
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,599
yeah shout at the DJ short he's been

1173
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:29,188
breathing for longer than most of us

1174
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,739
have even been thinking about cannabis

1175
00:45:29,188 --> 00:45:33,478
yes or had any inclination of wanting to

1176
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:35,369
work with a true breeder true true

1177
00:45:33,478 --> 00:45:37,108
breeder definitely alright so a second

1178
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:39,929
ago you mentioned t-shirt

1179
00:45:37,108 --> 00:45:43,078
yep um we were talking about tincture

1180
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:46,289
and dosage on another episode what do

1181
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:51,509
you recommend for dosage on a t-shirt

1182
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:53,278
say somebody has cancer or maybe I don't

1183
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:55,528
even want to diagnose anybody with

1184
00:45:53,278 --> 00:45:56,998
another condition but a sick person

1185
00:45:55,528 --> 00:45:59,668
we'll just go with cancer it sounds

1186
00:45:56,998 --> 00:46:01,558
decent cancer because it'll be different

1187
00:45:59,668 --> 00:46:03,449
you know if it's more focused on the

1188
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:06,028
near logical condition and it's a higher

1189
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:07,528
dose of CBD and if it's TC only or

1190
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:09,958
whether they're getting delta nine or

1191
00:46:07,528 --> 00:46:12,179
all factors in how it's going to go but

1192
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:13,848
so cancer we're gonna go the other way

1193
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:18,449
around

1194
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:19,949
obviously treatment that with guidelines

1195
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:21,778
that we followed is through you know

1196
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:24,659
rick simpson though i don't use his

1197
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:27,679
extraction methods of you know gram a

1198
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:27,679
day for 90 days

1199
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:36,269
and in doing that you know when I say

1200
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:38,009
that THC high oil and when I say a gram

1201
00:46:36,268 --> 00:46:40,949
of day it's really more like a thousand

1202
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:45,269
milligrams a day and obviously you know

1203
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:47,759
a gram isn't a thousand milligrams so

1204
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:49,949
that's something that we you know not

1205
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:51,298
enough gets focused on so in the short

1206
00:46:49,949 --> 00:46:52,828
of it let's not say grandpa day let's

1207
00:46:51,298 --> 00:46:56,099
say a thousand milligrams a day for 90

1208
00:46:52,829 --> 00:47:00,839
days that's gonna make people feel like

1209
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:02,519
[ __ ] also yeah there's you know they

1210
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:04,048
usually you know the way you would start

1211
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:05,909
you know and because people been

1212
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:08,159
consuming this oil raw for so long they

1213
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:10,498
would start with like little pea-sized

1214
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:13,429
bits and that would [ __ ] them up and

1215
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:17,268
they've kind of worked their way up

1216
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:19,409
you know trying to work with different

1217
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:22,288
extraction methods and non-solvent

1218
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:24,478
techniques and trying to you know gain

1219
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:28,829
the same uptake you know and in the

1220
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:31,618
amount but not feeling so sluggish or

1221
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:34,680
more importantly some of some of our

1222
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:36,989
bodies can't process that oil either way

1223
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:39,629
that we should rush yeah and it's better

1224
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:41,759
left as a topical for a melanoma so at

1225
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,579
that point if our bodies can't process

1226
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:46,559
it or if you know if we have compromised

1227
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:48,420
digestive problems you know whether it

1228
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,249
be Crohn's colitis whatever the cases

1229
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,798
throw that [ __ ] out the door you need

1230
00:47:50,248 --> 00:47:57,808
something that isn't going arm your gut

1231
00:47:52,798 --> 00:47:59,788
you know that because because of how the

1232
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:03,359
extraction right that leaves it a little

1233
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:04,890
it's a little harsh you know yeah

1234
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,440
there's sludgy there's a little burn to

1235
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:09,598
it regardless of how clean it is a lot

1236
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,548
of people aren't using grape ethanol

1237
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,289
most people are using Everclear because

1238
00:48:11,548 --> 00:48:14,429
that's what's available to them so

1239
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:16,890
there's a lot of those things that come

1240
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:19,169
into account you know so we try not to

1241
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:21,748
deal with that at all

1242
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:23,579
you know you've seen me I'm focusing

1243
00:48:21,748 --> 00:48:26,308
more on the non solvent part of that and

1244
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:28,079
trying to focus and you know D winterize

1245
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:31,259
rosin and start doing things of that

1246
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,140
sort and seeing what we can do without

1247
00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:36,298
having to use alcohol or butane butane

1248
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:37,489
or solvents yeah you know and keep it

1249
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:41,989
organic

1250
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:44,689
a friend of ours is starting a vineyard

1251
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:47,269
you know with some grapes and we're

1252
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:49,700
gonna be doing a little you know little

1253
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:53,269
project we'll be making our own grape

1254
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:55,879
ethanol yeah so you know we're trying to

1255
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:59,389
make this all in you know Pablo

1256
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:01,640
nonetheless so it's all a Colorado

1257
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:03,500
organic at the imitate so the people

1258
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:05,059
that talk crap about Pueblo we're doing

1259
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,159
something so yeah oh yeah I wanna hear

1260
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:08,480
oh yeah I'm super happy to come down and

1261
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:10,250
be part of you know there's already a

1262
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,980
lot of great people could caregivers

1263
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:15,829
good breeders doing their things so yeah

1264
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:18,019
definitely public comment so for cancer

1265
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:19,489
you'd basically recommend 1000

1266
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:22,219
milligrams of THC

1267
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:24,409
per day to try to fight the cancer and

1268
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:26,269
you do that for at least 90 days yeah I

1269
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:29,420
mean you know I know that sounds intense

1270
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:30,829
and so I'll say this you know if it's

1271
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:35,000
for our loved ones or whatever the cases

1272
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:37,789
taking it via suppository will bypass

1273
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,210
that feeling of you eating you know a

1274
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:44,000
gram plus a day our bodies will still

1275
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:46,570
take it and absorb it and we'll get all

1276
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,940
the cancer killing qualities of the THC

1277
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:51,740
without that effect of it going through

1278
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,570
our digestive system and then into our

1279
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:56,118
bloodstream you know you'll probably get

1280
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:58,670
more of it yeah and if you do get it

1281
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,380
absorbed quicker okay without it it's

1282
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,970
pretty amazing how that works you know

1283
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,400
and we're not talking about just putting

1284
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:06,709
some hash or buds in your but you guys

1285
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,420
know it's got to be activated it's

1286
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,789
probably some hash oil with some coconut

1287
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,409
oil inside of a pill yeah a special pill

1288
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:14,690
and then you have to obviously know

1289
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:17,420
where you're placing it so it goes into

1290
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:20,150
your tract and so on and so forth and I

1291
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,858
don't know too specific but you know if

1292
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:24,740
you guys are curious about that again

1293
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:26,750
you know ask me I'm more than happy to

1294
00:50:24,739 --> 00:50:29,659
go into that if you want to do an

1295
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:32,269
episode on gastrointestinal you know

1296
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:35,358
side effects and things with CBD we

1297
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:36,829
could totally do that but this guy lives

1298
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:38,929
like 15 minutes away from me now you

1299
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:40,789
guys so who will be on this a lot send

1300
00:50:38,929 --> 00:50:43,039
me all of your CBD questions yeah

1301
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:45,529
definitely I'm more than happy to you

1302
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,170
know help in any way I can but yeah at

1303
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,000
least a thousand milligrams a day

1304
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:51,740
obviously a lot of people don't have

1305
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,039
that advantage of knowing someone who

1306
00:50:51,739 --> 00:50:56,299
can make to support or ease maybe that's

1307
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:59,000
something I can work on in the future

1308
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:01,160
and try to just you know create you know

1309
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,650
put something out there is a little you

1310
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:07,789
know formula for people to follow but in

1311
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:10,010
the meanwhile if you can find on the

1312
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:11,929
same level there are people who make ten

1313
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,790
thousand milligram cancers where every

1314
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:16,309
dropper is like four hundred milligrams

1315
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:17,989
you know if you happen to be in Colorado

1316
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:23,179
or medical state it's gonna be much

1317
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:25,279
easier to find these if not again you

1318
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:28,969
know trying to find the material and

1319
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,300
create that you know that medicine is

1320
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:35,389
essential you know you're gonna have to

1321
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:36,859
basically get your math right and it's

1322
00:51:35,389 --> 00:51:39,049
just so different it breaks my heart

1323
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:40,730
speaking you know about that to other

1324
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,010
people knowing that they're in states

1325
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,389
where they can't get their oil tested so

1326
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:47,960
they can't get the math right on what

1327
00:51:44,389 --> 00:51:50,059
the dosage really is and so there

1328
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,559
there's a guessing game of if they're

1329
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:53,719
lucky enough to have the material to

1330
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:55,250
make the oil the way they need to how

1331
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:56,750
the [ __ ] are they gonna dose it or how

1332
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,690
the [ __ ] are they gonna accurately like

1333
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:05,539
and it just upsets me you know for them

1334
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:07,070
as patients but nevertheless you know

1335
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:09,019
where there's the will there's a way you

1336
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:12,350
know and lives are more important than

1337
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:15,800
laws in my opinion hash tag lives over

1338
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:17,900
laws yeah so people you know people

1339
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,900
listening that are you know curious

1340
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:24,500
about that you know I don't support

1341
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:28,070
anything that would ever jeopardize your

1342
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,960
freedom but if you're trying to help

1343
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:32,119
someone you love then I will happily

1344
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,070
share whatever information I can you

1345
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:35,990
know Fox is here to teach people sit

1346
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:38,000
down with each and every one of you and

1347
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,509
teach you what he knows if that's what's

1348
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,119
needed

1349
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:43,070
pretty much so we talked about somebody

1350
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,019
with cancer what about if you've just

1351
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,900
got like I've got some knee inflammation

1352
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:51,019
I work hard my body you know I'm a tall

1353
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:53,059
dude you know you put it at the lower

1354
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:55,519
back pain and pain going on at this age

1355
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:59,150
what would you recommend teacher wise

1356
00:52:55,519 --> 00:53:01,820
for a guy in my condition um honestly

1357
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:03,349
like wonder ones are the way to get like

1358
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:07,760
one to one so when you get off of work

1359
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:08,900
and some high CBD low THC you know if

1360
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,190
you need to take it throughout the day

1361
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,970
you know it'll it'll prevent any

1362
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:15,858
inflammation if it's towards the end of

1363
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:17,869
the day it'll help bring anything down

1364
00:53:15,858 --> 00:53:20,960
that you have

1365
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:23,179
it'll help relax your muscles so if

1366
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,619
you're stiff you know you you know you

1367
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:27,500
won't have that stiffness

1368
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:30,469
I think CBD is a great way to start in

1369
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:32,809
the morning especially do you juice or

1370
00:53:30,469 --> 00:53:35,119
do you you know are you like crap lately

1371
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:36,769
exactly honest truth a vegetarian that

1372
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:46,909
eats like crap that's okay

1373
00:53:36,769 --> 00:53:55,670
it's all your my favorite okay that's

1374
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:58,329
yeah that's good that's alright I can

1375
00:53:55,670 --> 00:54:02,180
reroute us do you recommend utilizing

1376
00:53:58,329 --> 00:54:04,340
reclaim in tincture or edible form okay

1377
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:06,489
so yeah let's be honest you know if you

1378
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:09,108
I would suggest if you're you know

1379
00:54:06,489 --> 00:54:10,729
medicating or whatever you drop downs

1380
00:54:09,108 --> 00:54:12,920
are essential for collecting reclaim

1381
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:15,289
because you don't want to collect some

1382
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,480
reclaim that's had water through it and

1383
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:20,690
have to it's just a whole process right

1384
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,250
want that humidity but anyways yes it's

1385
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,650
been proven that you know I've seen

1386
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:27,769
reclaim test high as 63 percent you know

1387
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:29,869
THC so and that's activated oil so yes I

1388
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:31,690
mean it's not fully activated but at

1389
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:34,279
that point it pretty you know

1390
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:37,130
recollecting it and putting into a

1391
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,960
container and then you know activating

1392
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:40,519
it for a bit longer well really I mean

1393
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,010
they create it's great food great you

1394
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:45,199
know clean it up properly make sure all

1395
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:48,830
the moistures out of it you know add

1396
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:50,529
your oil carrier you know you're a fat

1397
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:53,000
carrier whatever you want to call it and

1398
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:54,410
you're good to go on your edibles you

1399
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,300
know or your capsules for that matter

1400
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:58,429
you keep talking about activating can

1401
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:01,430
you teach us about decarboxylation and

1402
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:03,099
activation okay so decarboxylation d

1403
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:06,039
carving your oil

1404
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:08,449
so depending on whether you're doing for

1405
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:09,949
CBDT a man is gonna be pissed that's

1406
00:55:08,449 --> 00:55:14,719
pasetta scholar with her like a month

1407
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:18,019
ago all right so when you're de carbón

1408
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:20,480
for certain oils you can D carb for a

1409
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:24,739
more sedative oil you know like you can

1410
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:27,320
convert CBD or THC oil onto CBN and it's

1411
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:29,599
just like it's beyond sedative I mean

1412
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,519
it's beyond indica plus you know so it's

1413
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,329
like sleepy time for sure okay

1414
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:38,000
like sleepy time tea times do you know

1415
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:39,920
which is great or you know you can do

1416
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,849
shorter D carbs at different

1417
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,889
temperatures to stay within that not

1418
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:50,269
break that acid barrier so when you

1419
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:53,659
decarboxylate something there's an oil D

1420
00:55:50,269 --> 00:55:55,849
carboxylic acid which accounts for a

1421
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:57,799
certain percentage so when you do that

1422
00:55:55,849 --> 00:56:00,019
you're gonna obtain a loss it's like

1423
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,519
minuscule you're not gonna notice it but

1424
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:04,039
you need to know like you know when you

1425
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:06,110
see the bubbles coming up out of your

1426
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:08,559
oil and stuff that's the car ballistic

1427
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:12,289
acid you know coming up and you know

1428
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,150
leaving you know the the oil so that you

1429
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:18,050
you know a lot of people assume that

1430
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:19,579
that it's a solvent or something you

1431
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:21,440
know arises but if you started with

1432
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:22,880
clean oil that's not the case if you've

1433
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,369
already got that there's no solvent line

1434
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,890
yeah exactly or you know you know

1435
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:30,739
depending on the situation and then I'm

1436
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:32,599
actually starts t carboxyl eating all

1437
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:34,219
the solvent list stuff so I've never

1438
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:36,529
really done a lot of that cuz I've you

1439
00:56:34,219 --> 00:56:39,889
know focused on butane extractions

1440
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:41,150
mostly or isolate concentrates so it'll

1441
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:42,710
be interesting to see I don't think you

1442
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:45,980
should be too different with the rosin

1443
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:47,840
but yeah wouldn't you think the rosin

1444
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,579
has kind of already activated a little

1445
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,100
since it's been through so much heat see

1446
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:53,989
that's the thing I'm taking you know

1447
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:55,670
half grams from all these different

1448
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:57,189
presses and I want to get them tested

1449
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:59,720
for that reason but from what I've seen

1450
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:02,960
even from like soil ground stuff and

1451
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:05,149
other people I haven't seen it's not

1452
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,000
fully activated okay even the chips come

1453
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:10,070
in at like fit like that raw the reclaim

1454
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,070
the rosin chips are coming in at like 30

1455
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:15,599
to 50 percent you know you can do an ISO

1456
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:17,400
soak or even better

1457
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,318
what I would do personally if you guys

1458
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,838
to the rosin you guys are big collectors

1459
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:23,818
is to cannabutter with your rosin chips

1460
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,828
wow you know because that's do you gonna

1461
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:28,650
you can break it all down almost like a

1462
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:29,970
mulch and just you know double up on

1463
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,749
your cheese cloth and you're filtering

1464
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:35,338
you know if you're a CD like me and

1465
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:37,379
it'll make some great butter for edibles

1466
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:40,679
like hands-down announced tonight real

1467
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:45,479
good body I use it all no absolutely I'm

1468
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:47,818
a total fan of an advocate of using the

1469
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:49,759
whole plant that's why we're actually

1470
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:52,949
growing some of them with just water

1471
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:55,889
straight water no needs so that we can

1472
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:57,629
juice those this couple of sweets you

1473
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:00,328
know and we can say like no animal

1474
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:03,390
by-products pray with any nothing just

1475
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:07,019
straight our oh yeah so we're excited

1476
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:11,308
about that I'm going to pull something

1477
00:58:07,018 --> 00:58:14,159
up so that we can get a little specific

1478
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:15,150
with the decarboxylation like it we're

1479
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,379
gonna learn a whole bunch of stuff here

1480
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,880
you guys be patient while he searches

1481
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:20,068
he's got a little bit of information to

1482
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,479
pull up for us so you guys can use your

1483
00:58:20,068 --> 00:58:24,058
reclaim and he mentioned using a drop

1484
00:58:21,478 --> 00:58:25,679
down we often forget that some of our

1485
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:26,910
friends are not dabbers and they don't

1486
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,318
dab daily and they might be in other

1487
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:30,978
states where the toilets flush the wrong

1488
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:33,179
way and the weed grows upside down um

1489
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:34,468
yeah our Australian friends I might have

1490
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:36,568
said States - and he's in another

1491
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:38,639
country that's not a state if I'd

1492
00:58:36,568 --> 00:58:40,710
actually had states like I stupidly

1493
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,719
thought it was just Australia and I lost

1494
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:46,139
you and there's like no parts of you

1495
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:49,170
didn't find out Sydney in other places

1496
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:51,268
No so a drop down you guys a drop down

1497
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:53,309
will go on you're normally where the

1498
00:58:51,268 --> 00:58:56,068
nail would go you put a drop down in

1499
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:57,450
there it's a piece of glass that comes

1500
00:58:56,068 --> 00:59:00,150
out where the nail would go and it

1501
00:58:57,449 --> 00:59:01,919
angles down and then it angles back up

1502
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:03,329
to where your nail or your email could

1503
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,759
go on it and it just puts the nail a

1504
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:07,680
couple inches away from your face and it

1505
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:09,389
also makes a nice place to catch the

1506
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,248
reclaim oil so that it doesn't end up in

1507
00:59:09,389 --> 00:59:12,538
your rig water so that's what a drop

1508
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:14,818
down is when he was talking about a drop

1509
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:16,920
down earlier shout out to my friend

1510
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:18,329
Rasta said in Australia thanks for the

1511
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,818
support it was good seeing you on

1512
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:22,229
Facebook live

1513
00:59:19,818 --> 00:59:25,050
fox is diligently searching for this

1514
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:31,769
information here okay so

1515
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:36,090
we're gonna talk TT first so boiling

1516
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:37,500
point for TT would be 15 degrees

1517
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:40,559
Fahrenheit and that's what that would

1518
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:42,809
start to boil off okay so and that's

1519
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:47,670
when it starts to convert yes and that

1520
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:49,889
will convert it to if there's any CBD to

1521
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,990
convert to that's what it would work but

1522
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:56,489
let's go back to the THC so you would

1523
00:59:51,989 --> 01:00:00,689
want to be between 290 and 310 degrees

1524
00:59:56,489 --> 01:00:05,599
Fahrenheit 290 and 310 yeah because

1525
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:10,019
that's between the CBCA and THC barrier

1526
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:12,118
CBCA is another compound we can that's a

1527
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:13,530
whole nother three arrow conversation

1528
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:15,360
but we can get into that so we'll have

1529
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:17,490
that one yeah and I totally that's fun

1530
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,500
let's just orc talk to me but anyways

1531
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:22,019
getting back to that so that will

1532
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:24,389
activate your Delta 9 which is obviously

1533
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:26,579
your eight Bob people don't know it's

1534
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:29,069
also an anti-inflammatory appetite

1535
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:32,159
stimulant and tea emetic anti profollica

1536
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:33,630
and antioxidant on top of you know all

1537
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,618
the wonderful things that it does with

1538
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,619
cancer

1539
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:44,819
that being said depending on how long

1540
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,010
you go on the d carb you can over you

1541
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:50,130
know you can burn your oil so you have

1542
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:54,240
to be careful of that you know going for

1543
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:57,690
the longer d carbs but I've G carb boils

1544
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:59,729
for you know three hours six hours eight

1545
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:02,490
hours just to see just to get the C word

1546
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:04,889
as the Senate of effect comes out where

1547
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:09,659
the burn out you know we're really or my

1548
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:11,690
burning things out you know and I you

1549
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:14,670
know you can dakar below for let's say

1550
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:17,159
90 minutes you know and but honestly I

1551
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:19,320
would say 180 minutes is you know a good

1552
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:24,000
starting point I really like to look at

1553
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:25,619
it every every [ __ ] every 45 to 60

1554
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,170
minutes to see how it's doing you know

1555
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:29,608
cuz every oil that you start with is

1556
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,139
different it's not gonna be my whole

1557
01:01:29,608 --> 01:01:33,900
you're using I'm not gonna be using your

1558
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:36,000
oil so I'll tell you these you know

1559
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,530
times and mindsets

1560
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,980
just keep in mind and keep an eye on

1561
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:43,440
everything and once all the D carbolic

1562
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:46,650
acid I hope I'm saying that right sorry

1563
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,720
from that little medicated you know

1564
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:52,700
comes out of the oil and what you're

1565
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:55,379
left with is you know this D carved

1566
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:57,119
goodness that is fully activated you

1567
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:58,710
know and depending on what temperature

1568
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:02,190
points that you're hitting you're either

1569
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:07,500
activating for CBD you're activating for

1570
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:09,119
terpene rich activated oil it all

1571
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,769
depends you know it's like you can just

1572
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,599
play around here temperatures and have a

1573
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:14,789
completely different product depending

1574
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:16,739
on what you do how is what so if I had

1575
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:18,509
some really if I had my drop-down I had

1576
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:20,179
some reclaim and I'd collected a

1577
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:23,490
substantial amount now I want to

1578
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:24,989
activate it 2d carbon and I want to get

1579
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:27,359
it to this temperature how do I do that

1580
01:02:24,989 --> 01:02:28,289
do I just put it in a pyrex dish and

1581
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,079
maybe throw in the oven

1582
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:33,570
is there a tech to this yeah you want to

1583
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:36,389
share okay to make it really easy and

1584
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:39,059
just like you can call it low-tech or

1585
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:41,429
whatever so get yourself to Target or

1586
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:43,349
Walmart or whatever your I don't you

1587
01:02:41,429 --> 01:02:45,659
know I don't care who you go to but any

1588
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:49,170
place that sells Pyrex and try to find

1589
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:52,639
small like [ __ ] I don't even know what

1590
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:57,840
kind of little Bowl it is like a little

1591
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:59,339
Pyrex like a little salsa Bowl yeah yeah

1592
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,070
like like like a little pampered chef

1593
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:03,780
yeah exactly you know though Suliman a

1594
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,760
few different sizes try to get a small

1595
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:09,900
one if you can cuz you know just make it

1596
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:12,180
easier and then you can take your drop

1597
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:14,900
down when it's full or gunked up and

1598
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:17,639
take a torch to it and when I mean that

1599
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:19,470
very you know gently just torch it a

1600
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:23,940
little bit until you can see the oil

1601
01:03:19,469 --> 01:03:27,329
moving excuse me and then you can pour

1602
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:28,950
all the oil into the little ramekin Cup

1603
01:03:27,329 --> 01:03:31,829
or whatever that's the word we're about

1604
01:03:28,949 --> 01:03:35,039
yeah I think so yeah the Pyrex ramekin

1605
01:03:31,829 --> 01:03:36,559
and yeah after that you know after

1606
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:40,050
you've got that all poured in you know

1607
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:42,360
be very careful not to be no crack your

1608
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:45,300
drop down you know there's easier ways

1609
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:48,750
to do you can put the jar down in the

1610
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:50,490
and let it get you know warm and pour it

1611
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:52,860
out or whatever but don't try this at

1612
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:54,629
home yeah yeah this way just kind of

1613
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:56,099
works a little bit easier you know just

1614
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:59,280
taking a light little flame to it

1615
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,779
watching the oil move it'll all dump out

1616
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,440
and then you can start getting to work

1617
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:07,650
on that yeah after you do carpet you can

1618
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,630
you know add your carrier oil I always

1619
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:12,329
like to so once we've got it into the

1620
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:14,550
Petrie are the the ramekin ya know what

1621
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:16,679
do we do with it okay now you've got it

1622
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:18,660
in there you set your temperature

1623
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:20,549
depending on what you need you can

1624
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:23,279
actually if you guys want to learn

1625
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:26,700
something you can Google cannabis

1626
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:29,070
activation chart and you'll see a bunch

1627
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:31,919
of different pictures and graphs and

1628
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:33,570
it'll kind of give you an idea of you

1629
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,010
know where you want to go most people

1630
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:38,370
like I said are just activating you know

1631
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:41,730
for the THC and that's great so you know

1632
01:04:38,369 --> 01:04:43,500
like I said so let's say an even 300 180

1633
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:45,559
minutes you know just pop it in the oven

1634
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:49,320
yeah pop it in the oven

1635
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:51,059
let's do its thing some people like to

1636
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:56,460
add the carrier oil before they D

1637
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:58,230
kharbut I like to decarbonize my carrier

1638
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:01,829
oil to it you know whether it's gonna be

1639
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:04,050
off kado coconut grapeseed flinch you

1640
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:06,659
know whatever grapeseed oils and

1641
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:08,850
sunflowers you know there's a bunch they

1642
01:05:06,659 --> 01:05:11,519
each depending on the patient whatever

1643
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:14,400
the hell that alright there's something

1644
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:17,940
thankfully guaranteed a fat that your

1645
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,860
body can take yeah so needless to say

1646
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:22,349
you know there's ways around whatever

1647
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:25,340
but yeah so you put it in the oven you

1648
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:30,079
know you set your time you check on it

1649
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:32,940
once it's ready you know you add oh and

1650
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:36,960
let's back up a little bit before you

1651
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:38,429
put it in the oven weigh it out know how

1652
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,369
much this you're working with that makes

1653
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:44,369
it super easy so you're working with 7

1654
01:05:41,369 --> 01:05:46,109
grams 3 grams or whatever you know how

1655
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:47,730
much coconut oil you're gonna put in you

1656
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:50,519
want to weigh that out too that will

1657
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:53,250
make it a lot easier okay have a weight

1658
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:55,500
specific ratio that you can work with

1659
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:58,018
sometimes I go really low you know like

1660
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:01,068
one gram to seven grams you know and or

1661
01:05:58,018 --> 01:06:04,318
less you know just to kind of get it to

1662
01:06:01,068 --> 01:06:05,880
this wonderful you know all for

1663
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:12,058
consistency depending on what we're

1664
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:13,920
doing you know that being said once

1665
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:15,509
that's added once once you have your

1666
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,789
numbers and everything's weighed do

1667
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:21,088
everything we talked about set it set in

1668
01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:23,369
your petri dish or your ramekin cup put

1669
01:06:21,088 --> 01:06:27,119
it in the oven D carbon for X amount of

1670
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:30,358
time add your oil make sure that you

1671
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,740
know it's it's bonded that the separator

1672
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:34,440
you can put it back in the oven for just

1673
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:37,078
a little while and then you know follow

1674
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:39,750
the recipe if what to whatever you're

1675

yeah yeah yeah yeah but sometimes that's

1682
01:06:54,268 --> 01:06:57,149
the best way that you can apply it to

1683

baby and they wanted to know how I feel

1709
01:07:47,759 --> 01:07:53,278
and what information I had on cannabis

1710
01:07:49,889 --> 01:07:55,018
and pregnancy and honestly as a STONER

1711
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,518
dude I really haven't thought too much

1712
01:07:55,018 --> 01:07:58,709
about cannabis and pregnancy I don't

1713
01:07:56,518 --> 01:08:00,508
feel that that's a lot of my business

1714
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:02,250
I shouldn't be preaching anything about

1715
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:04,949
that but do you have an opinion on it

1716
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:07,409
yeah I do

1717
01:08:04,949 --> 01:08:08,879
first of all let me start by saying you

1718
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:09,389
know a woman's body is her own [ __ ]

1719
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,980
business

1720
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:15,509
absolutely I'm not one to say [ __ ] but

1721
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:19,560
I'll tell you my experience with it so

1722
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:21,420
my ex-wife the mother my child had

1723
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,000
horrible morning sickness like holy [ __ ]

1724
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:25,619
you'd just she wasn't able to work she

1725
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,588
wasn't able to work at her job and she

1726
01:08:25,619 --> 01:08:30,988
was a banker at the time it was it was

1727
01:08:28,588 --> 01:08:32,850
really affecting her what helped you

1728
01:08:30,988 --> 01:08:35,879
know was some cannabis in the morning

1729
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:39,150
you know this is we weren't this is this

1730
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:41,819
is back Oh way back yeah eight nine

1731
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:44,429
years ago you know I was 10 years ago so

1732
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:46,289
it people weren't up on the clean oil

1733
01:08:44,429 --> 01:08:47,960
game the way that we are for the most

1734
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:50,069
part you know Miami what if the cases

1735
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,289
you're lucky to get good fire whatever

1736
01:08:50,069 --> 01:08:55,639
the case is and that's what it was

1737
01:08:52,289 --> 01:08:57,810
so at first it kind of made me

1738
01:08:55,639 --> 01:09:01,920
interesting to think you know how it

1739
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:03,690
affect our child but seeing you know my

1740
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,850
partner in pain and not being able to

1741
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:07,138
work or literally I'd be able to stand

1742
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,310
up straighter she would have to run to

1743
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:10,170
the bathroom and throw up

1744
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,969
cannabis is what helped you know like

1745
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:14,009
literally just a single puff or two

1746
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:16,109
would hold her over for six to eight

1747
01:09:14,009 --> 01:09:18,810
hours you know it was awesome it was not

1748
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:21,088
like a heavy you know doshas knee it was

1749
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:24,150
really even back then and may have

1750
01:09:21,088 --> 01:09:25,859
helped me see the medical attributes

1751
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:29,539
that we weren't seeing you know beyond

1752
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:33,838
getting high so my opinion on it is

1753
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:34,590
ladies I when it comes to the dabbing

1754
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,769
you know

1755
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:37,770
[Music]

1756
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:43,130
that I approve of anything made with

1757
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:47,509
solvents because we've yet to see these

1758
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:49,579
effects on infants and I mean as adults

1759
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:51,829
you know we we do we do them and you

1760
01:09:49,579 --> 01:09:53,720
know regardless of whether it's clean to

1761
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:55,550
the state standards and I mean you know

1762

1764
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:04,010
body versus that few ounce fetus yeah

01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:06,380
affected completely different thank you

1766
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:08,420
residual solvent absolutely so when it

1767
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:10,460
comes to that you we can talk dry sift

1768
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:13,010
bubble and at the same time you know

1769
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,350
unless that bubble hash or the full

1770
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:19,239
melts has been microbially tested or

1771
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:22,130
anything like you know you have to be

1772
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:23,179
beyond anal about your meds you know and

1773
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:26,930
I can't stress that enough

1774
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:29,210
you know so so if if we had some clean

1775
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:30,619
Rasta Jeff grown medicine that you know

1776
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,970
it was clean it wasn't sprayed with

1777
01:10:30,619 --> 01:10:33,979
anything funky it was grown with love

1778
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:35,840
with organic nutrients and then I

1779
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:38,389
harvested it and I passed it off to Fox

1780
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,489
and Fox made some clean but we'll just

1781
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:42,560
stick with the flour yeah would then at

1782
01:10:40,489 --> 01:10:44,119
that point would you approve of pregnant

1783
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,390
mom smoking a little flower

1784
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:50,960
yeah yeah of course and you know my ex

1785
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:54,260
girlfriend got pregnant and you this is

1786
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,180
after we got separated and it did tear

1787
01:10:54,260 --> 01:11:00,500
me up because she was a hardcore dabber

1788
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:02,450
and I'm like but at the same time she's

1789
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,399
a medical patient or in regard to cancer

1790
01:11:02,449 --> 01:11:06,979
survivor and she's here you know having

1791
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:10,460
her second child Who am I to say because

1792
01:11:06,979 --> 01:11:13,759
I'm not sure you know that's the other

1793
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:15,619
thing too that with my opinion so and

1794
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,829
she ended up having a beautiful little

1795
01:11:15,619 --> 01:11:20,510
girl like just the picture-perfect you

1796
01:11:18,829 --> 01:11:24,260
know picture of it of a little beautiful

1797
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:26,329
child and I can't say [ __ ] same with my

1798
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:29,239
daughter I ended up with a gorgeous

1799
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:31,609
little girl I'm super grateful and like

1800
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:34,460
nothing in my little kid's brightest

1801
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:36,559
[ __ ] you know I'm I'm super blessed to

1802
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,670
have a little smartass knucklehead on my

1803
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,070
hands I've got a smartass

1804
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:42,469
twelve-year-old daughter as well yeah

1805
01:11:40,069 --> 01:11:45,229
her her mob didn't consume much cannabis

1806
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:47,328
during pregnancy because her claim was

1807
01:11:45,229 --> 01:11:50,000
that when she inhale smoke she's

1808
01:11:47,328 --> 01:11:51,380
depriving the fetus of oxygen so that

1809
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,179
was why she didn't want to smoke but she

1810
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:55,069
did have a little bit of a edible if I

1811
01:11:53,179 --> 01:11:56,389
remember one time well you know there's

1812
01:11:55,069 --> 01:11:58,219
been like posts and stuff I've been

1813
01:11:56,389 --> 01:11:59,779
seeing I follow some of these mom groups

1814
01:11:58,219 --> 01:12:01,969
and stuff because of the CBD stuff

1815
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:03,738
obviously and there's obviously a lot of

1816
01:12:01,969 --> 01:12:07,069
posts about the pregnancy and smoking

1817
01:12:03,738 --> 01:12:10,189
and fetuses don't they're in the womb

1818
01:12:07,069 --> 01:12:14,059
you know their lungs are developing

1819
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:16,969
they're not taking in oxygen from the

1820
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:19,219
from the air outside they're taking in

1821
01:12:16,969 --> 01:12:22,550
what mom because they would drown in

1822
01:12:19,219 --> 01:12:25,578
amniotic fluid right yeah exactly so

1823
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:28,820
that's that's been proven so there goes

1824
01:12:25,578 --> 01:12:30,259
that to the debate and I just think with

1825
01:12:28,819 --> 01:12:32,448
everything that we've been lied to about

1826
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,889
cannabis as well you know like you know

1827
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:35,029
what's the point of time Philip Morris

1828
01:12:33,889 --> 01:12:38,630
thought it was okay for you to have a

1829
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:40,670
smoke you know yeah so so that regard

1830
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:43,609
I'd love for there to be some research

1831
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:45,710
done on it you know I would never in my

1832
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:47,809
opinion would I ever turn away a patient

1833
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:50,569
that was pregnant because you're from me

1834
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:52,070
because of my opinion no I would totally

1835
01:12:50,569 --> 01:12:54,799
do everything I can to offer them the

1836
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:57,078
cleanest meds to dab or smoke or you

1837
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:01,520
know preferably vaporize you know just

1838
01:12:57,078 --> 01:13:04,130
me personally I would just go out of the

1839
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,340
way to suggest the cleanest forms of

1840
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:08,960
medication edibles tinctures

1841
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:12,170
vaporization you know that you can

1842
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,550
provide I like your approach let the

1843
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:15,109
women do what women feel like they

1844
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:18,469
should do because we are not women nor

1845
01:13:15,109 --> 01:13:22,130
doctors yeah so to my listener who asked

1846
01:13:18,469 --> 01:13:24,560
what we feel about I'm trying to find

1847
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:25,909
some information on it there's not all

1848
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,280
the information is conflicting there's

1849
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:30,109
no real studies there are hearsay

1850
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:32,328
studies I think but I don't think

1851
01:13:30,109 --> 01:13:33,738
there's any like actual this lady smoked

1852
01:13:32,328 --> 01:13:35,420
all nine months of her pregnancy and

1853
01:13:33,738 --> 01:13:37,578
this lady didn't hear his baby a and

1854
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:40,250
baby B I haven't seen that yet well

1855
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:42,889
there's been a study done about testing

1856
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:44,810
breast milk and they took the breast

1857
01:13:42,889 --> 01:13:46,760
milk of women who never [ __ ] smoked

1858
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:48,170
cannabis and their damn lives let alone

1859
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,440
in the generation like where you're

1860
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:49,300
headed

1861
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:51,129
yes

1862
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:56,310
they found natural cannabinoids in

1863
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:59,199
breast milk so here's my theory you know

1864
01:13:56,310 --> 01:14:01,360
those people that don't need to smoke

1865
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,489
cannabis or don't have a big involvement

1866
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:05,769
with it and then I look at them like

1867
01:14:03,489 --> 01:14:07,659
health wise and they seem to have a

1868
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:10,600
healthy endocannabinoid system that's

1869
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:12,159
self-regulating there's no problem you

1870
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,260
know whatever the case is that's

1871
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:17,409
obviously not the case of some of us you

1872
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:19,510
know as we need to regulate whatever

1873
01:14:17,409 --> 01:14:20,800
whether we need to work whether we need

1874
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:22,750
to relax whether we need to calm down

1875
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,980
and we do it with this beautiful plant

1876
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:28,750
because our body's inability and

1877
01:14:25,979 --> 01:14:31,719
deficiency of natural reoccurring

1878
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:32,979
cannabinoids back involved fall under

1879
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:35,140
whether your breast motor that's a whole

1880
01:14:32,979 --> 01:14:36,279
nother [ __ ] conversation but back to

1881
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,630
my point

1882
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:40,899
so there's natural cannabinoids in

1883
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:43,260
breast milk a can or heard to when

1884
01:14:40,899 --> 01:14:46,569
you're doing having clean medicine to

1885
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:49,480
enrich and nourish your natural you know

1886
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:51,759
milk to give your offspring if it's only

1887
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:54,309
building and helping them have better

1888
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,970
antibodies and helping them build better

1889
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:59,320
you know immune systems and whatnot and

1890
01:14:56,970 --> 01:15:03,730
also giving them a better chance of not

1891
01:14:59,319 --> 01:15:04,329
having deficiencies in those senses so

1892
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:07,479
yeah again

1893
01:15:04,329 --> 01:15:09,039
I'm all for more study yeah of that you

1894
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:10,689
know the main point of life is to

1895
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:12,460
survive so I think once that child's

1896
01:15:10,689 --> 01:15:14,289
born it will consume that breast milk

1897
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:15,760
that breast milk has cannabinoids in it

1898
01:15:14,289 --> 01:15:17,470
what happens when you consume a lot of

1899
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,550
cannabinoids you get hungrier right yeah

1900
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,840
so what are you gonna want to do you're

1901
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:22,150
gonna want to consume more breast milk

1902
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,680
what are you gonna do grow stronger get

1903
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:25,960
stronger then what's it gonna want or

1904
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:28,210
breast milk yeah yeah so hopefully

1905
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,569
she'll be on City but hey great for the

1906
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:30,970
baby

1907
01:15:28,569 --> 01:15:32,529
hey yeah well so there's my two cents on

1908
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:34,300
that I'm sorry if it's like a little

1909
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:36,489
awkward about it but you know like your

1910
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:38,829
approach thank you you know I you know

1911
01:15:36,489 --> 01:15:40,539
I'd love to see more research done I'd

1912
01:15:38,829 --> 01:15:43,539
love to see here's what I love to see

1913
01:15:40,539 --> 01:15:47,130
I'd love to see more moms justifying the

1914
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:47,130
science of it and being more

1915
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:55,630
explaining explaining the situation

1916
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:57,430
better as opposed to just like taking a

1917
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:59,710
picture of their tit out and their kids

1918
01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:01,090
mouth and like saying that they're you

1919
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:02,739
know opposing something like do you no

1920
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:04,480
one cares we're beyond that let's get to

1921
01:16:02,739 --> 01:16:05,979
you know and I'm talking about cannabis

1922
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:08,199
Bob's not just moms in general you know

1923
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:11,829
like I get it and don't care like

1924
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:14,769
treated titty whatever like anyways

1925
01:16:11,829 --> 01:16:18,100
who's afraid of titties yes obviously a

1926
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:20,140
lot of people are people who say people

1927
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:22,150
that are afraid of cannabis exactly so

1928
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:25,450
yeah dude you know all four women doing

1929
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:27,729
that with cannabis you know and like I

1930
01:16:25,449 --> 01:16:28,840
said their show tinters [ __ ] trans

1931
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:30,969
journals um

1932
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,500
I know of a mom that used like natural

1933
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:34,420
hemp products to not get any [ __ ]

1934
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:36,430
stretch marks and she blew up like a

1935
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:38,170
damn whale and didn't stretch her

1936
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:40,539
[ __ ] skin at once I'm sorry to be

1937
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:43,390
blunt about cannabis I will not use her

1938
01:16:40,539 --> 01:16:45,399
name but shall have to Canada yeah and

1939
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:47,380
but just saying you know even on a hip

1940
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:49,689
on a hemp CBD scale it can just help

1941
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:51,670
your skin again the a Kenobi of more

1942
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:54,219
colorful pregnancies so why not you want

1943
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:55,569
to be comfortable you know you want you

1944
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:59,110
don't want to be stressed at all at that

1945
01:16:55,569 --> 01:17:00,699
time so if cannabis CBD products you

1946
01:16:59,109 --> 01:17:03,189
know can help you do that and they can

1947
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:05,079
you know I think that's a lot better

1948
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:08,139
than I don't really know the science of

1949
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:10,390
prenatal drugs but they make me a little

1950
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:12,520
curious yeah you know with all the

1951
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:14,350
vaccinations and all the crazy [ __ ] that

1952
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,970
we have going on with autism and other

1953
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:18,340
things like that it just makes me

1954
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:20,680
curious and nervous so you know go

1955
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:22,630
cannabis go cannabis that is a great way

1956
