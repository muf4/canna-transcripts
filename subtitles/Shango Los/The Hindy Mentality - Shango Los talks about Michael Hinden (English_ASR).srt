00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,420
hi there friends Shango from shapingfire

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,719
here and I'm here to tell you about the

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,118
Hindi mentality of Michael hinden so

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,640
Michael's Hindi mentality was made up of

7
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,980
four parts as I saw it the first one was

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,320
clean information Michael had the

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,140
cleanest information in an industry full

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,640
of Bro Science like cannabis was

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,620
Michael's the guy who went and found the

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,659
original research right and it wasn't

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,218
just cannabis too it doesn't matter if

14
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:45,238
it was like talking about like you know

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:49,439
a cannabis breeding or or botany in

16
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:51,899
general or you know dog breeds or you

17
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,299
know some kind of technology or gotta

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,698
help you engineering or the planets or

19
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,399
anything right we all know that once you

20
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,500
start talking to Michael about any topic

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,539
you could end up anywhere else it was

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,118
always an adventure talking with him but

23
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,739
he always had clean information he

24
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:09,780
always had had you know a couple books

25
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,339
he had read about the topic or and he'd

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,040
gone back and found the scientific

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,780
papers behind it and and then he

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,880
provided you with links right so you

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,140
could read that stuff too so so it was

30
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,019
beautiful he had the cleanest

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,579
information of anybody number two he

32
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,379
developed those into best practices

33
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:26,759
right like like just knowing the

34
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,039
information wasn't enough he always

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,959
wanted to know how to apply

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,100
um this knowledge that he got and so he

37
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,019
would put together best practices

38
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,500
whether or not it was you know about

39
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:39,899
cannabis breeding or diet or exercise or

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,938
or you know you know of anti-fragility

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,859
and how he wanted to build the systems

42
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:45,298
of his life right I mean we've all heard

43
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,978
this from him

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,159
um he was always wanting to figure out

45
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,899
how to apply this how-to that he was

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,479
picking up from these these books and

47
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,640
documents so then three he would do this

48
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:00,299
kindness in Sharing right he was always

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,140
sharing and um he he did it in this way

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,060
that was accepting of wherever I was on

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,560
a particular topic you know he didn't he

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,199
didn't blow me out of the water with

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,000
information he would start slow and kind

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,039
of gauge where you were at as a listener

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,739
and then he would change change the

56
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,859
vocabulary and how deep he got based on

57
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,560
who you were and so he was always

58
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:27,000
connecting with people at at their level

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,580
to spread his information and

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,560
um and the best practices that he had

61
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,879
developed because he wanted everybody to

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,979
grow good plants you know he wanted

63
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,959
everybody to have a good life he wanted

64
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,299
everybody to have reduced suffering and

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,900
and Michael absolutely believed that

66
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,239
good information was at the key to you

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,860
know like decreasing suffering

68
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,959
um so then and then the last part was

69
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,239
like his Joy right his just joy in

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,280
living everything that Hindi was doing

71
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,099
he liked doing

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,199
um you know he put joy in everything he

73
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:59,579
got up and he lived his day with joy if

74
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,018
he was going to a con you know a

75
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,920
conference or something he was joyful

76
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,300
there

77
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,518
um you know if you're just getting tacos

78
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,439
with him right he was he was happy about

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,780
having tacos with you

80
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,658
um and and it's that approach to life

81
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,878
that really made Michael stand out to me

82
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:16,979
and then once we got talking all the

83
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,658
information stuff filled it in and

84
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,299
really you know became the base of a

85
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:24,539
basis of our friendship so so you know

86
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,000
what the Hindi mentality means to me in

87
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:30,000
that clean information beautiful best

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,818
practice is that he shared kindly with

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,158
other resulting in a joyous life that

90
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:37,259
that he lived from beginning to end so

91
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,979
uh yeah that's uh that's the Hindi

92
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,979
mentality to me
