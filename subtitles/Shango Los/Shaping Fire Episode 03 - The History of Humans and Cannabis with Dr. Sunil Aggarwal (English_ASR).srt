1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:10,259
we are at a very awkward time in the

2
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,870
relationship between the cannabis plant

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,669
and humans we've been using cannabis for

4
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:17,009
health and spirituality for millennion

5
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,589
yet because of the last 80 years or so

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,830
of prohibition modern generations barely

7
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,509
know the plan at all as a society we are

8
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,538
gonna have to go through a process of

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,730
relearning how to use the plan how best

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,949
to grow and hybridize her for medicine

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,020
and of course we're gonna have to undo

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,270
all of the reefer madness fed to us by

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,739
the US government and institutional

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,620
players like pharmaceutical companies

15
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,449
and law enforcement now that prohibition

16
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,609
is unraveling in the u.s. we have

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,260
stopped strong-arming other nations to

18
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:48,679
fight cannabis in their own countries -

19
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:52,679
and now their freedoms are increasing

20
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:54,448
Ukraine Mexico Colombia Costa Rica the

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,789
Czech Republic and many more countries

22
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:59,159
have varying forms of cannabis freedom

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,808
and it is spreading globally at a fast

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,238
rate now that the US has stopped

25
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:04,859
bullying everybody of course there is

26
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,859
Portugal - who shocked the world and

27
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:10,560
legalized all drugs in 2001 and has seen

28
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,599
an addiction drop by 50% in violent

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,509
crime rates dropped - not to mention

30
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:18,239
everyone is much happier what we do not

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,829
yet have in the u.s. are updated social

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,539
mores for how to talk to each other

33
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,849
about cannabis how to think about

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,799
cannabis as medicine and how to build a

35
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:28,559
business model for distribution that

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,118
will work to the benefit of all sure in

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,400
the cannabis activists scene we have

38
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,780
much of this figured out for today but

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,579
as more and more humans bringing

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,890
cannabis into their lives what is

41
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:41,429
accepted socially will all change again

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,950
and again today's guest is dr. Sunil

43
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,899
Agarwal he is a medical geographer and a

44
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,359

conventions all over the world

48
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:55,500
cherry-picking his accomplishments to

49
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,140
describe him to you was really hard

50
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,299
because he's done so much right now he

51
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,549

Medical Association to call for a review

68
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:43,060
of the scheduling classification of

information summary on cannabis and

74
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,750
cannabinoids finally he is associate

82
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:16,899
even half of his bio it's an honor to

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,719
have dr. Sunil Agarwal on shaping fire

84
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,209
so for today let's look at the big

85
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,280
picture let's go back way back and

86
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,699
consider the historical roots of

87
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,530
cannabis and humans we will go back

88
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:32,199
30,000 years and page through the story

89
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,229
of the love affair between humans and a

90
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,449
plan named cannabis sativa

91
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:39,280
welcome to the show Sunil hey it's great

92
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,629
to be here Shango I'm glad I'd really

93
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,299
appreciate you making the time to join

94
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:45,519
us today so I want to start at the very

95
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,290
beginning you know at the green flower

96
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,539
medical cannabis summit you were

97
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:52,000
painting a really wonderful image of

98
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:54,729
perhaps how cannabinoids came into

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,430
existence like 38 million years ago

100
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:59,738
as a protective response to the

101
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,139
increasing UV radiation from the Sun I

102
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,700
really enjoyed hearing that would you go

103
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,669
ahead and share that perspective with us

104
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,798
again right now oh yeah I'd love to yeah

105
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:11,079
that this is something that I read in

106
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,060
some a you know a geography book that

107
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,359
has to come out nicely recently from a

108
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,500
University of New Mexico professor and

109
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,269
really just trying to understand the

110
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,819
deep history of cannabis bio

111
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,668
geographically we're evolved and when it

112
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:27,219
evolved and you know so it's just

113
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:30,879
because part of what we what people have

114
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,950
lost is a connection of cannabis to the

115
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,409
the natural world the biosphere like the

116
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,810
web of life that we're all part of and

117
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,600
that was kind of the context I was

118
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,360
giving that that history and when I

119
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,330
spoke at the at the summit trying to

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,189
make that illegal alien nature of

121
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:50,050
cannabis back to like hey you know this

122
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:53,379
is part of reintegrating it back into

123
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:56,319
our sense of Earth so you know the this

124
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:58,329
this advanced wind pollinated plant that

125
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,040
we know now as you know cannabis with

126
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:02,620
two new sexes and occasionally

127
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,800
hermaphrodites it evolved in a part of

128
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,360
the world central south southern asia

129
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,389
based on you know archeological evidence

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,879
based on on genetic evidence and you

131
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:15,250
know the interesting thing is that it's

132
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,310
evolved in a place that actually at the

133
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,959
same time it was evolving it was also

134
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,418
evolving in a place that was getting

135
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,939
higher and higher elevation every year

136
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:27,250
because it came at a time when the earth

137
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:30,600
itself was going through a radical

138
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,889
transformation whereby at that time the

139
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,550
indian subcontinent

140
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:38,349
actually had not joined asia and there

141
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,530
was a period of time about 15 million

142
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,419
years ago when that plate collided with

143
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:45,009
the Asian landmass and you had the

144
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:47,978
formation of the Himalayan mountain

145
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,599
range and that was you know one of the

146
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:51,579
you know the tallest mountain range in

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,470
the world and and there at the same time

148
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:56,649
you have this cannabis plant that's

149
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,770
evolving in the same time and how do you

150
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:01,029
survive in a place where you know every

151
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:04,719
year the elevation is getting higher and

152
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:08,199
higher as a plant and one theory is that

153
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,790
it has to create chemicals to protect

154
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,639
itself from the damaging effects of

155
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,560
ultraviolet radiation I really sorry go

156
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,289
ahead you know and that's that's that's

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,660
what it is and and that's just you know

158
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,640
does not just hurt cannabinoids about

159
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,110
terpenes but cannabinoids especially

160
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,469
have these very nice properties so

161
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,720
that's a that's what but probably one of

162
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,640
the theories and I was really attracted

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,060
that story because you know it really

164
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,459
respects the plant itself is having its

165
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,129
own life story because we always talk

166
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:40,719
about what the plant can do for us but

167
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:42,850
but really the plan

168
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,860
itself has its own story and you know it

169
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,230
eventually comes in contact with humans

170
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,970
and and we start to cultivate it and it

171
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,640
starts to influence us and then we start

172
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,290
to influence it but but it's got its own

173
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,680
storyline as well and I think that's a

174
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,210
great place to start if you're

175
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,090
absolutely right you know it has to it's

176
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:03,969
it's it evolved it has to survive and it

177
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:06,849
did a very very good job it thrived and

178
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:10,420
it adapted and that's part of I think

179
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:12,520
how why it is so Hardy and able to adapt

180
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,129
in so many places because it it kind of

181
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:18,279
has this cauldron of great stress under

182
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:21,069
which it it was formed so you know um

183
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:23,859
you know most people don't see cannabis

184
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,480
as being the long-term cure that we've

185
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,460
always used you know except for maybe

186
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,379
the last 80 years or so they don't

187
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:32,560
really think about that you know

188
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:35,199
cannabis was a central component of the

189
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,060
modern pharmacopoeia but also that that

190
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,099
we humans have been interacting with

191
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,589
this plant for tens of thousands of

192
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,650
years I know you like to talk about you

193
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:46,839
know the place that the plant has you

194
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,370
know in human history will you walk us

195
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,379
through the human relationship with

196
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,280
cannabis over the ages to to put the

197
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:56,709
modern prohibition in context Oh

198
00:07:53,279 --> 00:08:01,000
certainly it's a it's quite a vast and

199
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:02,859
long story so anything can I say in this

200
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,910
short time will not do full justice but

201
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:10,419
I mean you know okay I guess the place

202
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,860
to start really is is that it you know

203
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:14,349
where it evolved in that part of the

204
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,120
world is where people started you know

205
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,879
first coming into contact with it and

206
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,418
domesticating it you know in South Asia

207
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,579
where my ancestors are from 18,000 years

208
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:27,490
ago you've got that's the earliest

209
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:29,680
dating of signs of domestication of

210
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,560
cannabis that could have been some other

211
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,990
records or in earlier places earlier

212
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:39,009
times in that same region but you know

213
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,979
that at that time you know we don't know

214
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:44,799
but the earliest writings that we get

215
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,710
from from that civilization that

216
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:51,849
reference cannabis it's very much in the

217
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:53,870
context of healing which is not distinct

218
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,080
from spiritual growth we

219
00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:00,230
development and the idea that you know

220
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,440
you can't that the two are separate in

221
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,930
is it's kind of a modern fallacy I guess

222
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,180
you can say and in those days there's

223
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:11,239
really no distinction between the idea

224
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:13,969
of you know achieving certain states of

225
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,690
spiritual development meditative states

226
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:20,000
states of self-awareness states of peace

227
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,310
tranquility and sense of healing which

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,620
is you know pretty transformative and

229
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:28,129
fundamental to to cure I mean if you if

230
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:31,370
if disease is it comes from the word

231
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:33,200
dis-ease not to not be at ease and you

232
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,970
have something that's potentially part

233
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,490
of you know putting people at peace

234
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,560
that's that's kind of the fundamental

235
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,990
stamping out of disease is where where

236
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:46,099
it came or disease is where it came into

237
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:48,700
play but certainly also it was seen the

238
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,990
development of our Vedic medicine

239
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,800
traditional medicine systems such as

240
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:58,850
there were systems called inany and TB

241
00:09:53,799 --> 00:10:00,799
which kind of came from Persia and of

242
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,778
other historical influences and cannabis

243
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,789
found homes and those traditional

244
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:06,919
Chinese medicine cannabis found a home

245
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:09,860
there's a suggestions from the Ebers

246
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,719
papyrus which is the one of the oldest

247
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,860
medical documents that we have which

248
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,389
comes from ancient Egypt there are

249
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,730
formulas for the use of cannabis and and

250
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:22,490
there it's much more you know analgesic

251
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:26,990
much dealing with relieving pressure in

252
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:29,180
the eyes or pain in the eyes so it it

253
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,480
still had a dual role both in this

254
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:34,669
spiritual realm and in kind of dealing

255
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,389
with pain dealing with problems of

256
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:43,009
inflammation and I guess over the ages

257
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:44,750
that that this is cannabis spread

258
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,610
through the parts of the world where

259
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,339
those forms of systems of medical

260
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,350
practice were were used Chinese medicine

261
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,440
UNAMI medicine Persian medicine Indian

262
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:59,540
medicine they went around the ancient

263
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,339
world and I think you know in there was

264
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:05,120
there was early writings of the use in

265
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:06,950
prevention of seizures from much older

266
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,459
times in Syria and

267
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:12,259
there's a the the first citations that

268
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:14,109
the like if you look at the government

269
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:16,309
of India it has a traditional knowledge

270
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,259
library digital library where they're

271
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:20,599
trying to record all the traditional

272
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:22,039
uses of plants and things in there and

273
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,320
their heritage so that they don't get

274
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,000
scooped up by big companies that say oh

275
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,379
we came up with that first or something

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,649
you know they're trying to establish

277
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:35,088
prior art they make reference to I

278
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:41,870
believe it's a 12th century textbook by

279
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:42,889
a guy named it Ben Minh Sinha it been

280
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,149
sent out he has different names

281
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:45,860
depending on which part of the world

282
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,539
you're in but this guy's textbook of

283
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,089
medicine from that time era from the

284
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:53,990
sort of the Arabic Renaissance was

285
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:56,690
widely read all over the both the east

286
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,459
and the west it was taught at like

287
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:02,360
Oxford and you know even in the old

288
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:03,559
monastic European traditions so this is

289
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,680
the citation that I think they

290
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,379
intentionally use to show that this this

291
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:11,509
very well-known Arabic scholar of

292
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:14,360
medicine and many other things was

293
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:16,129
citing cannabis and its medical uses and

294
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,070
it was being read both in the east and

295
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:22,009
the west so that that kind of was I

296
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,260
think a big recognition that the most

297
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:27,078
advanced forms of medicine into the

298
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:28,610
Renaissance in the medieval period

299
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:32,349
you know cannabis was part of that I

300
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:36,079
think the next big wave that you can say

301
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:38,209
where we finally get much more wider

302
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,458
exposure in the nineteenth it happens in

303
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:42,500
the nineteenth century and and there was

304
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:44,088
ongoing use and other throughout the you

305
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,208
know the centuries before between the

306
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:48,500
19th and the 12th centuries and you know

307
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,818
I don't want to go go into all this

308
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,559
there's so many different details that

309
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:53,889
we can look at with witches and and

310
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:57,109
traditional herbalists and Europe and

311
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:58,698
indigenous uses in other parts in Africa

312
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,870
and other places that don't get a lot of

313
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:05,659
attention but I guess it's big its big

314
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:10,639
moment in the Sun so to speak happens in

315
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:14,088
the 1840s when due to the British East

316
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,269
India Company's you know activities in

317
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:18,740
India they are able to import into India

318
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:20,870
leading medic

319
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,419
doctors from the 19th century who were

320
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,429
trained at the top academies of Medicine

321
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:27,620
in Europe in those days which was the

322
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:30,169
University of Edinburgh in Scotland and

323
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,409
that's where you got dr. William

324
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:35,360
O'Shaughnessy who trained in Edinburgh

325
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:36,679
and really this was a center of medical

326
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,169
training not just in Europe but also

327
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,729
people in the United States would go to

328
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:43,159
train in Edinburgh in those days because

329
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,920
there really wasn't big centers in the

330
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:48,199
US and those time so anyway this doctor

331
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,240
who was already kind of a genius Irish

332
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,089
doctor who had figured out the treatment

333
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,589
of cholera who nobody had ever had

334
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,020
figured out that oh boy we should

335
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:58,880
probably give IV fluids to cholera

336
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,889
victims with with electrolytes in them

337
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,820
so that they don't dehydrate to death

338
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,458
you know

339
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,940
from diarrhea so that was his like you

340
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:10,429
know doctoral thesis and a pretty pretty

341
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,380
brilliant discovery it probably saved

342
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:15,019
many lives

343
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:16,370
and he then was he got a lucrative

344
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,569
position in the British you see new

345
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,860
company they said we want you to go to

346
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,959
Calcutta which is our where our

347
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,060
headquarters are in India at that time

348
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,669
the prezi capital of the British India

349
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:28,699
and we want you to set up a modern

350
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:31,099
medical college and this is the oldest

351
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,589
modern medical college in Asia now it's

352
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,170
still in operation and he established it

353
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:38,690
and he was able to he was such a kind of

354
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:42,199
polygon and thoughtful man that he said

355
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,810
hey let's let's bring in let's try to

356
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,640
develop the principles where we can

357
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:49,039
teach in the native tongue to the native

358
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,659
Indians which is great I mean it's their

359
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,099
call colonialists after all so they

360
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:55,028
don't always have a high regard for

361
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,860
native ideas but they did and he did and

362
00:14:55,028 --> 00:15:00,470
as part of that process of establishing

363
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,089
chemistry department and the college he

364
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,278
said you know I really need to learn the

365
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:05,540
local medicines so we can kind of we

366
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,009
don't have to import all of these from

367
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:09,199
Europe and we can kind of learn from

368
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:11,600
them and learn from Indians so he

369
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,120
started seeing the use of cannabis in

370
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,500
the marketplaces the local [ __ ] and

371
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,778
healers and he said well this is this is

372
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,519
an interesting compound and he started

373
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:25,129
experimenting with it in medical

374
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,990
students and animals and finally in

375
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,850
patients and you know he kind of made

376
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,259
his career at least the first half of

377
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,550
his career he was as a brilliant guy

378
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,950
that he has actually many

379
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:36,620
first to his name but he wrote a paper

380
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,170
that in the 1830s that that got

381
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:42,589
international currency on the use of

382
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:44,208
cannabis indica or ganja Indian hemp you

383
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:47,810
know and he covered lots of different

384
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:49,699
conditions convulsions tetanus some

385
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:53,028
conditions that infantile convulsions

386
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,890
and tetanus and outs of terminal rabies

387
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:57,919
again we're conditions where there

388
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:59,028
actually was no cure but because we

389
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,429
didn't have you know modern antibiotics

390
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:04,939
in those days antivirals or you know

391
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:06,559
inoculum but you know he was able to

392
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,920
bring a lot of relief to people who

393
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,299
otherwise would die very horrible deaths

394
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,610
you know and I'm unable to eat or drink

395
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,259
because of the convulsions from from

396
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,310
terminal rabies when it gets into your

397
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:21,379
nervous system or severe stiffness from

398
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:23,869
from tetanus when it gets really

399
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:25,189
advanced and he's able to relax those

400
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,110
muscles and allow people to eat and

401
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,290
drink and and of course he did have

402
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,350
other you know younger patients who

403
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:35,659
survived convulsions so that that kind

404
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,360
of thing was a was was excellent because

405
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:40,699
his discoveries really launched modern

406
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,269
the use of cannabis in modern medicine

407
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,490
and I think you know we've just had a

408
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:50,000
trajectory since that time where it's

409
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:53,269
it's come and gone and it achieved

410
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,620
another peak really it it started

411
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,708
peaking at the late 19th century early

412
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,929
20th century leading doctors from around

413
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:01,489
in the early 20th century doctor William

414
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:06,619
Osler who's the father of internal

415
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,759
medicine doctor Gower who basically did

416
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,549
some of the earliest studies in

417
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,828
Parkinson's doctor Reynolds who first

418
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:15,289
established the typology of seizures

419
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:16,578
epilepsy disorders who was Queen

420
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:19,039
Victoria's physician all of these

421
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,139
leading doctors you know founded founder

422
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,789
of Johns Hopkins University they all

423
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,350
knew cannabis and they all knew it was

424
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:26,240
an important part of their armamentarium

425
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,639
thanks to the work of O'Shaughnessy and

426
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,660
their own research on on it and use in

427
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,520
their patients so that finally that area

428
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,460
kind of came to an end in the 40s when

429
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:40,250
early forties when the you know federal

430
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,549
it got political and you know there was

431
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,048
a increasing now the United States was a

432
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,970
colonial power

433
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:49,940
this is one theory you know it was had

434
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,919
taken over the Philippines they had

435
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,820
started using you know dealing with

436
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:59,269
Mexico much more they actually you know

437
00:17:55,819 --> 00:18:01,489
I think they saw cannabis in a different

438
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:04,128
light now associated with people that

439
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:06,558
they were trying to control and you know

440
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:09,528
it became much more of a political

441
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,528
football and the medical arts around

442
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:14,720
cannabis started falling out of favor

443
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:16,009
there was also a move to more industrial

444
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,749
medicine a little bit more

445
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:20,389
pharmaceutical eyes diversion of

446
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:22,069
medicine and you know even though there

447
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:23,689
had been attempts to grow cannabis in

448
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:28,730
the United States for pharmaceutical

449
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:31,700
purposes somehow it just didn't take so

450
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:34,460
only ultimately that we have to wait

451
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,009
until really the 70s and 80s and then

452
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,139
now in the peak 90s and beyond that now

453
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:41,858
we're having this next cycle of

454
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:45,019
emergence and this time we are much more

455
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:47,358
prepared and much more us you know we

456
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:49,819
can learn from the history and we now

457
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:53,928
have this endocannabinoid system science

458
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:56,239
that has developed in the late late late

459
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,369
part of the 20th century that really

460
00:18:56,239 --> 00:19:00,499
changed everything I mean now we finally

461
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:02,028
have a deeper understanding of actually

462
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:04,308
on a molecular level

463
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:06,470
what are these cannabinoids that are in

464
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:07,608
cannabis that evolved all those thirty

465
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,159
eight million years ago what are they

466
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:13,069
doing in our human bodies that was an

467
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,629
epic answer Sunil and no wonder no

468
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,398
wonder you've got a dry throat that was

469
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:19,849
that was awesome I'm so glad that we got

470
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:22,699
that recorded the the picture that you

471
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:25,148
just painted from 38 million years ago

472
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,830
to us learning about the

473
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:29,599
endocannabinoids system in the 90s and

474
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:32,210
then what's happening with modern

475
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,189
medical marijuana that's an epic picture

476
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,778
you just painted and because your answer

477
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,769
was so full we need to take our first

478
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:38,480
short break right now

479
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:42,470
we'll be right back you are listening to

480
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,179
shaping fire using pesticides when

481
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,460
growing cannabis has been common for a

482
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:49,190
long time nowadays though we know better

483
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,960
we know that most pesticides formulated

484
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,909
for food crops have never been tested

485
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,308
for use with cannabis they've been

486
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,570
tested to be eaten in tiny doses they

487
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:58,970
have not been tested to be

488
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:01,730
inhaled and especially not concentrated

489
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,409
into a cannabis oil chemical residues

490
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,120
from pesticides are not healthy for

491
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:07,759
anyone but they are especially dangerous

492
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,859
for patients for commercial cannabis

493
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,288
growers this has become very impactful

494
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:14,449
cannabis enthusiasts and patients have

495
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:17,569
gotten educated enough that they avoid

496
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:19,429
growers who used pesticides not only

497
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:21,888
that but states across the country have

498
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:25,490
begun making pesticide testing mandatory

499
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:27,168
on all licensed cannabis crops the time

500
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,269
has come to find a better way to fight

501
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,159
garden pests than covering your cannabis

502
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:35,288
and chemicals and there is a better way

503
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:37,639
let some good bugs fight your bad bugs

504
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:39,440
beneficial insects and predatory mites

505
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:41,689
have come a long way since we were

506
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,610
buying ladybugs online and putting them

507
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,149
in the grow room and just hoping for the

Shango lows and our guest this week is

530
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,240
dr. Sunil Agarwal

531
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,409
so Sunil before the break we were

532
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,960
talking about how you know the medical

533
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:56,659
cannabis has come to us through the ages

534
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,850
and now in the modern world when we know

535
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:02,259
about the endocannabinoid system that

536
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:04,638
that we are more prepared to learn about

537
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,649
the influence that this beautiful plant

538
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:08,418
can have on our body well you know

539
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:10,729
animals study evidence showing

540
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:12,528
cannabinoids kill cancer

541
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,569
started to begin to accrue in the early

542
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:16,669
70s you know why do you think that

543
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:19,038
institutional actors like the US

544
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:21,320
government and especially major cancer

545
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,480
study nonprofits aren't focusing on

546
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:26,148
cannabis and talking more about it

547
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,240
publicly and even excitedly they just

548
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:31,489
seem to be ignoring it yes it's a sad

549
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,200
thing and given how much the leading

550
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,960
causes of death in the country now our

551
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,619
cancers and you know in many other parts

552
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:43,579
of the world we really have are missing

553
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:46,220
an incredible opportunity to study and

554
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:49,038
develop treatments that involve cannabis

555
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,659
and I think we we kind of I mean it was

556
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,849
starting to get in the 70s there was a

557
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:55,909
big interest in funding on cannabis

558
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:59,259
research going on there was a interest

559
00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:02,990
in the National Institutes but you know

560
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:05,450
politics one over there was a sense I

561
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,909
think that you know the Nixon

562
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,649
administration was like well we don't we

563
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:11,059
don't really want to get that stuff out

564
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:12,109
there too much because we are I'm

565
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:14,509
already using this as a tool for

566
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:17,538
oppression against anti-war protesters

567
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:20,419
and you know I really I've studied the

568
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:22,538
Nixon tapes where they actually he talks

569
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:25,278
about his motivations and he tries to

570
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:27,440
fire the people who are at the world's

571
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:30,528
leading Medical Research Institute the

572
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,179
NIH who have argued that you know the

573
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:33,888
restrictions are too much and there

574
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:36,048
needs to you know the harms have been

575
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:38,778
exaggerated and you know we should not

576
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:41,868
be treating this like kryptonite or you

577
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:44,148
know nuclear material but unfortunately

578
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:46,878
he was not that was not part of his his

579
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:48,498
mission and I don't think that he was

580
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:51,349
and his administration was somebody that

581
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:52,669
didn't have any you know compassion for

582
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:53,990
cancer patients you can actually hear

583
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:56,749
other recordings where he talks about

584
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,308
hey you know it'd be it's terrible what

585
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:59,749
happens to cancer patients they should

586
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:02,658
have all the pain relief that they need

587
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:04,220
and you know I think it's just there was

588
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:05,929
just such a fundamental lack of

589
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,450
awareness and understanding that

590
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:13,548
cannabis could could offer anything of

591
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:15,379
value beyond getting has he talks about

592
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:17,480
it getting charged getting buzzed is

593
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:19,548
getting you know and that was that was

594
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,608
the view of it that it was just this

595
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:23,058
total escapist you know it didn't have

596
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:25,730
anything

597
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:28,009
any serious value to it despite the fact

598
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,288
that you know doctors and folks above

599
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:32,538
him or smarter than him we're telling

600
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:36,319
him otherwise so I think that's why the

601
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:38,599
initial research got really got shut

602
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,908
down or it didn't get renewed or

603
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,709
developed there was other movements

604
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:44,419
going on again it was always the idea

605
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,370
well can I have a noise who owns that

606
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:48,710
who's gonna make a bunch of money off of

607
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:50,569
that how do we gonna mass supply that in

608
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,950
that same time in the 70s is when you

609
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:55,329
started seeing the development of

610
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:58,278
chemotherapy and modern chemotherapy and

611
00:24:55,329 --> 00:25:00,859
you know it was it was done in at the

612
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:03,230
NIH the first use of met was called

613
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:07,278
methotrexate to treat a certain form of

614
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:11,360
cancer that women who get pregnant can

615
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:13,099
get choriocarcinoma and I mean I think

616
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,658
people would just you know they just

617
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:17,388
didn't they didn't understand how could

618
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:19,820
a boyd's work they didn't understand you

619
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:21,019
know how we could produce that in a big

620
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:23,898
way because it was too much of a

621
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:27,230
political football and unfortunately you

622
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:28,579
know we dropped that thread now at the

623
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,710
same time there was increasing awareness

624
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:33,319
in the 70s that cannabis had a role for

625
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,179
palliation in cancer and that started to

626
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:38,839
start did start to spread in multiple

627
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:40,249
states Tennessee even states that today

628
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,558
aren't medical cannabis states like

629
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:44,659
Tennessee you know how to get cannabis

630
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,428
medical cannabis and cancer program

631
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:47,659
people figured out that it could help

632
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:49,970
them with the nausea and vomiting

633
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:52,580
associated with these new chemotherapy

634
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,829
drugs and that was going on for a while

635
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:58,638
and then you know they shut that program

636
00:25:54,829 --> 00:26:01,970
down and during you know in the 90s and

637
00:25:58,638 --> 00:26:04,069
and when the new war on drugs got it got

638
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,558
it going under Reagan and then the first

639
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:07,849
Bush and then the AIDS patient salts

640
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,220
that were trying to get in at that time

641
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:12,498
too and that got shut down so all of

642
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,118
that all the political factors got into

643
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:15,860
the way that stopped us from really

644
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:18,259
moving forward on these things and it

645
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:22,128
took it took passage of California's

646
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:23,749
medical cannabis law in 96 till to force

647
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:26,388
the federal government to start allowing

648
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:30,919
modern clinical trials research in

649
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:33,168
cancer in cancer and also in HIV thanks

650
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:34,879
to the work of Donald Abrams at UCSF I

651
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:36,480
mean he cited the passage of the

652
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:38,339
California law and his letters

653
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,470
to the National Institutes to get them

654
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:42,689
to do something to approve his studies

655
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,058
which they finally did so there was that

656
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,130
big long lapse so we that was kind of a

657
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:50,519
Dark Ages period of research and now

658
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:53,610
there's been a really even to this day

659
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:55,798
because of the powers that be and the

660
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:57,928
funding streams in the United States we

661
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:01,558
have not put a significant amount of

662
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:03,679
resources in in the cancer and the

663
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:07,289
cannabinoid logic approaches to cancer

664
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,240
area even though there was big moonshot

665
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:11,879
initiative that the vice-president just

666
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,279
did Joe Biden you know or we several of

667
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,020
us put in suggestions to the government

668
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,389
you know you need to fund this type of

669
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:21,058
research I mean this is there's a huge

670
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,410
promise in multiple types of cancer it

671
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:24,660
just didn't it didn't come up in their

672
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,370
latest report as a priority area they're

673
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,080
they're looking at more you know they're

674
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:30,178
looking at data sharing registries

675
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,579
they're looking at immunotherapies and

676
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:37,380
all these things again I think there's a

677
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:40,349
lot of you know economic like sort of

678
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,840
issues there that go into play but other

679
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:45,058
countries are developing cancer and

680
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,099
cannabis research you know they did a

681
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:50,339
study in Israel where they looked at the

682
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:52,649
use of cannabidiol to prevent what's

683
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:55,859
called graft-versus-host disease which

684
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:59,519
is a horrible complication of a cure for

685
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:02,159
cancer so people get what's called stem

686
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,720
cell transplants I'm a typo extensive

687
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,429
transplants and they can get cured from

688
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,190
blood cancers and they're looking at

689
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:09,390
other disorders too and it's a great

690
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,029
thing you know when you can kind of

691
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,040
reset your bone marrow and blood and if

692
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:16,410
you had a fatal blood cancer like

693
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,450
lymphoma leukemia you know and you can

694
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,120
treat it and cure it with it with a stem

695
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,190
cell transplant but then sometimes you

696
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,678
can get a reaction where the the graft

697
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,929
of your of your transplant attacks your

698
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,900
own body graft-versus-host disease and

699
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:32,790
it's a very severe complication you know

700
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,040
you get a lot of pain weakness stiffness

701
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:37,710
and it could make your life call it'd be

702
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,779
terrible and they did a phase two study

703
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,240
where you know cannabidiol had a huge

704
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:47,399
impact in prevention of that condition

705
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,920
in you know in patients who got these

706
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,410
stem cell transplants a 300 milligram

707
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,390
a day starting at a few days before

708
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:57,210
transplant and until 30 days after

709
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,400
transplant they really had a huge

710
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,289
reduction in the likelihood of

711
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,710
developing the most severe forms of GVHD

712
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:06,690
that would been in Israel in Australia

713
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:10,440
and I think New Zealand they're doing

714
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:13,590
more research on cannabis compounds and

715
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,250
actual treatment of cancers UCSF did a

716
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:19,409
glioblastoma study so I'm seeing a

717
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:23,460
renaissance it is happening it's gonna

718
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:27,210
be it's slow but it is it is starting in

719
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,680
humans and I think we are just keep we

720
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,420
have to keep talking about it we have to

721
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,640
keep we have to do much more of it we

722
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,590
have to fund it more and I think really

723
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,300
there needs to be a lot more what's

724
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:37,740
called empiric treatment trials where

725
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:40,349
people we really need to collect a lot

726
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,390
of primary data real good quality data

727
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:44,189
where people are using certain varieties

728
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,560
with certain types of cancer not all

729
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,809
cancer is the same the idea that one

730
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,440
size fits all is really you know not the

731
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:54,269
way that cancer works and I think we and

732
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,460
I don't believe that cannabinoids are

733
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:58,109
you know the sole treatment for things I

734
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,240
think that's that's really foolish

735
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:02,339
cancer is such a complex condition and

736
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,990
there's many things that can be done it

737
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:08,279
needs to be seen as an integrated part

738
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:10,920
of cancer treatment and I think we we

739
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:12,389
really are you know still very behind

740
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,529
I'm very hopeful I think the National

741
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:18,210
Cancer Institute has taken on

742
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:20,759
cannabinoids in cancer and put up a very

743
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,279
thorough review for the public and for

744
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:24,539
doctors health professionals and that's

745
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,339
a pretty bold move you know that's

746
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,779
government-funded and that's they go

747
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:29,639
through a lot of details of the

748
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:31,529
mechanisms by which cannabinoids kill

749
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,320
cancer which is by the way a very unique

750
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,549
mechanism you know those warned about

751
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,009
some of the problems that we have in

752
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:39,539
cancer treatments is that so many other

753
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:41,579
cells suffer when you're trying to kill

754
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:43,619
cancer cells and what's unique about

755
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:46,109
cannabinoids is oftentimes they are very

756
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:48,179
targeted and that's pretty nice you

757
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:50,219
leave your healthy cells alone and you

758
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,500
you know target the ones that are that

759
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,730
are causing the problems so Sunil you

760
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,650
know one thing I want to ask you before

761
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,200
we go to break that I've always you know

762
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:01,710
been curious about is that you know when

763
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,690
I learned to what degree cannabinoids

764
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,278
can

765
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,369
and you know start to cause apoptosis

766
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:09,440
and and you know stop this spread of

767
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:12,259
cancer cells and and that there was

768
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,950
something there right it astonished me

769
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:18,979
and continues to that there are so many

770
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:21,139
majorly funded cancer nonprofits that

771
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:23,509
that say up front that you know we will

772
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:25,998
find a cure for cancer and and we're

773
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:27,769
funding all this Cancer Research and yet

774
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:31,879
you know you don't hear about them

775
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:34,878
talking about cannabis or or pushing the

776
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:36,769
for cannabis or lobbying the the

777
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:39,199
government and it seems to be coming

778
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:43,009
more from patients themselves and and

779
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,538
skipping over these major nonprofits so

780
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:46,489
so if you can kind of give me a short

781
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:48,460
answer before we go to commercial you

782
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:52,278
know why do you think that that that

783
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:55,340
these these large cancer nonprofits are

784
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:58,788
not speaking with a louder voice to to

785
00:31:55,339 --> 00:32:02,168
try to push this research yeah listen

786
00:31:58,788 --> 00:32:07,249
they this is this is a Schedule one

787
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:09,739
status of cannabis marijuana really is

788
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:10,848
there are areas where that doesn't

789
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:12,769
matter and there are areas where that

790
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:16,038
really matters and I think when you when

791
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:19,128
you're talking at this level of official

792
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:21,348
cancer research these these things have

793
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:25,038
a huge impact it really does and I think

794
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:26,778
that's you know we have that's part of

795
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,028
the fundamentalism around around

796
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,348
cannabis that the government maintains

797
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:33,319
you know Schedule one is a type of

798
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:34,999
fundamentalism the idea that there is no

799
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:37,519
safety under medical supervision there

800
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:38,509
is no accepted medical use I know

801
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,470
they're trying to talk a big game about

802
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:45,618
research right now the DEA even but you

803
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:48,379
know the maintenance of that idea is so

804
00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:50,418
far off from what we know and I think

805
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:52,248
it's still very difficult to touch for

806
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:54,559
some of these mainstream organizations

807
00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:57,288
right on that makes a lot of sense well

808
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,940
while you while you take a drink of some

809
00:32:57,288 --> 00:33:00,229
water and rest your voice for a second

810
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,239
we're gonna do another commercial

811
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:05,808
we'll be right back you are listening to

812
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:07,579
shaping fire look inside this crystal

813
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:09,229
ball with me for a moment I'm looking

814
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:12,338
just a couple months into the future I'm

815
00:33:09,229 --> 00:33:16,000
seeing the future of the shaping fire

816
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:18,190
podcast the show sure has grown

817
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,289
I've continued to interview fascinating

818
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,840
cannabis industry luminaries and our

819
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,940
audience has gotten huge it has doubled

820
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:26,980
and redoubled and doubled again there

821
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,890
are high-fives all around the shaping

822
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,230
fire world headquarters new listeners

823
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:34,000
are subscribing every day and begin to

824
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,759
listen to the back catalogue of all the

825

more welcome back you are listening to

847

shaping fire I'm your host Shango Louis

848
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,590
and our guest this week is dr. Sunil

849
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:37,809
Agarwal so Sunil you know the show so

850
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,730
far has been so educational for me you

851
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:42,099
know the first part of the show we were

852
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,168
talking about the the epic history of

853
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:46,569
the plant and and our interaction with

854
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:47,859
it over the centuries and then the

855
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,710
second part of the show we were talking

856
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:53,110
about you know the Prohibition years and

857
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,970
and how the marijuana fundamentalism has

858
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:57,760
still got a hold on us but we're more

859
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:59,949
prepared now to learn from the plant and

860
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,050
how it can work with our endocannabinoid

861
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:03,639
system than at any other time in human

862
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,590
existence and that's you know that's a

863
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:07,599
really great message what I'd like you

864
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:10,120
to do now is you know open your mind's

865
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,219
eye and imagine a future where humans

866
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:14,529
are caring for their endocannabinoid

867
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:16,689
system with supplementation through the

868
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,360
use of cannabis and you know maybe

869
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,429
eating endocannabinoid system enhancing

870
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,440
foods you know what does that society

871
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:25,089
look like what did that what's the human

872
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,940
health look like of those people what's

873
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:30,548
our best-case scenario oh sure

874
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:33,119
well you know III think the important

875
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:36,940
thing is to recognize first and foremost

876
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:40,079
that there is a aspect of health aspect

877
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:43,659
of medicine an aspect of science that is

878
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,430
fundamentally cannabinol aaj achill you

879
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:48,308
know there is there is an a part of our

880
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:52,598
lives a part of our health that is so

881
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:54,869
critically governed by the science of

882
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,609
cannabinoids say knowing the science of

883
00:35:54,869 --> 00:36:00,400
interaction with you know and through

884
00:35:57,608 --> 00:36:02,828
which I mean from which arised or I mean

885
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,190
out of which came out of the study of

886
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:10,030
cannabis so the fundamental role that

887
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:12,010
the plant cannabis and had plays but it

888
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:15,099
goes beyond cannabis too because we've

889
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:17,829
we've found cannabinoids in other plants

890
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:19,480
and we have our own internal cannabinoid

891
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:21,039
signaling system which is even older

892
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,380
than cannabis itself if you look at the

893
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,940
evolution of that so this is a this is

894
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,380
an area I think should be called

895
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:31,420
cannabinol adji and you know I think it

896
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,130
it gets us to sort of recognize that ok

897
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,778
well if this is a central part of

898
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:38,650
biology that helps us regulate our

899
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:41,199
homeostasis and you know it's involved

900
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,990
in mood appetite memory inflammation

901
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,358
pain perception muscle tone

902
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:50,439
you know Berlin growth tumor regulations

903
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:54,068
stress seizure activity G

904
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,809
gastrointestinal function I mean it's

905
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:57,548
it's everywhere it's it's playing an

906
00:36:55,809 --> 00:37:00,180
important role and I think if we

907
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:02,500
recognize that then we can start to

908
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:05,828
understand our health conditions a

909
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,608
little bit more deeply trying to see if

910
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:11,140
there is a dysregulation or a problem in

911
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:14,769
endocannabinoid system either in Oregon

912
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:16,808
or system-wide that might explain like

913
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:18,460
clusters I mean I think dr. Ethan

914
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:20,769
Rousseau who I know you're gonna be

915
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,838
before you know has really done a lot of

916
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:24,699
great work to start thinking seriously

917
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:26,769
about clinical endocannabinoid

918
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:28,838
deficiency syndromes and I think there

919
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:30,190
is a there's a lot to be said for for

920
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:31,989
that when you have certain clusters

921
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:35,760
around migraines interval irritable

922
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:38,379
bowel fibromyalgia and Dmitry osis and

923
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,480
probably many more we'll start to see as

924
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,778
we start studying on a molecular level

925
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,519
genetic

926
00:37:41,778 --> 00:37:45,798
you know endocannabinoid tone and Oh

927
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:48,768
cannabinoid deficiencies we'll get a

928
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:51,559
finer grain understanding and you know I

929
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:53,328
think we was just so that part of that

930
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:55,189
is starting to recognize looking at the

931
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:57,709
health conditions through a cannabinol

932
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:59,719
logic lens and then recognizing that

933
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:03,288
well there's a there's ways that we can

934
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:05,749
can intervene or we can you know treat

935
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:08,778
people can inhabit illogically to make a

936
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:12,438
difference to restore the problems that

937
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:15,079
are you know the funded base line issues

938
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:16,518
that are impairing their health quality

939
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:19,759
of life and their and causing symptoms

940
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:21,498
and issues and I think there's it's not

941
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:23,568
just that it's also preventative health

942
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:24,768
side too but you know we saw that

943
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:26,688
there's two different branches there's

944
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,368
treatment of acute issues and then

945
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:31,338
there's making sure issues don't come up

946
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:34,669
so and and you know making you know

947
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:36,949
wellness so I think I think the the

948
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:39,588
first side of it would be where you

949
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:41,929
integrate cannabinol logic approaches

950
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:43,518
thinking and treatments into all

951
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:46,369
branches of medicines that are relevant

952
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:47,178
I think I think you know we talked about

953
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:51,709
oncology

954
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:52,880
I think neurology Rheumatology I think

955
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:54,379
those these are some of them and you

956
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,809
know pain medicine and palliative

957
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,519
medicine are some of the really and I

958
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:01,278
should also mention rehabilitation which

959
00:38:58,518 --> 00:39:04,578
is my one of my central specializations

960
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:07,989
I think all of those areas are really

961
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:14,749
ripe for having a cannabinol logic

962
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:15,858
approach and I think we just so excited

963
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:17,928
to think about what that would look like

964
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:20,630
if we are starting to say okay you know

965
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:22,429
we're that's one approach that we are so

966
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:25,249
patients who go to clinics or you know

967
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:26,539
they're looking on there or they you

968
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:28,398
know they see their doctors or their

969
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:29,839
whatever allied health professionals and

970
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:31,909
they start seeing that those people

971
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,648
recognize there's a cannabinoid problem

972
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:36,289
at the basis of your oncologic

973
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:37,518
rheumatologic etc problem so let's see

974
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:39,739
if there's a way that we can boost your

975
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:43,038
endocannabinoids activity maybe with a

976
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:46,249
some ratio of botanical cannabinoids

977
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,019
extra whole plant extract and let's you

978
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:49,998
know see how that does for you and

979
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,379
luckily we've done some research on that

980
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:53,268
with people with just your condition and

981
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,460
we found out that you know one to one

982
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:57,799
ratio of THC to CBD within a whole

983
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,568
extraction makes a big difference in

984
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,089
terms of restoring that problem for you

985
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:03,500
I you know we've seen there's been

986
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:05,269
research that shows in multiple

987
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,300
sclerosis patients if they take a

988
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:10,338
one-to-one extract over time they have

989
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,800
they a walk better and they have less

990
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:14,838
emergency room visits and not to mention

991
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,859
better you know pain and spasticity and

992
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:18,440
that's been in double-blind

993
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:19,789
placebo-controlled studies so I just you

994
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,159
know I think it's just a matter of

995
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:24,800
translating what research we do have and

996
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,318
actually starting to roll this kind of

997
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,380
thing out so that people who have these

998
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:31,759
conditions know their providers know and

999
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,530
then the patients directly know and

1000
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,050
there's something available for people

1001
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:38,750
around the corner or in their in their

1002
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,369
healthcare system where that's provided

1003
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,989
for I really believe that local medicine

1004
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:43,490
systems are an excellent way to go

1005
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:46,489
because cannabis can be produced locally

1006
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:49,068
and we can we can start to quantify and

1007
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:51,078
you know make varieties and preparations

1008
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:54,769
that everybody can understand and share

1009
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:57,710
and use and I think ultimately you you

1010
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:59,239
just have a also believe this a great

1011
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,588
therapeutic aspect on the preventative

1012
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:02,298
health side and the kind of

1013
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:04,849
complimentary alternative side where

1014
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:07,940
you're looking at the gardens and

1015
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:09,559
growing green plants and and how people

1016
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,200
can have more interaction with that if

1017
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:13,970
that you know makes their makes their

1018
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,789
days better their pain better their mood

1019
00:41:13,969 --> 00:41:19,219
better and I think that's a nice aspect

1020
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:22,099
to it and then that also dovetails into

1021
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:24,078
the preventive health side what does it

1022
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:26,150
mean to use cannabis instead of alcohol

1023
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,119
or what does it mean to use cannabis as

1024
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:32,650
a tool for yoga meditation spiritual

1025
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,358
pursuits you know a recreational therapy

1026
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:37,539
well how does that you know how does

1027
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,739
that impact overall quality of life and

1028
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:43,519
stress which we know is a big part of

1029
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:45,979
heart disease so I think that's you know

1030
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:48,559
some of this is so hard to to envision

1031
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:52,159
because you just we're still stuck in

1032
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:53,750
this fundamentalism which keeps us keeps

1033
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,058
the relationship with cannabis really

1034
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,219
monopolized or a better way to say all

1035
00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:00,650
ago lop alized and only a few people

1036
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:02,509
have a legitimate access and I think

1037
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,519
whence we recognized and actually you

1038
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:06,619
know this is a Commonwealth we all have

1039
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:09,409
the right to access cannabis and also

1040
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:11,660
have relationships with it not just with

1041
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:14,869
consumption but production and I think

1042
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:17,480
health therapeutic relationships should

1043
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:20,929
be a forefront of that so whatever that

1044
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,579
looks like to you I think there's a lot

1045
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:25,159
of areas I mean I didn't even mention

1046
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:27,920
like infections and diabetes and you

1047
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:30,500
know heart disease stroke prevention a

1048
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,840
dementia preventing and treating

1049
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,199
dementia there's so many exciting things

1050
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:39,110
that could be with the cannabinoids to

1051
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:41,239
hold promise for and I'm just I think

1052
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:44,690
that future is very bright we just you

1053
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:47,889
know we just gotta like collectively get

1054
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:50,630
off this fundamentalism and just do it

1055
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:54,289
that's awesome I love that picture and I

1056
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:56,990
can imagine how you know as as Canas

1057
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:59,090
becomes less stigmatized and this

1058
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:01,279
research that you're talking about is

1059
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:03,410
happening more and more that what we're

1060
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,780
going to be seeing is you know a

1061
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:08,509
decrease of each of these different

1062
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:12,019
categories of human ailments and just

1063
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:13,460
less sickness across the board and you

1064
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:15,860
know and that's really exciting and I'm

1065
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,929
really glad that that you're able to

1066
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:20,630
take time to be on the show today to

1067
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:24,259
kind of put it all on this long timeline

1068
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:26,930
so that we can really look at how human

1069
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,700
health and the cannabis plant are

1070
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:30,529
intertwined and I think that's where

1071
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:31,969
we're gonna stop for today sitting out

1072
