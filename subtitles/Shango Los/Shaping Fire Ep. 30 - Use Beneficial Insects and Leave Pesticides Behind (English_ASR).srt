2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,138
everywhere you look

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,428
cannabis enthusiasts patients and

4
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:14,369
consumers are turning away from

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,289
pesticides most pesticides approved for

6
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,570
growing food are not approved for use

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,449
with cannabis and yet there they are in

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,579
the market all the time these food crop

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,099
pesticides may be tested as safe enough

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,409
in very low doses when watered down and

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,570
outside in the rain on food products but

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,880
most have never been tested to be burned

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,558
and inhaled into the lungs like cannabis

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,780
often is and even more so been

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,109
concentrated like cannabis oil for

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,750
dabbing pesticides run the range of risk

17
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:45,420
from untested for safety when growing

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,390
cannabis all the way to specifically

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,340
toxic when used in cannabis and the

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,670
crazy thing is is that some people and

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,590
even companies still use them many

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,329
growers have grown accustomed to relying

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,850
on chemical pesticides when they get

24
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,829
spider mites or rust at my door any one

25
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,129
of the nasty bugs that attack cannabis

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,200
crops nearly nobody wants to use the

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,510
sketchy pesticides but some growers just

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,939
don't have the experience to rely solely

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,740
on holistic horticultural practices and

30
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,688
that's too bad too because people have

31
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,618
been growing without chemical pesticides

32
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:18,959
for decades

33
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,938
it's just that cannabis happens to be in

34
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,399
a pocket of modern agriculture that has

35
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,109
been late to adopt the damn thing is

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,719
that many states are not even testing

37
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:30,269
regulated cannabis for pesticides they

38
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,969
do it on an honor system and that sure

39
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:34,978
has not worked out well so far when the

40
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,688
state does not test for pesticides it

41
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,299
pretty much makes a mockery of the legal

42
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:41,879
systems claim to provide a superior

43
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,009
product to the black market in the legal

44
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,019
market right now you still have to know

45
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,409
your grower and that's the same thing as

46
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,090
unmet unregulated medical was cannabis

47
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,950
consumers are beginning to get educated

48
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,259
though about pesticides and pesticide

49
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,540
regulation and are starting to demand

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,938
cannabis grown without pesticides and

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,820
using other sustainable growing methods

52
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,618
like using living soil cannabis growers

53
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,688
with vision though have seen this coming

54
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,538
for a long time and many growers are

55
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:11,519
already migrating away from pesticides

56
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,439
and are leading the industry with really

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,740
clean canvas

58
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,060
products that consumers flock to today

59
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,280
we're gonna talk about working with

60
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,590
nature instead of against it we're gonna

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,710
talk about using beneficial insects as

62
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,960
allies to eat the bugs that are pests

63
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,000
and there really is a difference some

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,860
bugs will defend your garden instead of

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,990
destroy it and this is a

66
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,180
well-established agricultural practice

67
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,250
it's not new it's just new to cannabis

68
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,069
like so many other things now that

69
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,169
cannabis is being normalized today we're

70
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,949
going to encourage you to use bugs and

71
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:45,439
not drugs

72
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:47,089
to defend your cannabis garden if you

73
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,919

74

dive deep into cannabis health business

75
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,489

Shango 'lose my guest today is Shane

young Shane founded natural enemies in

89
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,209
2014 to focus on encouraging the use of

90
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,969
beneficial insects in commercial

91
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,920
cannabis prior to that Shane managed two

92
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:27,020
acres and acres and acres of ornamental

93
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,599
greenhouses for a greenhouse growers

94
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,300
magazine top 25 horticulture company

95
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,530
after personally designing transitioning

96
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,870
and running the company's successful

97
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,699
beneficial insects program he chose to

98
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,409
switch gears and bring his expertise to

99
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:41,869
the cannabis industry to help producers

100
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:42,590
reduce residual pesticides in medical

101
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,590
cannabis

102
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,849
welcome to the show Shane hey Shango

103
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,500
thanks for having me on man it's nice to

104
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:50,389
connect again yeah totally it's great to

105
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,780
have you back on so you know for most

106
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:56,389
growers familiar with using insects at

107
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,580
all they're used to using ladybugs and

108
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,559
praying mantis to fight pests in their

109
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,260
garden what are the advantages to

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,780
cannabis growers to move beyond using

111
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:08,269
these traditional bugs and using a wider

112
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,459
range of beneficial insects like the

113
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,830
commercial ornamental horticulture

114
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,180
industry does ya know good question and

115
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,700
when you're talking about preying mantis

116
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,168
and ladybugs those are kind of

117
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,729
generalist per se that you know they'll

118
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:21,319
feed on many different things that may

119
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,450
be in your garden they may not be as

120
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:26,240
aggressive as aggressive as some of the

121
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:28,560
species that we carry though

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,689
what we do at this stage is there's very

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,579
specific predatory mites that are

124
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,750
actually used for you know the pest

125
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,209
concerns that people have in their

126
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,189
operations you know the biggest thing

127
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:40,379
that we go into is we start from the

128
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:42,360
bottom you know fungus gnat issues rue

129
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,250
David's and cannabis and then it goes

130
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,569
into broad mite and rest of mites are

131
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,750
completely you know tearing companies

132
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:51,149
apart because of how how difficult it is

133
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,490
to figure out what you have because the

134
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:55,049
magnification is so small to see these

135
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,699
pests in and then you still have the

136
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,920
common ones you have to spot spider mite

137
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,810
thrips a lot of different things so the

138
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,850
species that we carry are very specific

139
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,800
and I guess they're kind of cultured

140
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,120
specifically for one job in mind and

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,509
that's you know what the pests are that

142
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,350
people have right on why wouldn't I want

143
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:15,509
a more generalized insect to be working

144
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,370
for me instead of a specialist so that

145
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:19,050
it just you know I can use one insect

146
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,329
and it gets rid of all my bugs or is

147
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,620
that just unrealistic no it's a good

148
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,729
question and it makes sense it you know

149
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,168
there's nothing wrong with having a

150
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,939
generalist out there you know it's

151
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:28,889
helpful in a lot of different situations

152
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,660
I guess you'd say but when you have a

153
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,550
specialist you know they have one main

154
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,720
job and that's to get a get rid of the

155
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,160
pests that you have that you're most

156
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,390
concerned with you know what I mean I

157
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,650
mean if you have a ladybug and praying

158
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:39,060
mantis they're not gonna do a whole lot

159
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:41,009
for the microscopic mites that you're

160
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,899
after so you want to use specific

161
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,269
species that are geared towards your

162
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,769
specific pest eradication comes about

163
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:49,109
they clean things up a lot quicker

164
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,490
basically rather than just a generalist

165
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,860
that's roaming around eating basically

166
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,500
yeah that makes sense now I know that

167
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,949
you just mentioned a few of the the

168
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,918
pests that you deal with but I want to

169
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:04,949
get a better picture of of what kind of

170
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,109
pests beneficial insects can be used

171
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,180
against so you know every grower pretty

172
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,259
much has got their archenemy right the

173
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,600
thing that they've been trying to get

174
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,879
rid of on and off for you know some time

175
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,410
you know can you give me a you know an

176
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,149
idea just name off some of the most

177
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,250
common pests that you are working with

178
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:21,929
so people get an idea of oh alright the

179
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,079
one the one that I'm concerned about is

180
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,569
on the list yeah no it's good and it's

181
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,699
been fairly simple to you know compile

182
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,620
this this list of what people's concerns

183
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,509
are you know coming from traditional AG

184
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,220
it was you know very common pest in

185
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,750
agriculture versus when I come into

186
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,020
cannabis it seems like one of the most

187
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,730
common pests

188
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:41,829
we encounter again our from the routing

189
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,540
system you know fungus gnats and the

190
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:45,159
biggest thing about those is that the

191
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,930
larval stages of those will feed on your

192
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,980
routing system of your plants which you

193
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,030
know I believe is one of the most

194
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,350
important part of your plants I mean

195
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,549
obviously the flower on the backend is

196
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,680
great but you know you have to have

197
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,600
healthy plants moving into you know from

198
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,480
mother to veg into your flower room so

199
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,070
plant health is number one and fungus

200
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,590
nets I don't think anybody should take

201
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,810
lightly I mean they spread diseases they

202
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,449
carry other pests with them and they can

203
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,670
spread to a room and you know and can

204
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,139
become real a real issue if you don't

205
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,110
take care of it the biggest thing about

206
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,909
that is what I learned is the amount of

207
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,250
watering you know that the cannabis

208
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,140
plant demand it amazed me because I had

209
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,660
never cultured you know cannabis I'd

210
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,610
never grown it myself and I just recall

211
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,260
working with one of the 502 growers in

212
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,759
Washington that where I gave them soil

213
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,319
mites to take care of their fungus gnat

214
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,459
issues and you know two weeks later he

215
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,990
called me back and told me I was full of

216
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:33,849
[ __ ] basically and I'm like god I'm like

217
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,800
the only reason I know these don't work

218
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,930
is you know they could freeze or if they

219
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,790
could drown out basically so he's like

220
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,439
dude he's like you know how much water

221
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,060
we're feeding our plants at this point

222
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,069
and you know when he told me a gallon of

223
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,250
water for a three gallon bucket every

224
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,899
two days possibly my first thought was

225
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,149
that we were pushing out reproduction

226
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:54,250
basically so we ran some trials we did

227
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:56,289
additional applications to be effective

228
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,699
with these things fungus gnats but you

229
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,890
know what's tearing people apart is rue

230
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,019
de foods as well those are huge pests

231
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,719
that people have problems with and and

232
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:06,099
and you know I'm always honest with

233
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,420
everybody they got to be one of the most

234
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,620
difficult to to get rid of to eradicate

235
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,259
generally when we work with people we

236
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,030
talk about sanitation first we talk

237
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,589
about scoping their soil that they're

238
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,739
bringing in basically you know because

239
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:23,049
eggs can be in that soil so rather than

240
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,970
trying to cure them of a situation with

241
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,129
our product we try to get to the root of

242
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,500
it on you know what can what steps need

243
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,089
to be taken first before we start using

244
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,649
our product moving forward and then it

245
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:36,549
comes to rates at that stage to be

246
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:39,279
effective so fungus gnats rue de fits in

247
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,500
the soils is common is very common on

248
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,029
what we deal with moving forward from

249
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,309
there like I had mentioned earlier you

250
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,139
know to spot spider mite has to be one

251
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:49,839
of the most common pests whether it's in

252
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,639
cannabis or it's like the poster boy of

253
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,110
bugs in cannabis

254
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,429
it's fairly common I mean everybody

255
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,960
should know it a two spots spider might

256
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:58,689
looks like it's been around it's very

257
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,280
visible by the eye it's easy to tell

258
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,110
what it is so pest identification is

259
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,720
simple but yeah it's been around a long

260
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,639
time and from there you know thrips are

261
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,830
very common as well in agricultural

262
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,529
crops regardless of if it's cannabis or

263
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,990
not but a couple the most difficult as

264
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,179
well has been broad mites and the hem

265
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,610
press it might as well and you know I

266
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:20,109
spoke about two spots spider mites you

267
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,730
can easily identify them because you can

268
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,519
see them with your eye depends on how

269
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,050
old you are Shango but you know for the

270
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,490
most part you're gonna need a scope

271
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:29,649
you're any the high-powered scope to

272
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,600
take a look at these things from what

273
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,090
we've gathered 60 plus magnification is

274
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,190
what's needed and you know my old my old

275
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,810
position as a plant health manager I had

276
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,370
the luxury of being twenty minutes away

277
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:40,989
from Oregon State University had a

278
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,570
research facility next to us an

279
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,820
extension service and we were able to

280
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,860
touch base on you know what they use in

281
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,720
research for out in the field and you

282
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,800
know in their in their offices when they

283
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,990
have things so that's where I started

284
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,149
about ten years ago is using specific

285
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,669
scopes in able to have pest

286
00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:00,699
identification and what's actually

287
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:04,029
coming up more that I really didn't

288
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:07,660
focus very much on was is foliar a fits

289
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:09,339
as well it's probably been about in the

290
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:10,839
last three and a half years one percent

291
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,940
of one of the pests that we deal with

292
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,560
but you know this last year it seems to

293
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,480
be like there was a string of growers

294
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,279
that continually ran into it and I don't

295
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,509
know if that is because of our reach at

296
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,699
this point as a company on how many

297
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:24,610
people that we work with where we are

298
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,110
receiving more calls about it but it

299
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,629
just seems like it's a growing pest

300
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,269
concern with people as well right on you

301
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:33,309
know my experience supports what you're

302
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:35,500
saying about the once that once you've

303
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:38,559
got roof a if it's or or some kind of

304
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,600
infestation in the substrate that that

305
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,699
things can go to hell pretty quickly in

306
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,980
my experience once once they're in the

307
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,750
roots the whole plant starts to get a

308
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,330
little you know sick and lakhs of days

309
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,340
ago which creates an opportunity for you

310
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,500
know secondary pest so maybe we can

311
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,660
consider the the root pests to be like

312
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,159
the gateway pest which which you know

313
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:58,959
breaks down the Hort the Trojan horse

314
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,620
through the door and then and then the

315
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,700
secondary pest come do you find that

316
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,610
happening at the commercial level as

317
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,990
well oh yeah no you

318
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,240
you hit it right on the head man I mean

319
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,070
like I spoke about previous a healthy

320
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,320
plant you know sanitation from the very

321
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,790
beginning these are the key step there's

322
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,110
not one thing that you do in pest

323
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,778
management that's going to take care of

324
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,180
all your problems it's a it's a whole

325
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,490
slew of things that go into it you know

326
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:24,958
sanitation general plant health if you

327
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,269
have a problem in your rating system and

328
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,639
you have a weak plant basically it's

329
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,769
it's opening itself up to other issues

330
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,539
concerning no secondary could be disease

331
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:34,589
it could be additional pests because you

332
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,669
know it's kind of like you and I if

333
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:37,649
we're sick we're not at our best

334
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:39,539
basically there's no way for us to fight

335
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:41,159
off other things except we got to get

336
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,349
through it so you know at the commercial

337
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,480
scale for sure man I I think people are

338
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,720
still going through you know even though

339
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,789
I guess recreational use has or

340
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,560
cultivation has been around for you know

341
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:54,588
four to five years maybe six I can't

342
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,729
recall when it passed in Colorado but

343
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,370
you know all these people are still

344
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,259
figuring out how to grow at scale you

345
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,328
know any man in it I can't imagine it

346
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,159
being an easy task at all when you're

347
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:06,750
used to growing 20 plants or 50 or

348
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,129
whatever it may be you know now you have

349
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,389
to manage a team you don't you don't

350
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,458
just get to be with your plants every

351
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:12,629
single day you're doing other things as

352
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,669
well even though you're head of

353
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,990
cultivation or you're just I p.m.

354
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:17,578
management whatever the company may be

355
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,778
there's so many things that need to be

356
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:20,969
done you know we work with people as

357
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:24,659
50,000 plants I mean I can't imagine

358
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,860
even doing that myself so yeah

359
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:27,838
definitely you know to answer your

360
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,060
question in a roundabout way plant

361
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,980
health is great and one of the key

362
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,569
things in using an integrated approach

363
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,699
to pest management with beneficial

364
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,528
insects but yeah you hit it right on the

365
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:40,349
head when you're using beneficial

366
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:42,240
insects to defend your garden do you use

367
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,579
that strategy at all like some growers

368
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,278
do where you you leaves a couple sick

369
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:50,669
plants around as sacrificial lambs to

370
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,850
attract the the the pests or does that

371
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:56,519
just create an environment for new and a

372
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:59,459
you know secondary and original pests to

373
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,289
come into your garden well the way that

374
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,879
I have always been trained is if you

375
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:04,409
have a weak plant you want to get it out

376
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,778
of there you know you don't want to

377
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:09,120
contaminate anything else in your room

378
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,189
because it could bring it to your plant

379
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,409
but also the surroundings of the plant

380
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,930
that's sick I guess you would say

381
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:17,969
so just in you know a training of mine

382
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,839
has always been you know cleaning up a

383
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,970
leave deadly

384
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,220
was dead you know twigs things like that

385
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,210
if it's a sick plant get it out of there

386
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,129
you know cut your losses

387
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,870
sometimes basically and just get rid of

388
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:30,389
it may make things a lot easier for you

389
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,980
moving forward but for the most part I

390
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:33,539
would get rid of it then try to save it

391
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,220
you know when you talk about sacrificial

392
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:37,829
plants you can use companion plants or

393
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,750
beneficial plants basically that can and

394
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,000
this may be outdoors where you can wear

395
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,450
it kind of invites beneficial insects or

396
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,980
the natural you know predatory predatory

397
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,839
insects from the outside into your

398
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,950
garden outdoors indoors it's a little

399
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,260
bit more difficult when people are

400
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,730
working in sealed rooms you know yeah it

401
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,588
kind of doesn't really make sense

402
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,330
indoors but it can be helpful in the

403
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,880
pots you know it goes back to plant

404
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,528
health quite a bit right on so and I

405
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,509
think that the you know the elephant in

406
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:06,799
the room as far as like adoption of

407
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:10,649
beneficial insects always seems to be

408
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:13,679
growers who have relied so heavily on

409
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,360
chemical pesticides for all these years

410
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,819
growing underground during the

411
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,278
Prohibition era you know indoors that

412
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,980
that they have they've worked out their

413
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,720
tech they know their schedule they and

414
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:29,009
and they're like you know they depend on

415
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,950
it to deliver and and now because of the

416
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:34,830
huge pushback both by state regulators

417
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:37,200
and by individual consumers who don't

418
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,839
want chemical pesticides sprayed on the

419
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,610
plants suddenly now you know a lot of

420
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,610
these traditional growers are being

421
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,009
pushed to have to consider beneficial

422
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,379
insects and give up the bottles that

423
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:52,049
they've you know that they've wedded for

424
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:55,470
all of these years you know what do you

425
00:14:52,049 --> 00:15:00,059
say to these growers that are clutching

426
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:02,430
on to their chemical pesticides to help

427
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:05,219
move their heart if you will away from

428
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:08,399
using what they've relied on move them

429
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,800
towards what is a more holistic solution

430
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,309
and working with nature how do you get

431
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,778
them over the hump of belief it's a

432
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:17,579
great question and it's obviously

433
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:19,970
something that we deal with on a daily

434
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,830
basis you know and you know not to

435
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,240
defend people who want to use sprays in

436
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,310
their garden because things have worked

437
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,659
well in the past but you know to say

438
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:29,549
something about that a lot of people

439
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,469
that's been their only option that's

440
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:32,309
what they're that's what they know you

441
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,050
know anything that's helped

442
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:35,039
people are trained at this point you

443
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,809
know bein at the company I was that

444
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,730
previous to my and he you know we had a

445
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:40,229
we have a preventive spray program for

446
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,080
twenty eight years that was in place and

447
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,399
my my reach or might jump into

448
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,670
beneficial insects was the

449
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,129
ineffectiveness of sprays it was worker

450
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:52,559
safety that I was concerned about it was

451
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,240
managing people around sprays and not

452
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,519
growing plants anymore

453
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,700
so to kind of answer your question we

454
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:02,278
don't I guess I'd say education is first

455
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,950
I'm not here to try to talk somebody

456
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,990
into using our product I try to give

457
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,790
them information on the benefits of

458
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,639
using our product you know the species

459
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:13,230
that we have and and what we can do for

460
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,360
you and with you and how that

461
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,680
transitions to you know health all

462
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,028
around whether it's you plant or you

463
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,189
know the consumers who use it on the

464
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:21,778
back end as well you know obviously you

465
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,029
know passed pesticide testing too so

466
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:25,289
that's a huge thing that is coming up in

467
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:27,240
the industry that's gonna be looked at

468
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:29,639
well if not coming up has been around

469
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,159
for a while that's continually looked at

470
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,838
on a daily basis so I always you know

471
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,370
taught nothing just me but my guys in

472
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,110
the office and I think I might have

473
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,179
chosen these words from you in the past

474
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,740
in conversation Shango that you know

475
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:43,379
it's even on our website it's choose

476
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,029
beneficial insects I tell my guys we're

477
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,580
not here to hard sell people we're here

478
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:49,409
to educate them first on what can be

479
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,240
used for their specific pest concerns

480
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:53,159
you know and then moving forward let's

481
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,539
hold their hand let any questions that

482
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,009
people have that come up you know

483
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:58,019
whether you've been using bio controls

484
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,759
for two years or ten I still get calls

485
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,169
from people that I set up a program four

486
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,588
years ago that have been a customer for

487
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:03,179
a while

488
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:06,120
that have a question that comes up you

489
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:08,879
know a lot of it is experience and I

490
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:12,389
think the biggest hurdle besides the

491
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,569
skepticism of it actually being an

492
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,949
effective pest management tool is is the

493
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,338
way that you kind of have to see to

494
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:19,679
believe

495
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:20,639
type thing like it actually works for

496
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,679
you you know what I mean

497
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,949
yeah well hit that party even harder

498
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,290
right give me an example or two of a big

499
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:30,240
trend a big commercial grow that has

500
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:32,099
made the transition because a lot of

501
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,289
folks they're just afraid of jumping

502
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,849
without a parachute or feeling like like

503
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:38,490
if they go if they start making the

504
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:40,829
transition and it doesn't work out that

505
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,750
they're gonna lose the whole crop like

506
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:44,129
give me a leave me a win success story

507
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,839
here so people can kind of picture

508
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,610
picture how it works at the

509
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,079
level during the second part of the show

510
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,849
we'll talk more about walking somebody

511
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,829
through the transition but just jump to

512
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:55,798
the end and give me an explanation of a

513
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:57,720
win well it's funny bring that up I mean

514
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,908
and and before the show I was as we were

515
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,740
speaking about a new hire of mine that I

516
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:04,110
have you know he was an indoor tier

517
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,240
three producer in Washington and I

518
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:08,969
didn't know this until he was actually

519
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,950
working in my office but I recall I

520
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,450
think it was December of last year when

521
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,548
I started working with his company and

522
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,069
he said Shane you know what can we do

523
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:19,980
for this here's our problems and I map

524
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:22,259
out controls that I usually want to tell

525
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,269
people if it was me this is how I would

526
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,648
approach it basically here's the species

527
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,929
to use here's what's gonna be aggressive

528
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:30,119
here's the days to order here's how much

529
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:32,130
to order basically this is what I think

530
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,479
is going to be effective for you and at

531
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,250
that stage he kind of took it and ran

532
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,079
with it calls me week later asked a

533
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,169
couple questions and within two months

534
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:42,000
he had a full transformation of you know

535
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,770
when I say chemicals I use that term

536
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,778
loosely as just sprays but they were

537
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:47,579
using Omri listed organic spray as

538
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:49,200
basically a lot of the times are

539
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:52,048
oil-based which are you know immediate

540
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,130
gratification it dissipates quickly but

541
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,408
within a couple months we had fully

542
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,850
transformed him over fast forward into I

543
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:59,340
just hired him two months ago to

544
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:00,808
represent me in Washington State and and

545
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,148
he's like you know when I called you a

546
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:05,730
year ago basically he goes I had to I

547
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:07,528
had to give my owner a guarantee that

548
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,690
your product was gonna work he goes you

549
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:11,190
never guaranteed that your product

550
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,840
wasn't work you actually told me this

551
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,700
isn't a guarantee man you know what I

552
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:16,678
mean this is this is what I think is

553
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,360
gonna be helpful again here's here's

554
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,490
what what I would use and what we would

555
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,259
do and he ran with it from there so

556
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,210
again in our previous conversation it

557
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,308
seems like a company needs to have that

558
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,960
guy there that is really interested in

559
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:30,538
doing it if there's an owner that's

560
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,220
pushing his head grower to do something

561
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:33,509
else that that is out of their comfort

562
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,610
level then sometimes it's really

563
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:37,408
difficult so I try to lay things out up

564
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:39,240
front towards people on where their

565
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,159
roadblocks may come in at where we might

566
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,720
have problems because I don't want to

567
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,270
make it guaranty and again it starts out

568
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,759
with education so I think that's an easy

569
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,990
story to tell as this guy tells me how

570
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,750
he works for me I was like yeah I

571
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,130
basically told the owner that I was

572
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,079
gonna guarantee that this is going to

573
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,669
work and he goes basically crossing

574
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,210
fingers everything worked out real well

575
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,590
and it's no issues at this point so

576
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,090
you know that was that was a great

577
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:04,099
success story in my head after hearing

578
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:05,899
from him we kind of went behind my back

579
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:07,759
and made the guarantee on his own to his

580
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,610
owner not for me basically yeah yeah I

581
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:13,759
get that and there's there's so many

582
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:16,549
variables to it and and you really do

583
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,200
need somebody on the inside who's going

584
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,839
to be dedicated to learning a little bit

585
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,490
about it and and paying attention to it

586
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:27,230
because it's you know while it is a a

587
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,210
comprehensive solution and works really

588
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,009
effectively it's not like a real simple

589
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,470
plug-and-play it isn't like a set it and

590
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:36,349
forget it kind of thing you like you

591
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,329
know most solutions for for a big guard

592
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:40,129
and you have to you have to massage it

593
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:41,720
let's go ahead and take our first short

594
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,280
break and be right back you're listening

595
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,440
to shaping fire and my guest today is

596
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,960
Shane Young founder of natural enemies

597
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,279
biocontrol

598
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,960
as a listener of shaping fire you

599
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,359
already understand the importance of

600
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,250
living soil when growing cannabis when

601
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,439
you have active microbe communities in

602
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,480
your substrate you go way beyond simply

603
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,210
fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and

604
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,220
potassium having active microorganisms

605
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,049
in your substrate supports vigorous

606
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,789
plant growth throughout the plants root

607
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:10,669
zone making for higher yields and

608
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:12,829
thriving flowers mammoth pea is the

609
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,990
first organically derived microbial

610
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:17,329
inoculant that focuses on your plants

611
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,370
nutrient cycling processes to release

612
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:21,259
soil phosphorus and other micronutrients

613
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:24,109
from they're bound forms making them

614
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:25,609
more available to the plant increased

615
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:27,379
levels of phosphorus will also keep

616
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:29,929
inner nodes shorter and focus your

617
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,120
plants energy on bud production not only

618
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,769
that but the microbes act as a defense

619
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,809
shield for the plants rhizosphere

620
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:38,480
by out competing potentially harmful

621
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:40,220
pathogenic microbes pretty cool right

622
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,349
mammoth pee not only unlocks the

623
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,259
nutrients in your soil but it also helps

624
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:47,240
protect your plant from disease mammoth

625
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:50,480
Peas beneficial bacteria act like

626
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,420
microbial reactors continually producing

627
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,250
enzymes that release nutrients mammoth

628
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,350
pee was developed at a u.s. university

629
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,210
has been extensively tested by Colorado

630
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:01,789
growers and independent laboratories

631
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,490
mammoth pee is proven to increase growth

632
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:05,659
and enhance blooming one of the great

633
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,370
things about supplementing with

634
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,050
microorganisms is that they won't

635
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:11,569
compete with whatever fertilizer program

636
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,589
you're already running simply dose on

637
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,109

deprivation solutions into your

643
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:50,450
greenhouse you can often add two or

644
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,519
three additional growing cycles to your

645
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,048
year when you pencil out the financial

646
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,179
benefit of those additional cycles

647
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:58,308
you'll realize why commercial scale

648
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:00,860
light deprivation technology is remaking

649
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:02,569
the cannabis industry what used to be

650
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:04,339
done by pulling tarps over hoop houses

651
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:05,750
has been scaled up over the last few

652
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:08,148
years in such a way that it's become

653
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,470
mechanized easy and affordable to even

654
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:12,739

experts have been in the fields of

661
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:24,950
Northern California for decades and

662
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,480
they're now building greenhouses for

663
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:29,450
commercial cannabis companies across the

664
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,190
country if you are new to light dep and

665
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,440
growing in greenhouses i encourage you

666
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,419
to go back to shaping fire episode 13

667

with guest eric Branstad of forever

668
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:39,140
flowering I talked with Eric about the

669
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,940
importance of intelligent greenhouse

670
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,950
management as well as the huge financial

671
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,679
benefit of incorporating light depth

672
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,419
techniques there are so many aspects of

673
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,730
utilizing a greenhouse that can go wrong

674
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:51,799
from temperature and airflow to light

675
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,630
depth and workflow forever flowering

676
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,028

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:25,190
work with go to shaping feiyr.com /f FG

691
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,940
to find out more welcome back you are

692
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,919
listening to Shay

693
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,360
in fire I'm your host Shango Louis and

694
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,629
our guest this week is Shane young

695
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,849
founder of natural enemies biocontrol so

696
00:24:32,628 --> 00:24:37,849
during the first set of the show we

697
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:40,069
talked about the approach to beneficial

698
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:41,658
insects and what they are and and why

699
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:43,849
they can be a great teammate for

700
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:46,399
defending your garden so so now we've

701
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:48,288
kind of given everybody an idea of what

702
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:51,109
beneficial insects are about let's talk

703
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:54,200
about thinking through the story problem

704
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:57,558
of introducing beneficial insects to a

705
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,929
garden when you go and you meet with a

706
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:02,028
new client I'm sure that you walk them

707
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:04,190
through a first couple steps so you can

708
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:06,950
figure out whether or not the garden is

709
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,048
is in an inappropriate target for

710
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,940
beneficial insects and to kind of think

711
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:12,710
through what the transition will even

712
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,298
look like will you walk all of us

713
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,909
through that so that people can consider

714
00:25:14,298 --> 00:25:19,759
it for their own gardens sure and you

715
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:21,620
know most Gardens are a proponent or it

716
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,079
can be used with beneficial insects a

717
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:25,758
lot of it has to do with people's pest

718
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,428
issues and as we spoke about there

719
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,149
specific species that go after certain

720
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:34,100
pests but you know it seems like

721
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:36,018
companies that culture or their culture

722
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,609
beneficial insects they've been around

723
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:40,250
for thirty plus years you know it isn't

724
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:42,528
anything new again it's a matter of

725
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,470
Education I'm showing a customer what

726
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:47,898
can be used and it's not just what that

727
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,120
we run into but we also pride ourselves

728
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:51,678
on giving people the why you know what I

729
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:53,928
mean I don't want people to come to us

730
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,778
and be like tell me what to do give them

731
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:57,889
something to do and they don't take any

732
00:25:55,778 --> 00:25:58,788
you know if they don't take any steps on

733
00:25:57,888 --> 00:26:00,740
their own to make sure it's working

734
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:02,778
right but we want to provide them what

735
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,359
to do we want to provide them why to do

736
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:08,089
it and then we leave a lot of work on

737
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,558
them as well because because it's not

738
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:10,970
like what you said earlier it's not like

739
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:13,038
you said it and forget about it

740
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,629
you know sprays isn't that way either

741
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,548
there's a lot of monitoring that goes

742
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:18,109
into it so you know new walk into a

743
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:21,950
facility it's that you know obviously

744
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:23,658
introductions its pest concerns its you

745
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,569
know where do we start and what do we do

746
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:28,309
and my biggest thing with people is or

747
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:30,079
with companies is obviously you know we

748
00:26:28,308 --> 00:26:31,878
want to start with your mother plants we

749
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,500
want to start with your veg we don't

750
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:35,449
want to we don't want to start at the

751
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,190
very end where you're having spider mite

752
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,288
problems that you know seven weeks in

753
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,710
the flower and you know what do I do at

754
00:26:39,288 --> 00:26:41,509
this

755
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,819
and I kind of leave them on their own

756
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:45,470
for that to figure out but you know we

757
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:46,579
can be helpful as well it depends on

758
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,038
what state they're in and what they can

759
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:51,500
and can't use basically so walking into

760
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,898
a facility it's again just gathering

761
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,640
information its fact-finding to see what

762
00:26:53,898 --> 00:26:57,769
their production is like see what their

763
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,299
protocol is see what they've been doing

764
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:01,730
in the past and you know why they're

765
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:05,509
coming to us to really formulate a plan

766
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:07,339
to be helpful to these people and you

767
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:09,710
know I talked about what sprays they've

768
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:10,970
used in the past there's some chemicals

769
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,980
that can be used that will actually

770
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,558
deter predatory mites from even coming

771
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,870
in helping so it's up for an information

772
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:19,849
it's when to use it how to use it

773
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:22,028
properly and where to begin

774
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:24,319
I generally try to talk people into

775
00:27:22,028 --> 00:27:25,849
regardless of how big a company is you

776
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,189
know you obviously want to jump in right

777
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,839
away and take care of all their rooms

778
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,090
you know that they have problems with or

779
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,220
interested in but we actually try to

780
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:35,928
start with people in their mother rooms

781
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,509
and if they're sharing that with a vege

782
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:40,730
as well because if you start out clean

783
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:42,829
and your plant is healthy and you push

784
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,778
that into flour you know chances are

785
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,629
there shouldn't be too many issues going

786
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:49,250
into the last flowering stages there you

787
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,899
need to have somebody that is again

788
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,329
interested in doing this you want

789
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:55,250
somebody to take responsibility you want

790
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:56,869
people to scout and monitor and tell us

791
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,190
what they're seeing so that you know we

792
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:59,808
can make our comments on what they're

793
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,970
seeing and why that is basically it's

794
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:03,470
not always the what it's always the why

795
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,149
you know why they're seeing this

796
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,429
basically it's being informational to

797
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:08,989
people it's interesting because what

798
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:11,769
you're describing is a balance right

799
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,890
it's a you you want to continually

800
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:15,679
course-correct

801
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:18,559
as you go so that you can keep this this

802
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,778
balance where where the plants are

803
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,839
healthy and the beneficial insects are

804
00:28:20,778 --> 00:28:26,450
able to do their job and and just keep

805
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,548
the population of the pests as low as

806
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,769
possible I'm assuming that it never goes

807
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:33,500
to zero it's about keeping them in

808
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:35,148
control know you touched on it and we

809
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,710
have different types of customers and we

810
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:39,439
have customers who want zero tolerance

811
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:43,399
and where I came from zero tolerance was

812
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,350
not feasible but I kind of disagree with

813
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:48,619
that if you pay enough and you use

814
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:50,209
enough species and predators a specific

815
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:51,709
amount of time you're not gonna have any

816
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,769
issues we have a lot of companies that

817
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,140
you know

818
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:57,180
rather than using the scouting and

819
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,180
monitoring technique they would rather

820
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,130
pay more upfront with us to have the

821
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,110
specific program in place where they

822
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,120
don't have to worry about it and that

823
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,589
concerns me because regardless of how

824
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,839
much you put in there could always be

825
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:11,159
something else that may come up you know

826
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,659
if you're using the species that's

827
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,920
specific for thrips you know maybe

828
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,120
you're getting spider mites or vice

829
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,080
versa

830
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,579
so it's real difficult I'm sorry it's

831
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:23,129
not difficult people just have different

832
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:24,720
ways of approaching pest management but

833
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,160
when you do have a small pest population

834
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,779
if I tell people I'm smiling right now

835
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,220
Shengo it's like it's a pest

836
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,500
it's called pest management for a reason

837
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,240
you know what I mean it's monitoring you

838
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,769
know populations of good versus the bad

839
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,660
and you know do I need to make a

840
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:38,400
decision and what product do I use is it

841
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,290
slow release a che or is it active

842
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,330
adults you know to help clean up my area

843
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:44,159
quickly so again that's where we come in

844
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:45,509
to be helpful as people sure that makes

845
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,790
a lot of sense and I and I've heard

846
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:50,069
people poopoo beneficial insects about

847
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:51,690
how they're not a hundred percent and my

848
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:53,879
thought is you know the people that I

849
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,500
know who spray enough to feel like

850
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,600
they're at a hundred percent they're

851
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,700
putting themselves at risk with other

852
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,309
plant problems because they're spraying

853
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,930
so much you know especially if they you

854
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,639
know if they're if they're spraying oils

855
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,470
and they're moving towards bloom you

856
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,090
know you use this example that I found

857
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:11,490
very interesting you said you know you

858
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:13,349
want to start with the mother so you get

859
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:16,380
them early because you don't want to end

860
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:20,219
up in week seven of bloom with with

861
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,590
spider mites and so what if you do find

862
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,589
yourself at week seven with spider mites

863
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:30,179
can beneficial insects be used for a

864
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:33,119
like an acute hot problem now in bloom

865
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,190
like like Edda at the end or is it is it

866
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,079
too late at that point for beneficial

867
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:40,370
insects to have helped and you you

868
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:43,259
really have to start early in your cycle

869
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:44,939
so one thing to comment on well is when

870
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:46,710
you say people poopoo you know

871
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,509
beneficial insects you know that's why I

872
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,460
got into it because my spray program

873
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:51,599
wasn't as effective as I thought it was

874
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,309
you know I mean so there's there's

875
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,509
there's two sides of the story obviously

876
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,759
you can spray and still have problems

877
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:58,140
you can use beneficial insects and still

878
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,490
have problems with it you know I just

879
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,720
want to comment on that off the bat

880
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,880
that's what transition to me on

881
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,920
beneficial use is because the spray

882
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,670
program I had put in place actually as I

883
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,170
got I just sprayed a couple days ago and

884
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,970
still have mites over here I'm like it

885
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,380
doesn't make sense so what's a better

886
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,839
way of dealing with things what's more

887
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,880
effective what's healthy you know to the

888
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,559
safety what's healthy and safety and

889
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,390
safe you know for employees that you

890
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:21,149
have is is looking for something out and

891
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,050
again it goes back to education on that

892
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,759
fast-forward to your next question on

893
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,409
you know what if you do find yourself in

894
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:28,569
bloom in week 7 your cropping out in 8

895
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,400
weeks you know it's difficult I'll be

896
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:32,079
forward with you it's difficult to take

897
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,430
care of a problem at that stage with

898
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:35,169
beneficial insects because you have a

899
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,840
very limited pool of what you can pull

900
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:40,570
to use that for a lot of the times the

901
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,159
predatory mites are they find it very

902
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:44,079
difficult to crawl across you know the

903
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,519
flower and the trichomes you know you if

904
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,279
you can imagine a tiny little insect

905
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,259
trying to climb across you know hairy

906
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,970
plants and then you and then you add the

907
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:53,950
stickiness of the flower into it it's an

908
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,870
unfriendly environment number one so

909
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,299
that comes before it gets to that stage

910
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:59,859
that's where the monitoring and scouting

911
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:01,629
comes in on you know if we have any

912
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:03,759
issues let's take care of it before it

913
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,860
really gets into this stage at that

914
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,379
point there's a couple products that we

915
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:10,059
do use that I call our fliers versus

916
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,220
predatory mites that are roaming around

917
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:14,500
the canopy of your plant that can be

918
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,079
helpful and again all honesty Shango I

919
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,130
tell people Mike you can use this

920
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,329
obviously there's no guarantees going

921
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,260
into it and it's going to cost you a lot

922
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:22,629
of money you know to clean up a

923
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:23,920
situation quickly because that you need

924
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,200
to understand that there's also a life

925
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,200
cycle of pests that you have and when

926
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,000
you introduce a beneficial insect or a

927
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,250
predatory bug I guess you would say it's

928
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,049
not like they sit there and eat all day

929
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,539
long until your pests are gone you know

930
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:40,089
they have a resting phase similar as we

931
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,349
do they need to rest then they need to

932
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:44,199
reproduce and be able to eat again I

933
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:46,569
mean so yeah I mean it is difficult at

934
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,190
that stage yes it can be done I tell

935
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:49,839
people you know physical removal might

936
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:52,059
be your best bet rather than buying

937
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,369
product from me why don't you use one of

938
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:56,500
your company employees you know you can

939
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:58,779
use a low powered vacuum cleaner you can

940
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,099
physically remove them with you know

941
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:01,779
paper cloth towels that are wet

942
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:03,009
basically and then people laugh at me

943
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,539
they're like you how many plants that we

944
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:06,009
have problems with and I said well you

945
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:07,899
know this could have been prevented

946
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:10,839
basically with different techniques

947
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,850
heading up to this item and yeah it does

948
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:14,740
so it sounds like so yeah if you have an

949
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:18,579
acute problem right before you harvest

950
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,210
yeah you can throw money and beneficials

951
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:23,158
at it

952
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:26,048
labor and do your best for it but really

953
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,809
you know you may want to just start with

954
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:30,548
your mother plants and and understand

955
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:33,308
that the the cycle you that you're in

956
00:33:30,548 --> 00:33:36,220
right now may not be as successful as

957
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:38,470
you want but start on the next sex cycle

958
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,000
and and be forward-looking you know you

959
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,259
said something else that I found really

960
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,450
interesting you know one of the reasons

961
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:46,148
why some people push against beneficials

962
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,909
is is because the trichomes are so

963
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:52,329
sticky and they're so effective at at

964
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:53,950
gumming up and grabbing insects that

965
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:57,038
people say to me you know why would I

966
00:33:53,950 --> 00:34:00,038
want to add more insects to my garden

967
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:04,390
because then my final product is going

968
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:07,119
to have more dead captured insects in

969
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,470
the trichomes so so when people when

970
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:13,088
people ask you about that what do you

971
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:14,799
say I try not to laughs number one well

972
00:34:13,088 --> 00:34:16,358
know that you know and again and I hate

973
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,190
to keep preaching the same words but

974
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:19,869
education becomes first you know what I

975
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,010
mean that's a you know a lot of times

976
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:22,599
like I said it's an unfriendly

977
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,609
environment for them were we physically

978
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,169
we've watched these things because the

979
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:28,088
natural searching of a predatory might

980
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:29,799
in general you know if it's on your

981
00:34:28,088 --> 00:34:32,108
plant or canopy is to go upwards

982
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,460
basically and I recall being in Portland

983
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:34,569
here one time and a guy called me as I

984
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,159
came and you know what we're doing is

985
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,330
not working and I want to make sure that

986
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,710
we're doing at the right stage and this

987
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:40,598
is when I started out four years ago in

988
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,579
cannabis and I remember walking over to

989
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:45,159
this place and and literally releasing

990
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:47,079
the species called per simulus excuse me

991
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,240
for two spots spider mite and instantly

992
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,500
I basically just watched it climb up the

993
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,388
stem and it gets to the flower and it

994
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,829
turns right back down and then it climbs

995
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:56,079
right back up and goes down up and down

996
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,279
up and down up and down and basically

997
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,199
it's gonna die of exhaustion a lot

998
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,839
quicker so when people are concerned

999
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,069
about species or predatory mites getting

1000
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,059
stuck in their flower for the most part

1001
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,849
they don't go there

1002
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:08,588
I guess you would say because it because

1003
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:11,019
it's difficult for them and it's really

1004
00:35:08,588 --> 00:35:13,449
hard for them to thrive and even move

1005
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:15,250
anywhere in that stage if I can recall

1006
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:17,289
in the last four years doing this of

1007
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,389
pictures of people sending predatory

1008
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:20,769
mites like pictures of their flower to

1009
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:22,900
me and they're like hey man this is

1010
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:24,280
stuck in it and you know what is it

1011
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,170
number one because there were new

1012
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,400
customers of mine and I'm like god that

1013
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,289
looks like a predatory mite and I've

1014
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,670
literally seen that picture one time I

1015
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:31,570
guess you'd say in four years where it's

1016
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,420
stuck on a flower

1017
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,220
the only other

1018
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,690
it wasn't a predatory mite it was

1019
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:39,149
actually a money pirate bug and it's

1020
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,009
called aureus and the aureus was stuck

1021
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,269
directly in the flower my customer

1022
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:43,858
pulled the aureus out and there was a

1023
00:35:42,268 --> 00:35:45,568
spider mite in ER that it was going

1024
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:48,328
after basically got kind of stuck in

1025
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:50,038
like a hole basically going after it the

1026
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:52,950
flower and I mean other than that

1027
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:55,650
there's I haven't received any responses

1028
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:58,048
from people that what you gave me is not

1029
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:00,650
working out because it's ending up in

1030
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:03,150
our flower to ending up in our buds that

1031
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:05,039
makes sense it may it kind of just

1032
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,579
suggests it's a it's a growing myth

1033
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:11,519
right that that yeah we've all seen you

1034
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:13,798
know bugs usually flying bugs in the

1035
00:36:11,518 --> 00:36:15,838
trichomes but you're saying yeah that's

1036
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:17,608
not the bugs that we're adding so just

1037
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,798
because you've seen bugs caught in your

1038
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,358
trichomes doesn't mean that these are

1039
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:22,858
the same beneficial insects that you're

1040
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,719
gonna use the defend your garden would

1041
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:25,889
that be a good way to say it yeah that's

1042
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,259
a good way to say it I mean things that

1043
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:29,699
you see that are flying I mean the first

1044
00:36:28,259 --> 00:36:31,108
thing that comes to mind is fungus gnats

1045
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:32,518
you know and people have an outbreak of

1046
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:33,989
fungus gnats that's one of the bigger

1047
00:36:32,518 --> 00:36:35,879
problems rather than them spreading

1048
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:37,229
disease through the routing system the

1049
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,940
adults that you have are more of a

1050
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,528
nuisance in traditional AG but in

1051
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,999
cannabis they get stuck to the flower so

1052
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:43,619
it's like it becomes a real pain in the

1053
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:46,139
ass for people to deal with and work

1054
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:48,778
around at that stage so you know a lot

1055
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:50,548
of the times what we offer to people as

1056
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:52,650
product as well we show them pictures of

1057
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:54,028
them images this is this is what it is

1058
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,139
because we don't want them to call us

1059
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:57,239
two weeks down the road we like god I

1060
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:58,379
got this I got this other pest basically

1061
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,449
and they'll send us pictures are like no

1062
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,798
these guys are on your side you know

1063
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:03,598
this was this is what we talked about

1064
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:06,838
two weeks ago these are your teammates

1065
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,880
killer of it yeah nice to those guys so

1066
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,119
you know again it's it we're trying to

1067
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,088
formulate as a company be as helpful as

1068
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,829
possible to people give them not as many

1069
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:18,268
options as possible really limited

1070
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:20,278
options on what we seem to be most

1071
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:21,328
effective in certain situations you know

1072
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:22,559
that was one of the most difficult

1073
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:24,660
things for me when I started out

1074
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:27,778
biocontrol is I felt like I learned a

1075
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:30,268
lot on my own but I had to go through so

1076
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:32,518
many resources a lot of people a lot of

1077
00:37:30,268 --> 00:37:34,219
time in order to formulate what I

1078
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:36,568
thought was best for a situation

1079
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:38,429
something could be different based off

1080
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:40,588
experience you know that you run into or

1081
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:42,210
other people so you know again our

1082
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:45,119
company is focused on being helpful to

1083
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,440
people offering them education on what

1084
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,240
to do and and what

1085
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,829
like this is what we found to be most

1086
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,509
effective you can get information from

1087
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:53,609
somebody else and it may be different

1088
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,960
and that's great if it's helpful and

1089
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:55,980
effective to you that's awesome

1090
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,838
we appreciate it you know what I mean

1091
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,460
but we just kind of speak from

1092
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,199
experiences grow or feedback and

1093
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,550
personal experiences through here yeah

1094
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:04,889
right on that's one hell of a sales

1095
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,050
cycle you know you you play this role of

1096
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:08,940
evangelists and you know these are more

1097
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,710
than customers they're actually you know

1098
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,599
getting a partnership with these people

1099
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,309
because it has to evolve over months and

1100
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,530
there's a lot of education back and

1101
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:17,759
forth yeah I totally get that so so

1102
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,519
let's get down some some more

1103
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,140
nitty-gritty so so once a grower has

1104
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:26,099
decided that they want to make the

1105
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:29,068
transition from spraying to using

1106
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:31,079
beneficial insects break it down for me

1107
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:33,389
what that looks like is it as simple as

1108
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:35,519
you know day one comes and the spraying

1109
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:38,868
is done and and that's the same day you

1110
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:42,420
release the beneficials or is there a

1111
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:45,480
clean up the plants period where the old

1112
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,338
pesticides have to you know volatilize

1113
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,389
and go away before you can add the

1114
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:54,150
beneficials so what we start to do with

1115
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:55,529
people is you know keeping or speaking

1116
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,660
about what's already been spoken for us

1117
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,030
you know sanitation plant health we talk

1118
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:01,889
about those things but what we also talk

1119
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,510
about and that's changed I feel in

1120
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:05,429
cannabis and again this is this is my

1121
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,470
thoughts on what's happening is and when

1122
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:09,239
I came from traditional agriculture my

1123
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:11,279
rates for beneficial insects were based

1124
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:12,779
off per acre whether it was ten twenty

1125
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,970
or thirty thousand predatory mites per

1126
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,220
acre this is the species that we've used

1127
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:18,989
this is for the reason on how they're

1128
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,489
gonna help you basically when I started

1129
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,259
recommended in cannabis it became

1130
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:23,759
difficult because that wasn't working

1131
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,800
very well for me and I had to make

1132
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,210
changes at that point you know again

1133
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,680
number one is not starting with your

1134
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,269
flower plants it's starting from the

1135
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:33,809
very beginning you know what that does

1136
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:35,969
it eliminates a lot of cost with people

1137
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:38,400
it gives them a chance to work with

1138
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:40,469
things slowly and see it as it walks

1139
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,599
through from you know mother plants to

1140
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:43,949
their cuttings to veg before it gets

1141
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,410
into flower it gives you three or four

1142
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:48,328
weeks to kind of have that education and

1143
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:50,519
balance and information on you know what

1144
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:53,220
to use and how to use it when you talk

1145
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,559
about pesticide use it's difficult to

1146
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:57,929
nail down like specific you know do this

1147
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,849
one two three basically but what we do

1148
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:01,230
with people is we ask them again

1149
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:03,150
you know what your procedures been like

1150
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,710
in the past what's your pest concerns

1151
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,300
basically what's your pest level at this

1152
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,829
point you know and if they can't answer

1153
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,870
some of these reasons you can only give

1154
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:11,730
them a broad answer I guess you would

1155
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:13,409
say does the whole does that whole grow

1156
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,090
have to be sprayed down and clean

1157
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:16,679
because I'm assuming that you know if

1158
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,960
they're spraying residual there'll be

1159
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:21,569
residual pesticides on surfaces and

1160
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,970
those would injure the newly introduced

1161
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:26,010
beneficial insects right I want to

1162
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:29,939
encourage people to spray everything

1163
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:33,180
down to clean things up I I personally

1164
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,800
think that has been used differently by

1165
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:37,019
each company you work with each person

1166
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,910
that you may work with at this stage I

1167
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:43,949
prefer to I prefer to have there be a

1168
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:45,599
pest level of some stage so that there's

1169
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:46,980
a food source for the predatory mites to

1170
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,409
start working against depend on what

1171
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,269
your pest is rather than spraying

1172
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:53,039
something down to clean it up I mean yes

1173
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:54,869
you can't approach it that way as well

1174
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,250
but then you need to wait X amount of

1175
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,319
days depend on the product that you use

1176
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,630
because there are residuals that are

1177
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:04,400
left over but again you know what's nice

1178
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:06,480
is seen what states are allowing

1179
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,519
cultivators to use at this stage because

1180
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,440
a lot of it is oil-based which

1181
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,119
dissipates quickly which doesn't leave a

1182
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,440
whole lot of residues you know what I

1183
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,349
used to do about eight years ago

1184
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,179
starting to use it as I ran trials on

1185
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:19,799
what I sprayed and then and then spray

1186
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:21,839
my plants with water just for hydration

1187
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,030
you know what I mean that helps helps

1188
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,860
wash residuals off so maybe you can you

1189
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,940
know take that from seven days down to

1190
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,910
five days where we can apply the

1191
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,650
beneficial insects specific products

1192
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:33,269
it's kind of what it's all about Shango

1193
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,130
because there are things that you can

1194
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:36,869
spray a day before and then release

1195
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,510
beneficial insects you know the next day

1196
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:41,250
or two days later it may not be an

1197
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,050
insecticide per se may be a bio

1198
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,840
insecticide which are a lot of active

1199
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,880
fungus is that people can use that do

1200
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,460
not leave residuals that don't have any

1201
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,789
you know re-entry hours after you spray

1202
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:55,349
them or it's limited to like four hours

1203
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:57,389
so it really depends on what they've

1204
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,469
been doing prior you know and kind of

1205
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,460
where their focus is on where they want

1206
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:00,539
to go and if they really want to try

1207
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,579
this thing you know if they really want

1208
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:04,289
to walk the walk then you know we asked

1209
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,759
very specific questions before we start

1210
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:08,279
working with somebody the most difficult

1211
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,630
thing is when people call in say hey can

1212
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,370
you send me some predatory mites I'm

1213
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,260
like yeah we can you know help me out

1214
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:13,529
here so what happened about three years

1215
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,450
ago

1216
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,940
we started creating what I call a new

1217
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:20,569
customer inquiry which people can fill

1218
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:23,220
out online and that basically gives us

1219
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,200
90% of the information that we need to

1220
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:26,819
be helpful with you and to show you how

1221
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,589
to walk from step one to step two to

1222
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,590
step three you know if you're using if

1223
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,090
you're using Avid or orthene or using

1224
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,250
something like this residuals maybe

1225
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:37,289
longer than if you're a man I just use

1226
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,550
you know I just use a botanic garden my

1227
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:40,289
product which is an active fungus you

1228
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,550
know it's it's we could probably start

1229
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:44,009
the very next day or two days later

1230
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:46,890
United means so the new customer inquiry

1231
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:48,360
really gives us information needed to be

1232
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:49,889
helpful to people and when they can

1233
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,630
start what they can use and kind of what

1234
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:53,940
to expect moving forward in a program

1235
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:56,190
yeah right on and you know as we've gone

1236
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,700
on I know that it pains you to go back

1237
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:01,260
again and again to the idea of the

1238
00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:03,000
education aspect and that's how primary

1239
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,850
that is but but the more you talk the

1240
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,449
more I get it that that each grow really

1241
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:11,900
is its own environment and the what

1242
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:14,159
they're spraying is a variable and and

1243
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,849
there's just so many variables that is

1244
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:21,329
not one solution fits for everybody and

1245
00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:23,489
and so really it's about getting in and

1246
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:25,259
and and participating with them to

1247
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:27,389
figure out what their problem you know

1248
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,790
program is going to be and then and then

1249
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:31,469
and then and doing the transition so so

1250
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:33,889
I want to talk more about the the

1251
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:35,759
transition and especially about

1252
00:43:33,889 --> 00:43:37,379
application rates but we need to take

1253
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,730
our second break so we're gonna take

1254
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,349
that break and rate be right back

1255
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:42,300
you're listening to shaping fire and my

1256
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:44,420
guest today is Shane Young founder of

1257
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,070
natural enemies biocontrol

1258
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,960
as cannabis normalization sweeps the

1259
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,850
country knowledge of how to grow

1260
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,650
cannabis naturally and without synthetic

1261
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:55,889
inputs has become more and more

1262
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:57,660
available in fact probiotic growers are

1263
00:43:55,889 --> 00:43:59,940
experiencing large yields and

1264
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:01,849
exceptional terpene profiles without

1265
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:04,710
using chemicals banned in their state

1266
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:07,650
move away from the risks inherent to

1267
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:10,650
chemical nutrients and instead invest in

1268
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:13,170

00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,559
healthy thriving cannabis now that the

1290
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,670
health benefits of terpenes have become

1291
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,799
well known in the cannabis industry

1292
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,950
people everywhere are looking for the

1293
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,960
purest terpenes without adulterants the

1294
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:18,639
problem with most terpene providers is

1295
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,409
that they're not sourced naturally and

1296
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,799
instead are made as a byproduct of

1297
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:26,079
refining petroleum and that's so sketchy

1298
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,240
the terpenes sold by true terpenes are

1299
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,029
entirely different they are certified

1300
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,739
organic non-gmo and food grade that

1301
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:35,290
means they are extracted from real plant

1302
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:37,000
sources there are no solvents of any

1303
00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:39,519
kind used during the extraction process

1304
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
they are distilled only with steam

1305
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:44,860
that's right only steam in fact terpenes

1306
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,019
from true terpenes are so pure that you

1307
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:49,539
can eat them not only that but you can

1308
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:50,019
stack them with better results - what I

1309
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:52,210
mean is

1310
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:54,309
other companies terpenes have got a few

1311
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:56,230
percent of impurities and when you stack

1312
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:57,759
those terpenes to make a blend you're

1313
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,610
adding a variety of impurities that

1314
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,520
degrade your final product true terpenes

1315
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:05,170
also has strain-specific terpenes for a

1316
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,210
wide range of cannabis strains like

1317
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,789
Durbin poison sunset sherbet and

1318
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,800
granddaddy purple true terpenes has

1319

1341
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:02,018
are listening to shaping fire I'm your

1342
00:47:00,429 --> 00:47:04,268
host Shango Lowe's and our guest this

1343
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:05,229
week is Shane young founder of natural

1344
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:07,088
enemies biocontrol

1345
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:09,309
so in this last section I want to talk

1346
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:11,558
about what it's actually like to do the

1347
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:13,960
application process how do you go about

1348
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:16,930
applying the beneficial insects to the

1349
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:20,170
plants that's a great question because

1350
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:22,419
the problem that people or growers have

1351
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,759
been seeing is that you know information

1352
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,769
on the packaging on the leader

1353
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:29,219
containers or whatever you're using for

1354
00:47:26,768 --> 00:47:31,568
application you know some of them say

1355
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:33,338
spread these all over your flower and

1356
00:47:31,568 --> 00:47:34,690
that's you know that that's not what you

1357
00:47:33,338 --> 00:47:36,308
want to do in cannabis at this stage

1358
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,139
because you're gonna be spending a lot

1359
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:40,089
of time trying to clean that up if you

1360
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:43,210
can eventually clean it all up basically

1361
00:47:40,088 --> 00:47:45,699
so that's very difficult for people to

1362
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:47,829
do it so again it comes with you know an

1363
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:49,689
initial conversation possibly people

1364
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:50,950
reaching out on how do I apply this but

1365
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,749
for the most part we try to write it out

1366
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:54,969
for people we try to make things simple

1367
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:57,669
on you know obviously the label is going

1368
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:59,259
to say this I'm sorry to say you're not

1369
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:01,450
gonna follow that you can't do that

1370
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:02,739
that's not the way of doing it so it's

1371
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:04,239
difficult it could come up in

1372
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:06,519
conversation it can come up by email

1373
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,199
whatever it may be can you give an

1374
00:48:06,518 --> 00:48:10,659
example can you get real specific there

1375
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:13,778
Shane what kind of application example

1376
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:16,838
would you see on the labels that that

1377
00:48:13,778 --> 00:48:18,369
that you would educate somebody through

1378
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:20,380
like I try to make sure that the

1379
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:22,690
listeners have got you know real

1380
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:25,509
actionable results so give us an example

1381
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:28,690
of why cannabis is different from the

1382
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:31,420
other crops that that they're beneficial

1383
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:32,980
insect may be labeled for sure no just

1384
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:34,838
when I touched on again one of the label

1385
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,989
says to spread the product over your

1386
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:39,849
flower and it could be my first thought

1387
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:43,119
right now is that specifically for a

1388
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:46,150
thrips predator whether using Swirsky or

1389
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,470
cuca marisa of species for it you know

1390
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,579
because they want to say to spread it

1391
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:50,469
across the flower because that's

1392
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:52,509
generally where the thrips are going to

1393
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,828
congregate basically so one thing that

1394
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:55,989
you could do is i

1395
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:59,140
feel it's an old method of control but

1396
00:48:55,989 --> 00:49:01,420
still an effective method is you can use

1397
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:03,400
it to apply to the base or the stock of

1398
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,108
your plant basically you can create

1399
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,420
piles towards the stem where they'll

1400
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:09,818
crawl up and your plant that way a

1401
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,709
secondary way that you can do it is is

1402
00:49:09,818 --> 00:49:14,079
what we call in the office we call them

1403
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:16,058
hanging baskets and what's funny is I

1404
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,440
used to I used to try to figure out a

1405
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:19,359
more effective way of application for

1406
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,159
product as well a long time ago so I

1407
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:22,838
actually used to buy like Dixie Cups or

1408
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:25,868
Solo cups and I would poke holes in them

1409
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:27,099
and use like not wire hangers but like

1410
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:29,229
ornament hangers to hang out of my

1411
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:31,450
plants and I would dump product into

1412
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:33,068
these cups and then I would hang them on

1413
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:35,498
the plant because the active adults are

1414
00:49:33,068 --> 00:49:37,989
gonna crawl up the plant up the cup into

1415
00:49:35,498 --> 00:49:40,568
your plant basically and then just years

1416
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:42,400
ago biocontrol companies started

1417
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:44,409
creating what they call hanging baskets

1418
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,450
where they're already pre-made for you

1419
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:48,129
to do an application for so what's

1420
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:49,899
difficult is when somebody's like yeah I

1421
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,709
follow the directions and this is what

1422
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,119
happened

1423
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:55,149
sometimes you can't give that

1424
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:56,318
information out you know on the on the

1425
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,528
application so we actually try to

1426
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:01,329
provide like an application sheet for

1427
00:49:59,528 --> 00:50:02,889
specific species when we work with

1428
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:04,239
people as well so that you know when

1429
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:05,739
they're choosing to do something again

1430
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,509
we want them to be effective so we want

1431
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:08,559
to give them the most information to be

1432
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:10,539
effective which is how to do the

1433
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,430
application at that stage so that that's

1434
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:13,180
really what comes to mind of mice on my

1435
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:15,608
site when Yasir

1436
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:18,639
does the choice between using say for

1437
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:21,058
example a hanging basket or a sachet do

1438
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:24,670
those different application techniques

1439
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:26,829
depend on the the type of beneficial

1440
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,630
that you're adding or the size of the

1441
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:31,329
garden or just simply the preference of

1442
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:33,039
the grower it actually touches on a lot

1443
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:35,229
of different things preference of the

1444
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:37,778
grower yes there's a couple different

1445
00:50:35,228 --> 00:50:38,858
ways of doing an application you know

1446
00:50:37,778 --> 00:50:40,809
there's one thing called the slow

1447
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:42,458
release sachet which is an actual

1448
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:44,140
breeding bag is what I call it that

1449
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:45,879
slowly release predatory mites into the

1450
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:47,379
canopy of your plant and when I stress

1451
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,699
to people as these are truly used as a

1452
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,469
preventative maintenance unit I mean

1453
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:52,209
because if you have a problem you want

1454
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:53,409
to use active adults if you have a

1455
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:55,629
problem if you have a pest issue you

1456
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:57,368
don't want to use slow-release ashes on

1457
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:59,108
that plant yes it will be helpful in the

1458
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:01,119
long run so you can do the sachets and

1459
00:50:59,108 --> 00:51:03,489
the adults in the same application

1460
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,690
basically that gives you more immediate

1461
00:51:03,489 --> 00:51:06,489
control and then it gives you

1462
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:06,929
long-lasting control of the sachet that

1463
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:09,240
you've already

1464
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:11,460
applied to it different species are

1465
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:13,439
available in different different forms

1466
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,929
of application for the most part that

1467
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,579
come in slow-release ashes they come in

1468
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:19,379
active adults which at which I call you

1469
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:21,930
know the bulk leader containers or five

1470
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:24,240
liter bags can be used for commercial

1471
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:26,250
growers that use more product

1472
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,889
you know there's Flyers that can just be

1473
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,599
released that fly you know that can kind

1474
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:32,368
of encompass your growing space on their

1475
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:33,990
own where you don't have to apply them

1476
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:36,539
to every single plant or every third

1477
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:39,149
plant by any means so it just depends on

1478
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:42,389
the predator that you use I know that a

1479
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:45,088
lot of the the breeders of these

1480
00:51:42,389 --> 00:51:47,848
beneficial insects they sell them with

1481
00:51:45,088 --> 00:51:50,460
application rates that were devised for

1482
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:53,730
ornamental plants and cannabis is a very

1483
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:56,460
unique lady what we know what have you

1484
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:59,789
seen as far as a you know any difference

1485
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:02,818
in application rates for cannabis versus

1486
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:05,849
you know boring industry standard plants

1487
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:07,710
yeah it's a it's a great question and

1488
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:09,630
it's I don't say unfortunate that I

1489
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:12,420
can't change my information online

1490
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:14,338
because I get that information direct

1491
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,380
from the suppliers who actually culture

1492
00:52:14,338 --> 00:52:17,639
the product you know and I mean but when

1493
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,588
you touch on it when I started

1494
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:21,328
recommending in cannabis agricultural

1495
00:52:19,588 --> 00:52:23,068
rates I would calculate out by square

1496
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:24,619
footage you know what I mean it's kind

1497
00:52:23,068 --> 00:52:26,429
of what I used to do per acre basically

1498
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:28,470
calculated out in square footage what

1499
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:31,259
can be used and I just remember selling

1500
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:33,419
my first liter of soil mites for fungus

1501
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,680
net control and God the guy I don't know

1502
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,059
how many plants and is you know a

1503
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:38,068
thousand square front room and I'm like

1504
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:39,809
yeah you know what one liter of soil

1505
00:52:38,068 --> 00:52:41,068
mites per 1000 square feet you know

1506
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:41,700
that's the rate of use for the last

1507
00:52:41,068 --> 00:52:43,588
eight years

1508
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:45,629
doctor [ __ ] out of your fungus gnats and

1509
00:52:43,588 --> 00:52:48,298
again you know two weeks later he's like

1510
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:50,220
no it's not working and that's when I

1511
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:51,750
got into well why isn't it working you

1512
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:53,608
know what I mean and the amount of water

1513
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,230
that's being applied to the plant cuz

1514
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:56,969
not not just for the hell of it you know

1515
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:59,309
it's because it demands it so much it

1516
00:52:56,969 --> 00:53:02,129
grows like a weed it it needs that water

1517
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:04,530
and basically for for growth at that

1518
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:07,890
stage so just starting from that small

1519
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:10,109
arena of more soil mites more often we

1520
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:12,210
had to get some in every single pot so I

1521
00:53:10,108 --> 00:53:13,619
ran trials for I don't know if it was

1522
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,329
four months or so you know offering

1523
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:17,818
product splitting product with people

1524
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:18,550
who were interested in using it on kind

1525
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:20,259
of formulated

1526
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:21,850
plan for them moving forward on how to

1527
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,200
be effective using this product and is

1528
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:24,849
it going to be cost effective on our end

1529
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,980
you know but when you talk about cost

1530
00:53:24,849 --> 00:53:28,599
effectiveness you take out labor of

1531
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,670
sprained you take out the health of the

1532
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:33,069
plant basically you take out any chance

1533
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:36,369
of getting knocked for a pesticide test

1534
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,750
all these different things so I guess

1535
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:39,369
looking over it and talking to the guys

1536
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:42,309
in the office here that we deal with

1537
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:45,130
there's a very few growers that we have

1538
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:47,320
that use traditional AG rates and are

1539
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:49,420
very effective with it there's very few

1540
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,670
and far between so for the most part you

1541
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:53,889
can times the rates by five just to give

1542
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:55,150
you a generalization but it also depends

1543
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:57,339
on what you're doing on the back end you

1544
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:59,079
know you made the comment about hit it

1545
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,820
you know or apply it and leave it you

1546
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:02,590
know earlier on in the conversation and

1547
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,330
you know you can't do that with anything

1548
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:05,710
you can't do that if you have a spray

1549
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:08,110
program because you still need to

1550
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:10,210
monitor there still may be a pest issue

1551
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:11,590
or a pest present at that stage where if

1552
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:13,720
you don't take care of it right away

1553
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:16,809
it's going to you know quickly become

1554
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:18,039
larger and larger as you move on so you

1555
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:19,779
know I hope that it kind of it kind of

1556
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:22,150
helps answer the question that you were

1557
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:24,880
looking for yeah yeah it does so do you

1558
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:27,130
find that based on bioregions for

1559
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,019
example where where the plants are being

1560
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:32,079
grown in the u.s. that you either need

1561
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:34,599
to choose different beneficial insects

1562
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,279
or the application rate changes because

1563
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:38,860
I assume that if you're doing

1564
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,600
applications you know in in the cold

1565
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:43,930
northwest it's gonna be a lot different

1566
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:45,190
in the hella hot Arizona yeah no a great

1567
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:47,409
question and a lot of it has to do with

1568
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:49,090
one you know choosing the correct

1569
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:51,789
species for the pests that you're after

1570
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:54,730
you know number two it does have to do

1571
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:56,500
with the heat and also the humidity of a

1572
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:58,599
region where you're at you know a lot of

1573
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,849
times lower humidities are gonna dry out

1574
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:02,889
the eggs of the predatory mites which

1575
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:04,869
causes problems or which delays

1576
00:55:02,889 --> 00:55:06,699
reproduction basically it takes longer

1577
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:08,440
to do that so you know I've been

1578
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:09,939
approached by a lot of people who you

1579
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,220
know they're running ten fifteen percent

1580
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:14,170
humidity throughout the summer and my

1581
00:55:12,219 --> 00:55:16,599
comment is no these these are not

1582
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:18,970
documented to do that we may need to do

1583
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:20,889
again applications more often to be

1584
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:22,719
effective we may switch it up rather

1585
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:24,609
than using these sachets which are

1586
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,769
probably going to release slowly in your

1587
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,360
crop and not a little bit quickly more

1588
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:30,159
quickly at a place that has 50 percent

1589
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,200
humidity or 60 you know what I mean

1590
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,269
which is fairly ideal for Reaper

1591
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:35,949
action and I just go into again I'll

1592
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:37,269
honestly I'm like hey man this was three

1593
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:39,608
years ago at a guy that's like hey your

1594
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:41,500
session is lasted five five weeks we had

1595
00:55:39,608 --> 00:55:43,328
12 percent humidity for three months I'm

1596
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,309
like I don't understand how that was

1597
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:46,869
possible but showing them how to open

1598
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:48,400
the packages up looking to see if

1599
00:55:46,869 --> 00:55:49,450
there's reproduction finding them on

1600
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,119
their plants and what they're doing I'm

1601
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:54,549
like you know so it's nice to be able to

1602
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,769
push the boundaries of what they're

1603
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:58,359
documented to do specifically and tell

1604
00:55:56,769 --> 00:55:59,949
people it's not documented for it

1605
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:01,809
generally we don't recommend to do it

1606
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:03,879
but this is what I would probably choose

1607
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:04,869
in your specific area it's built a

1608
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,460
little bit better for the lower

1609
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:07,990
humidities it's able to reproduce a

1610
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,639
little bit quicker than another species

1611
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,779
that we have you know and we kind of go

1612
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:13,000
from there and that's where the feedback

1613
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:14,530
comes in Shango that's where we can't

1614
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,599
just give somebody a program they walk

1615
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:18,190
away and use it and never hear from them

1616
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:20,380
again because there's always feedback

1617
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:22,599
that we can use from everybody that we

1618
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:24,039
can help other growers with on if this

1619
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:25,869
didn't work well you know we had another

1620
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:28,210
guy that did this you know what I mean

1621
00:56:25,869 --> 00:56:29,289
and it was very successful for them but

1622
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,300
a lot of it has to do with you know

1623
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:33,820
again from the very beginning is you

1624
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,920
know sanitation plant health monitoring

1625
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:37,780
scouting being able to know what pests

1626
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,220
are what so pest identification is key

1627
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,540
that we're using the correct species

1628
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:43,029
from the very beginning you know we're

1629
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:44,829
not going to be very successful so right

1630
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:47,260
I like it that can beneficial insects be

1631
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:50,050
used in outdoor crops yeah we use it

1632
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,319
many times yeah all last year all last

1633
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:53,560
year

1634
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:55,239
indoors is great outdoors yes for sure

1635
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:57,219
there's no problems using it do they do

1636
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:58,989
that do the beneficial insects walk away

1637
00:56:57,219 --> 00:57:00,659
from the cannabis plants I mean I always

1638
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:03,219
figured that released with an indoor

1639
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:05,739
program they were you know they were

1640
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:07,118
penned they were captured inside of the

1641
00:57:05,739 --> 00:57:09,639
greenhouse or the building or whatever

1642
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:12,068
but if you go outdoors you know they

1643
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:13,480
could just walk away yeah so it depends

1644
00:57:12,068 --> 00:57:15,579
on what you're using obviously you know

1645
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,199
there's Flyers that make me nervous on

1646
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:19,650
if you release them they're just gonna

1647
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:22,000
fly away but you can also create

1648
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:24,400
attractant plants to keep them near

1649
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,108
basically that gives them an additional

1650
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,358
food source if they don't find it on the

1651
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:29,529
plants at your art that you have as you

1652
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:31,119
talked about them walking away it

1653
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,769
becomes like an application technique as

1654
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,990
well you know if you're applying them

1655
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:36,670
directly onto your plant there's so much

1656
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:38,199
canopy space that these guys need to

1657
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,818
move you know how small they are you

1658
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:41,318
know in order to walk around a plant

1659
00:57:39,818 --> 00:57:43,239
it's going to take them quite a while to

1660
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:44,980
do so for the most part they're not

1661
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:47,049
going to crawl down your stem and out in

1662
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:48,490
the dirt and go somewhere else in our

1663
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,720
experience they generally stay on your

1664
00:57:48,489 --> 00:57:51,639
plant they're looking for food you know

1665
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:53,529
they're predators versus the pests that

1666
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:55,118
you guys have there you know a lot of

1667
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:56,320
the times they're slow because all

1668
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,460
they're doing is sitting there feeding

1669
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,260
on your planet you already mean

1670
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:00,789
versus versus what we offer people

1671
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,170
they're looking for food generally

1672
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:03,880
they're gonna be a little bit faster

1673
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:05,680
basically and they need to find food in

1674
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,619
order to maintain right on do you have

1675
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:10,149
to use higher application rates outdoors

1676
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:12,130
yeah again it you know it's a general

1677
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:13,389
question but depends on the region that

1678
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,400
you're in depends on the humidity that

1679
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:16,929
you are but again it depends on a plant

1680
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,150
counts as well and what the sizes of

1681
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:20,739
your canopy are we find it you know a

1682
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,030
six by six plants treated differently

1683
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:23,679
than it one by one plant there's a lot

1684
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:26,350
more canopy space that needs to be

1685
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,730
covered so yes I would say so yeah one

1686
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:29,829
of the things that I find interesting is

1687
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:32,980
that you know the these beneficial

1688
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:36,309
insects and and how they do what they do

1689
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:38,260
it's not it's not new it is something

1690
00:58:36,309 --> 00:58:41,380
that the horticulture industry has been

1691
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:45,160
using for decades and what you are

1692
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:46,599
bringing to the table is being the you

1693
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:48,819
know being the first person in the

1694
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:51,279
industry to start transitioning and in

1695
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,960
learning the ins and the outs of

1696
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,619
applying what's been used in

1697
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:59,409
horticulture for decades to specifically

1698
00:58:56,619 --> 00:59:01,750
what's going on in cannabis so as a

1699
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:04,389
corollary to that I have this question

1700
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,699
are there new any new beneficial insects

1701
00:59:04,389 --> 00:59:08,529
that you see coming online in the future

1702
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:11,980
is like is there like you know the the

1703
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:13,869
new one the new model or is that not

1704
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,090
does that not really happen much in the

1705
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:19,390
beneficial insects scene where you've

1706
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:22,750
got your you've got your set of specific

1707
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:25,569
and generalized beneficials and all of

1708
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:28,349
the novel 'no sand innovation is

1709
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:31,390
happening on application and education

1710
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:33,400
no it's a good question and for the most

1711
00:59:31,389 --> 00:59:35,379
part as far as I know and it could be

1712
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,349
false but I don't think it is a lot of

1713
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,570
things that are cultured and supplied in

1714
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:43,509
the United States that they have to be

1715
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:45,160
native to our specific area in order for

1716
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:47,890
us to offer them to other people so I

1717
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:50,230
think pretty much what here what is here

1718
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:52,059
now is what's gonna be around for a

1719
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:55,719
while there are companies that offer

1720
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:58,210
different species or additional species

1721
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:58,629
to do different things basically and

1722
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:01,240
each

1723
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:02,710
company has their own you know they have

1724
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:05,318
their own choices of what they want a

1725
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:07,298
culture on their own but you know when

1726
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:08,829
you start working with us again I think

1727
01:00:07,298 --> 01:00:12,099
like I said in our previous conversation

1728
01:00:08,829 --> 01:00:14,230
is that we try to take a lot of that

1729
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:15,609
information out for people and just give

1730
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:17,980
you what we feel is the most effective

1731
01:00:15,608 --> 01:00:19,239
and which limits you know to make keep

1732
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,858
it simple I guess you'd say with a lot

1733
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:24,008
of people is we try to simplify our

1734
01:00:20,858 --> 01:00:26,139
responses towards people but III I think

1735
01:00:24,009 --> 01:00:27,909
what it is is it needs to be native in

1736
01:00:26,139 --> 01:00:29,528
order for it to be sold and supplied

1737
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:32,170
here in the United States yeah right on

1738
01:00:29,528 --> 01:00:34,150
so um you know right here before we wrap

1739
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:37,389
up I want to give you you know a

1740
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:40,539
platform to talk specifically to the

1741
01:00:37,389 --> 01:00:42,788
commercial you know master growers who

1742
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:45,400
are listening and are interested in

1743
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:48,278
moving away from the synthetics or the

1744
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:52,088
sprays and in any way and move over but

1745
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:54,759
they still have got concerns about you

1746
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:58,449
know how much risk there will be during

1747
01:00:54,759 --> 01:01:01,690
the transition and also would they you

1748
01:00:58,449 --> 01:01:03,608
know decrease and yields so so you know

1749
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:06,519
why you just address that on our way out

1750
01:01:03,608 --> 01:01:08,288
here what do you say to the commercial

1751
01:01:06,518 --> 01:01:10,568
grower who wants to go in this direction

1752
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:13,869
but they just they need it put in the

1753
01:01:10,568 --> 01:01:16,420
right terms for them it's a great

1754
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:18,309
question and I think you know throughout

1755
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:21,130
our conversation today I've touched on a

1756
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:22,599
lot of points for for people to feel a

1757
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,490
little bit more comfortable using this

1758
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:26,109
as you know you touched on it about even

1759
01:01:24,489 --> 01:01:27,368
how beneficial insects have been

1760
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:29,380
cultured for decades you know what I

1761
01:01:27,369 --> 01:01:31,269
mean when I started doing using them 10

1762
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:32,528
years ago you know I remember going to a

1763
01:01:31,268 --> 01:01:34,118
class there was three people in the

1764
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:35,440
class then the next year there was 10

1765
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:36,759
and then there was 15 then there's a

1766
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,650
hundred then there was only standing

1767
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:40,990
room as the years go on and people

1768
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:43,329
become educated on what you can use them

1769
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:44,558
for I think that's really going to steer

1770
01:01:43,329 --> 01:01:46,900
a lot of people in the right direction

1771
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,160
a lot of the pesticide testing is going

1772
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,318
to steer people to use beneficial

1773
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,058
insects first and if they need to use

1774
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:53,920
chemicals by any means they've you know

1775
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:55,990
they in order to make them a little bit

1776
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,880
more comfortable they might reach for

1777
01:01:55,989 --> 01:01:59,679
that as well but I think what you're

1778
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,660
gonna see is higher flower content on

1779
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,278
the back end you know you're not going

1780
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:04,690
to be spraying your plants with anything

1781
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:06,518
which is gonna which is going to cause

1782
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:07,750
no stress which allows them to go to

1783
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:09,909
their natural capacity I mean that's

1784
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:11,900
what I saw when I ran trials ten years

1785
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:13,699
ago is 30% growth increase

1786
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,829
some plants that I just used beneficial

1787
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:17,989
insects for you know aphids spider mites

1788
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:20,660
fungus gnats versus a traditional

1789
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:22,608
program of horticultural oils that I use

1790
01:02:20,659 --> 01:02:24,980
on a different plant basically 30 30

1791
01:02:22,608 --> 01:02:27,288
percent increase it's amazing to see and

1792
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:29,329
once you see start believing and then

1793
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:30,829
you start and then you start seeking

1794
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:33,170
more information on God how can I do

1795
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:35,059
this even better we get a lot of reports

1796
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:36,858
from a lot of different people telling

1797
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:38,960
us about how healthy their plants are

1798
01:02:36,858 --> 01:02:41,568
these days and how much more flour

1799
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,579
they're receiving and you know it's it's

1800
01:02:41,568 --> 01:02:45,980
not everybody but there are people that

1801
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:47,720
have really taken the time to do that

1802
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,298
and to seek the information to be

1803
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:51,889
effective for it and I don't want to

1804
01:02:50,298 --> 01:02:53,778
push anybody to do it if they don't want

1805
01:02:51,889 --> 01:02:55,219
to again you know our website says

1806
01:02:53,778 --> 01:02:56,929
choose beneficial insects if you're

1807
01:02:55,219 --> 01:02:58,699
interested we're more than happy to help

1808
01:02:56,929 --> 01:03:01,308
and to give you the specific information

1809
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:02,750
that you need and to help you you know

1810
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:04,730
from day one moving forward because

1811
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:06,650
obviously we want to work with you five

1812
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,358
years down the road we we don't want to

1813
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:09,680
just talk with you one day give you

1814
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:11,420
product it doesn't work and you be done

1815
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:12,649
with it even if somebody doesn't order a

1816
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,000
product for awhile we still call and

1817
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:15,559
follow-up to see how things are going

1818
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,278
what happened what can we do different

1819
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:21,079
you know I mean so there is it can be

1820
01:03:19,278 --> 01:03:23,210
time-consuming for some people to try to

1821
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:24,230
learn how to do this but if you have

1822
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:26,088
somebody at your company that's willing

1823
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:28,068
to grasp this and really go into and

1824
01:03:26,088 --> 01:03:29,420
seek information and do it then that's

1825
01:03:28,068 --> 01:03:31,909
gonna be your best bet at this stage

1826
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:33,409

nature and not down with synthetic

1832
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:48,920
inputs and we don't take you know

1833

synthetic input advertising money and so

garden pests under control by working

1837
