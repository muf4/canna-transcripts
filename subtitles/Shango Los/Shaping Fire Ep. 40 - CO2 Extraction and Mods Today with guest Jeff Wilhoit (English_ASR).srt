00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:10,050
Cannabis extraction has blown up and it

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,849
will continue to blow up and become

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,920
bigger and bigger for the foreseeable

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,019
future the array of products in the

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,359
market and the number of extraction labs

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:20,368
and the varieties of final products

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,800
possible coming out of these labs have

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,960
all increased at a wicked fast rate if

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,880
extraction is exploding in every

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,278
direction and nug runs our standard now

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,559
not a rarity like it was just five years

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,869
ago it's a really good time to be a

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,539
professional extractor or an extracts

15
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,549
connoisseur if you want to learn about

16
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,170
cannabis health business and technique

17
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,699

46
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:38,489
today my guest is Jeff will Hoyt you may

47
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,310
know Jeff Wilhoit as cannabis Reverend

48
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,839
on instagram or as Jeff Church another

49
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,670
name he used during the early days of

50
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,770
cannabis but now that he's working

51
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,540
solely in the legal cannabis industry

52
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,118
he's allowing me for the first time to

53
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,618
use his real name Jeff has been in

54
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,688
professional cannabis for decades

55
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:56,849
working as a Canada cannabis patient

56
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,949
rights advocate and providing cannabis

57
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,839
medicine for patients throughout this

58
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,670
time he was refining his skills and

59
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,500
mastering all of the modern extraction

60
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,570
techniques and many of the ancient ones

61
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,189
too he's been running licensed

62
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,618
professional cannabis extraction labs

63
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,598
for several years now he is presently

64
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,800
still an ardent patient advocate but

65
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,199
he's also director of X

66
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,420
tracks at puffin farm today we're gonna

67
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,369
start by explaining co2 extraction and

68
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,649
then move on to the recent improvements

69
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,490
in co2 extraction and modifying co2

70
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,060
machines

71
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,719
welcome to the show Jeff glad to be here

72
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,789
thank you

73
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,469
right on so I'm excited to have you back

74
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:33,569
on the show so that we can kind of

75
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:36,990
update our prior conversation talking

76
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,310
about co2 extractions because you know

77
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,350
the last time we had you on the show is

78
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,039
a couple years and a lot has changed in

79
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:47,310
co2 in that time and you know I'm lucky

80
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:50,039
that when I did my stint as CEO of green

81
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,500
lion farms I got to be in the co2 lab

82
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,199
and was able to learn a lot but most

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,780
people have never been in a co2 lab let

84
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:01,739
alone any extraction lab would you walk

85
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,599
us through generally how a co2 extractor

86
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,670
functions and most importantly the

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,639
differences between supercritical and

88
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:10,649
subcritical extraction yeah definitely

89
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,679
definitely so it's you know like any

90
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:17,610
other solvent extraction you have a

91
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,560
solvent that is fed in through an

92
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,330
extraction vessel where you have plant

93
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,170
material packed in there and then

94
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:28,380
there's a secondary vessel that is

95
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,958
downstream from there where the solvent

96
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:34,049
and the extract that cannabinoids

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,430
terpenes and other constituents are

98
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:43,230
separated from the solvent and so you

99
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:46,530
know with co2 it's done either in a

100
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:50,849
subcritical liquid or supercritical

101
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:55,819
phase and so kind of the difference

102
00:03:50,849 --> 00:04:00,629
between that is is relative to

103
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:03,780
temperature and pressure the state that

104
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:09,349
the solvent itself is in so at regular

105
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:15,930
atmosphere we have co2 as a gas if you

106
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:17,969
chill that dat and pressurize it so put

107
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,129
it into a vessel where it's where it's

108
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,470
able to hold the pressure it will turn

109
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:27,449
from a gas into a liquid and and then

110
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,639
that that liquid

111
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,788
can then be further heated and

112
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,449
pressurized even further to take it

113
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:38,158
through the subcritical phase and at

114
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:42,569
higher pressures and temperatures up

115
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:45,269
into the supercritical phase so they're

116
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:49,439
all just kind of different ways that the

117
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:51,718
solvent acts when it's a liquid it acts

118
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,289
just like a liquid a little saturate a

119
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:58,310
medium it'll extract when it's

120
00:04:55,288 --> 00:05:05,038
subcritical it goes a little bit deeper

121
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:08,788
and the basically the the different

122
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:11,490
constituents are going to be soluble at

123
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:14,278
different levels so if you have a higher

124
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,439
pressure certain things will be more

125
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:19,620
extractable there than they are at a

126
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:24,539
lower pressure terpenes in particular

127
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:29,490
are extractable at low pressures with

128
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:31,019
co2 so you know I relative Leeloo you

129
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,710
know you can definitely do atropine

130
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:37,468
extraction at 1100 psi if you want

131
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:40,888
cannabinoids you're gonna have to go to

132
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:42,778
a higher to a higher pressure or take

133
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,658
longer to do the extraction because

134
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:47,728
they're less extractable at the lower

135
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:50,430
pressure so that's kind of the main

136
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:55,408
difference between every other solvent

137
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:58,408
that's used and co2 is this pressure

138
00:05:55,408 --> 00:06:01,528
component to it you know with butane and

139
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:03,778
alcohol heat is a considerate

140
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:06,300
consideration when you when you run

141
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:09,468
either of those solvents hot you're

142
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,120
going to produce an extract that has

143
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:13,740
more constituents in it all right

144
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,759
there's there's going to be more

145
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:21,329
chlorophyll with a with a hot extraction

146
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:25,319
you know yeah so so basically co2

147
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:28,079
extractions very simple liquid fed

148
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,960
through the plant material the plant the

149
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:35,370
cannabinoids and terpenoids are

150
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:40,310
extracted then that higher pressure

151
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:43,680
liquid goes through a valve

152
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:47,970
that is that regulates the flow but it

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,970
also sets the pressure in the extraction

154
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:53,340
vessel at a higher point than in the

155
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:56,040
separation vessel what that does is it

156
00:06:53,339 --> 00:07:00,259
takes that liquid or super critical or

157
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:04,860
subcritical subcritical fluid and it

158
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:06,930
changes it into a gas state right so

159
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,740
you'll also have heat on the separators

160
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,259
that are there aiding in this as well

161
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,019
but what happens there is you've got all

162
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:19,379
of your extract is in the fluid and then

163
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,629
once that fluid is turned into a gas the

164
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:25,050
extract is left behind and the gas is

165
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:27,990
able to rise and be funneled off it

166
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,680
through the piping into another into

167
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,300
another part of the extraction machine

168
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,819
having that having that flexibility

169
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,430
between supercritical and subcritical

170
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,319
it's almost like you get to two tools

171
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,699
for the price of one because you've got

172
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,009
some flexibility on how you run your

173
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,439
material well I mean it's really a

174
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:50,129
rainbow tool set not just two tools

175
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:54,060
because you know subcritical at low

176
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:56,579
pressure is going to extract one set of

177
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,829
constituents and the higher the pressure

178
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,109
gets and the higher the temperature gets

179
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:03,469
the more constituents that you're going

180
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:06,000
to extract until you hit supercritical

181
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,790
you know and then it just keeps on

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,470
further opening up what the constituents

183
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,350
are that it's going to easily extract

184
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:16,020
the higher the pressure is so but you

185
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:19,140
know it's it's it can be selective you

186
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:21,240
know so you can remove you can target

187
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,689
certain constituents and leave other

188
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,000
ones behind with with pressure there's

189
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:29,420
there's a there's some really

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,850
interesting things that are done on some

191
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,320
extractors where they have a separation

192
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:38,490
you've got your higher pressure

193
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,090
extraction then you have three cascading

194
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,480
lower pressure separators where your

195
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,460
cannabinoids and thicker wax your

196
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,409
constituents are gonna fall out in the

197
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,060
first separator because it's at a higher

198
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:56,689
pressure then as the pressure goes down

199
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:59,149
you know terpenes become insoluble in

200
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,940
that liquid co2 and so they drop out and

201
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:04,819
and so on so you're able to kind of

202
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,400
fraction things out that way with

203
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,320
different pressures right on cool so so

204
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,000
fright for anybody who's listening who's

205
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,310
like oh my god this is gonna be a really

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,480
technical show don't don't worry it's

207
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:15,588
not gonna be like this the whole time

208
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,850
because actually what we're it's mostly

209
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,940
gonna be talking about today our

210
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:22,730
applications for co2 and and how co2

211
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,990
extractions are being used now so so I

212
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,610
well you know we needed to make sure we

213
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,919
get through the supercritical 4 versus

214
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,440
subcritical but but stay with us here so

215
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,919
so so let's talk about that of our first

216
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:37,910
application Jeff so so you know the the

217
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:41,569
oil that is coming out of co2 labs for

218
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:44,000
for dabbing or vaping now is incredibly

219
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,980
tasty and it's and it's way better than

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,089
the stuff that was coming out of labs in

221
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:52,789
like 2014-2015 where we're unfortunately

222
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:56,900
a lot of co2 got a bad reputation for

223
00:09:52,789 --> 00:10:00,019
not being tasty what has changed during

224
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:02,620
that time between like you know 2014-15

225
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:06,439
and now that's made such a profound

226
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:09,919
impact on the tastiness of co2 products

227
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:14,660
yeah so so a lot has really changed in

228
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:17,360
the marketplace so uh I would say for my

229
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:21,500
practices in the lab I've really come

230
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,169
full circle you know jumping into co2 I

231
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,539
was originally producing products that

232
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:30,259
were very akin to the oil that I'm

233
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:34,490
producing now back then and then you

234
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:38,750
know and that was really on quality of

235
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:42,709
material right you know I was running

236
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:44,419
full nug back in 2013 at the you know

237
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,849
first runs that we were doing we had

238
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:49,909
some really amazing oils that came out

239
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:52,730
that didn't need any winterization and

240
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:56,149
you know the quality of the material was

241
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:59,028
just spectacular but the reality is is

242
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:01,579
back then that quality material was not

243
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:04,939
going to produce enough oil to make it

244
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,690
profitable so everybody can turn to the

245
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:11,970
other direction and said oh well

246
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:15,840
this trim makes really you know good

247
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,940
fiscal sense and so I'd say that the

248
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,610
majority of processors went that way

249
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,590
there's a couple processors that I know

250
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,620
of that always have tried to strive for

251
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:28,730
having that highest quality input

252
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,220
material to make that highest quality

253
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:35,399
extract but it really wasn't the case

254
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,560
and so ninety five percent plus of the

255
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,000
market has really kind of just been this

256
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,529
oil that's like blah it doesn't really

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,590
it doesn't really excite you too much

258
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:50,220
you smoke it you'll get your high but

259
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:53,480
it's not a very unique high it's very

260
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,070
similar to you know most other

261
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,779
cartridges that that are out there so

262
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:05,550
it's kind of yeah and and really you

263
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:09,329
know back in the day you know there was

264
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:12,539
so little knowledge about how to retain

265
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:14,460
terpenes and your extract and and do

266
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:16,829
this that you would just do your

267
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:21,240
extraction you'd get this big puck of

268
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:24,960
waxy oil you douse it in alcohol and

269
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,940
then you would cook the cook the extract

270
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,379
in a row to vape to to remove that

271
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,230
alcohol well when you do that you're

272
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:34,439
removing the majority of the terpenes

273
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:37,289
right and most companies they would just

274
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,570
go all the way down until they had like

275
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,699
a thicker oil that way they knew that

276
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:44,640
the majority of the alcohol was out of

277
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:48,180
it but they'd end up with an oil that

278
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,029
for the cartridge technology was not

279
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,009
feasible to smoke and so a lot of

280
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:56,129
companies back then they would cut it

281
00:12:53,009 --> 00:13:01,799
with propylene glycol as a viscosity

282
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:04,889
altering agent and you know we know that

283
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:09,029
propylene glycol vaporizing it is really

284
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:10,470
unhealthy you know it's there's there's

285
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:14,100
been a lot of you know government

286
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:16,950
studies have come out about the tobacco

287
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,379
vaping industry and it's the same thing

288
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,100
you know a propylene glycol we've just

289
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:22,439
been a little bit

290
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,790
candidate or they you know people back

291
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,650
in the day we're putting cannabis in

292
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:28,289
there which you know might even be a

293
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:30,389
little you know a little bit better than

294
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:34,699
vaping nicotine because you've got some

295
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:37,980
cancer-causing orchid anti-cancer

296
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:42,050
potentials in an oil right

297
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:49,409
anyways that's that that's not our there

298
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:51,299
but now now people are starting to get

299
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:53,459
to the point where they're making a

300
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:56,609
product that instead of having to

301
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:01,560
compromise and add in these these cuts

302
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:03,389
or leave alcohol in your extract to keep

303
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,759
the viscosity right there were all kinds

304
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:08,509
of things that that were done to kind of

305
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:13,019
make this alcohol extracted or

306
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:15,240
winterized oil be something that the

307
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:19,379
market desired but nobody was really

308
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,720
able to make it unique you know I mean

309
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:26,429
you'd have a little flavor of the strain

310
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:29,340
that you were vaping but it wasn't it

311
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:31,049
wasn't like smelling the flower and so

312
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,480
that's that's really where we've come to

313
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:35,639
you today is you know we're back to the

314
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,889
point where cannabis is worthless you

315
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,529
know the the wholesale market on on

316
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:44,639
cannabis it's it's so cheap

317
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:48,720
so now if you're an extractor you know I

318
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:52,199
mean sure it still costs twice the

319
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,320
amount to buy flour as it does to buy

320
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:59,940
trim but if the product that you're

321
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:03,360
getting is way way more than twice you

322
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:08,330
know preferable by the consumers then it

323
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:11,490
makes sense to do that so you know what

324
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:15,509
now what we're doing is just using full

325
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:18,389
flour and in a lot of cases it's trimmed

326
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:21,090
flour that we're using as well so

327
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:24,330
something that would be bag ready and

328
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:28,019
would have been sold as flour back in

329
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:30,540
2013 because it was worth so much now

330
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:34,490
there's so much cannabis on the market

331
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:37,169
that it's not worth as much

332
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,810
so yeah that's that's really you know

333
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:43,319
what we're doing now is sourcing this

334
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:47,069
this amazing material and we're able to

335
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,800
do complete our extractions without

336
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:52,560
having to winterize if we were running

337
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,769
trim we would have tons and tons of wax

338
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:58,889
a lot lots of lots of lipids in our

339
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:01,559
extract and it wouldn't be something you

340
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:04,350
would want to smoke out of vapor you

341
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,269
know smoking lipids is it they're pretty

342
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,279
harsh you know they're they're not

343
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:11,490
something you really want to want to

344
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,139
take a nice fat dab of so you know I was

345
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,470
thinking - the market dynamics that you

346
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:19,289
were describing where you're able to get

347
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,389
these not only an uh drun but a trimmed

348
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:26,370
nug run compared to what it was like

349
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:28,350
before a the you know where the value

350
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:32,340
has shifted in the market the prices

351
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:36,600
plummeted on flour which is really bad

352
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:40,649
for the producer grower on the farm but

353
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:43,649
on the other side it's a huge boon for

354
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:46,199
the customer who's now getting a much

355
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:48,299
preferable product at the same price

356
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:53,460
that they were getting you know cart

357
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:57,299
sand dabs for back in 2014 and also you

358
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:59,250
know in your role as the extractor I'm

359
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:01,829
you know I just got to assume that it's

360
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:05,490
way more satisfying to be working with

361
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,350
full flour let alone trimmed flour again

362
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,299
than just using the trim I mean it's got

363
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:12,299
to be so much better and unfortunately

364
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:16,588
the farmers losing but but you and the

365
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:18,599
customer are winning yeah and and you

366
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:21,539
know I don't know if it's so much that

367
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,179
the farmers losing yeah sure they're not

368
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:27,740
getting the same prohibition dollars

369
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:31,259
that people were getting back in 2013

370
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:33,839
but it's a commodity and the market has

371
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:36,480
set the price and you know that there's

372
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:40,109
gonna be a price for how much is being

373
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,569
produced you know so yeah you know it's

374
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:45,719
it's definitely sad the farmer is always

375
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:47,450
always kind of losing out in this market

376
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,059
no matter which way you look

377
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,750
the price is going to go down until it

378
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:56,369
hits that spot where it levels out but

379
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:59,819
but yeah it's it's amazing you know when

380
00:17:56,369 --> 00:18:05,369
I when I crack open a you know nice big

381
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:10,169
8,000 gram bag of flowers and I'm

382
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:13,439
pulling out these nugs that are 6 8 10

383
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,660
inches long some of them and shoving

384
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,660
them into the extractor I mean it's it's

385
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,940
just an amazing thing

386
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,650
yeah way way more satisfying so so I got

387
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,500
one more question for you before we go

388
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,670
to our first break and and you know you

389
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,190
and I have known each other for a long

390
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:30,600
time now and I and I know that that you

391
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,690
know you go back working with patients

392
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:37,049
and you know you have you know helps

393
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:39,660
patients understand what RS Oh Rick

394
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,299
Simpson oil also known as ethanol hash

395
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,250
oil preferably is and how to use it and

396
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:46,440
stuff so I know it's got a place close

397
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,529
to your heart and I also know that co2

398
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,019
is close to your heart as well and you

399
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,539
know in this in this new adult rec

400
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:59,420
market I'm finding people are selling

401
00:18:54,539 --> 00:19:03,299
stuff as co2 RSO which to me sounds like

402
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:05,550
an oxymoron because the whole point of

403
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:07,950
co2 is that it's a it's a partial

404
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:10,169
extraction and you're not getting the

405
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,710
whole plant lipids for example like you

406
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:17,070
said you don't want for a dabble oil but

407
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:19,350
you do want in an RSO do you believe

408
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:21,839
that there's you know realistic room in

409
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:25,319
a market for a co2 RSO or do you think

410
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:28,459
that as I do it's people trying to get

411
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:30,929
to an RSO product by cutting corners

412
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,870
well you know if you were gonna cut

413
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,340
corners it would not be extracting it

414
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:39,659
with co2

415
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:43,409
you know RSO is is something you know

416
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,670
Rick Simpson oil right for for lack of a

417
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,740
better name I mean he's the one that

418
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:50,340
popularized this this is a solvent

419
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:53,130
extraction technique so you know doing

420
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:55,500
it with ethanol is is probably the most

421
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,150
cost-effective way to do it and yeah

422
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,099
it's gonna have more

423
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,290
it's gonna have chlorophylls in there

424
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:04,879
where your co2 extract

425
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:07,589
is going to be devoid of chlorophylls

426
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,370
you know it's it's just it's a

427
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:15,480
constituent that is not as extractable

428
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:18,329
with co2 so Canada to answer your

429
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:23,180
question it's it's a different product

430
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:26,759
for sure you know so I don't know if co2

431
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,440
RSO is the is the best term but I think

432
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,670
that what they're trying to get at is

433
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:35,039
we've got this oil that we're selling

434
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:38,789
you as a vapor izybelle product but

435
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:44,099
really we're calling it RSO so that the

436
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:46,619
consumer knows that we've decarbonise oh

437
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:51,509
I think you know even though they're

438
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:52,979
completely different as far as the

439
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:57,390
appearance of the product you're gonna

440
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:01,289
have a much a much different product

441
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:04,230
from co2 but I think that the effect and

442
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,490
the desired you know the desired effect

443
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:11,069
is going to be the same you're gonna

444
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:14,250
have a D carbs cannabinoid load in a co2

445
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:18,359
oil but it's much more expensive to

446
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:20,069
produce so you know I don't know I'm not

447
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,619
sure if that's the the best way to

448
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:24,089
produce an RSO yeah I guess I guess if

449
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,009
that's the equipment you have that's the

450
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:27,750
equipment you use right if your lab is

451
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,970
your co2 lab and you don't have an

452
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,589
ethanol lab well looks like you're

453
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,769
making co2 are so and I got to admit

454
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:36,539
that you're kind of repackaging of my

455
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,160
perspective on it makes me feel actually

456
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:41,639
a lot better because when I see it in

457
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,580
the stores I feel like people are trying

458
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,120
to cross market a product that's clearly

459
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:50,609
not a whole plant ethanol hash oil from

460
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,109
co2 but I like your interpretation of

461
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:54,689
like you know maybe they're not trying

462
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:58,529
to get away with something maybe they

463
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:01,710
have to use the term RSO to signal to

464
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:03,779
the consumer that this is ad carved

465
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,519
edible product because we don't we

466
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,519
haven't really developed that language

467
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:14,039
yet for marketing well here's here's the

468
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:15,240
you know as far as what the Liquor

469
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,369
Control Board allows you to

470
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,660
you're only allowed to sell 10 milligram

471
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:24,000
size servings if it's for eating right

472
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:28,830
so there's no way you would be able to

473
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,859
sell an RSO for eating so they've

474
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:33,720
confused it in that sense to wear all of

475
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:36,569
these processors are having to produce

476
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,750
an RSO and sell it for vaporization

477
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:44,939
which is not what anybody should be

478
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:46,799
doing with you know so yeah it's it's

479
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,929
definitely interesting but there are

480
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,000
lots of RSO carts out there on the

481
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:54,210
market which really surprises me that

482
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,289
you know people put this chlorophyll

483
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,670
rich alcohol extract into a cartridge

484
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:02,069
you know but that's that's a whole

485
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:06,630
nother thing you know other you know I

486
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:09,109
think that the the term RSO is I don't

487
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:12,090
know I think we need to get away from

488
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:14,428
that you know my personal thoughts are

489
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:17,609
if it's an ethanol extract should call

490
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:21,780
it eh-oh ethanol hash oil just like BHO

491
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:25,109
is butane hash oil Pho is propane hash

492
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:27,450
oil you know what it's it's more

493
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:30,269
scientifically correct than calling it

494
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:35,490
Rick Simpson oil which really describes

495
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:37,259
a man who brought this medicine to to

496
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,440
the public you know the the ability to

497
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:42,779
make it and actually no I would I would

498
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,920
venture to say that nobody in the

499
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:49,769
recreational market is making RSO the

500
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,679
way that Rick Simpson did he is naphtha

501
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:55,558
which is a really kind of nasty solvent

502
00:23:52,679 --> 00:24:02,340
but it's readily available and even

503
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:05,190
though it's got some carcinogenic having

504
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:08,009
a really heavy load for these patients

505
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,500
was the most important thing so at that

506
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:12,990
time you know even though there was some

507
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,420
bad coming in with the medicine the good

508
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,250
outweighed it and he saved a lot of

509
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,308
people and so that that's really where

510
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,890
where it came from you know the RSO it's

511
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:26,549
it's really just that term because this

512
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:29,880
guy was popularized it but technically

513
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:33,690
RSO rick simpson didn't have anything to

514
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,210
do with that co2 oil that's the co2 RSO

515
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,308
or any of the other RSO on the market

516
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,380
other than the fact that his name is

517
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:42,509
what they're using right on right on

518
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,910
yeah it's amazing how many people talk

519
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:48,140
about RSO four things without actually

520
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:51,750
knowing what it can you know what it's

521
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:54,270
made of in a particular process but you

522
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,549
know I get that's just all part of being

523
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:58,679
in an early market and us figuring out

524
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,659
ourselves what to call it to communicate

525
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,640
to the consumers and God help the

526
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,190
consumer trying to get educated and you

527
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,890
know as this as this education drifts

528
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:12,120
down slowly but surely do the retail so

529
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:15,770
let's go go ahead well we're on that you

530
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:19,319
know so co2 when you when you look at

531
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:22,769
what the consumer perceives co2 as it's

532
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:26,730
got a really bad name and you know most

533
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:29,609
co2 is pretty bland and so at puffing

534
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,009
farm what we've done is we've kind of

535
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:35,159
said we're setting a standard that it

536
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:37,679
has to be of at least this quality for

537
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,500
it to be extra virgin flower oil and

538
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,540
we're not really you know we say on the

539
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,970
package its processed with co2 so it's

540
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,918
it's full disclosure to to everybody

541
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:49,319
that that's what's being done but we're

542
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:51,750
trying to set it apart from co2 by

543
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:54,659
calling it the EVF oh the extra virgin

544
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,960
flower oil to kind of make this new

545
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,990
subset because our co2 doesn't really

546
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,200
fit in with you know what most of the

547
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:07,410
market is still today and the difference

548
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,940
is the difference is the flower the

549
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:14,790
difference is the non winterization

550
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:17,460
the difference is it tastes just like

551
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:20,039
the flower like if you took that flower

552
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,799
and broke it apart and smelled it that's

553
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:26,339
the flavor that you're getting from an e

554
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,849
vfo cart if you're not getting if it

555
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:32,939
doesn't equal like that and if it's not

556
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:35,269
lipid free enough it goes into

557
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,549
winterized oil and that gets sold to a

558
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:39,839
processor for making edibles right on

559
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:42,960
dude and that is why when

560
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,879
I'm shopping in Washington I buy your

561

564
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:54,419

566
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,950
owner you are incredibly busy in reality

567
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,808
you are responsible for everything your

568
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,819
company does you've got so many

569
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:04,319
responsibilities every single day that

570
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,538
often you just don't have the time to

571
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,668
really dig into your marketing as deeply

572
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:09,929
as you'd like you know there's more that

573
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,880
you could do to reach out to new

574
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,710
customers and encourage loyalty and the

575
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,480
customers you do have but you certainly

576
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,829
don't have the time for it and you're

577
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,589
not really ready to hire someone

578
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:22,349
full-time for that role either for you I

579
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:24,449

you know

583
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:31,769
most marketing firms are excited to make

584
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,339
your logo packaging and website very

585
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:34,079
pretty

586
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:35,788
but they leave responsibility for

587
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,199
improving your bottom line up to you

588
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:39,089
they don't want that kind of

589
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,710
responsibility but that's pretty much

590
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:43,379
the most important part of marketing

591
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,808

storefront and keep them coming back to

595
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,720

596
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,519
happen to be a new cannabis company or

597
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,259
an established company moving from

598
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,558
medical to adult use in your state

599
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:03,210
Kirsten especially can help you not only

600
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,788
is she well versed in marketing and

601
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,278
finance but she totally gets cannabis

602

603
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:12,778
farmers and the particular needs of

604
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,210
startups check out what she did recently

605
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:18,349
for moon time medicinals in Humboldt

606
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:20,370
County at moon time medicinals calm

607
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:22,319
Kirsten and her team put together a

608
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:24,359
whole brand package for them built their

609
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,939
website and wrote their sales materials

610
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,500
no doubt this is a paid commercial spot

611
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,450
but that does not mean that they bought

612
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,099
my opinion I've worked with blunt

613
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,169
branding on four projects now for

614
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:35,369
various clients and every single time

615
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:37,679
they have done more than they've

616
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:40,229
promised and over delivered on results I

617
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,360
love how they generate new revenue and

618
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,038
focus on that as the goal instead of

619
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,199
just making you a pretty logo

620
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,119
similarly every single friend I've

621
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,000
referred them to has come back to thank

622
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,500

shaping fire I'm your host Shango losan

691
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,970
our guest this week is Jeff Wilhoit

692
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:31,500
director of extracts at puffin farm so

693
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,269
before the break we were talking about

694
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,680
you know just kind of some general

695
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:37,950
questions that have been coming up

696
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,170
contemporarily about co2 and co2

697
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:43,140
products but but Jeff I want to talk

698
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:45,420
more in this second set about best

699
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,140
practices and some of the things that

700
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:52,140
can happen in the lab to make a better

701
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,540
product so you know in this section I

702
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,820
will be upfront that you know I get over

703
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:59,159
my head fast in a lab and I'm not gonna

704
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:01,649
front and pretend to know extraction at

705
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,900
your level so I'm gonna I want to I want

706
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:06,180
to lean on your depth a little bit and

707
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,560
have you guide where to go next so so

708
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,799
let's talk a little bit about best

709
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:13,799
practices in your lab so so you know you

710
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,440
know what I would like you to share with

711
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:20,339
us is some of the simple things that you

712
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,850
have realized in your lab between you

713
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:27,089
know the the early days of 2014 and now

714
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:29,549
that is causing you to develop this

715
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:32,279
product that's you know winning awards

716
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:34,409
and is clearly popular in the market and

717
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,789
and and so when we talked about this

718
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,100
setting up the show some of the stuff

719
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:40,889
that you had to say was actually really

720
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,839
quite simple so so let's start what

721
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:46,530
would you say is one best practice in

722
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:48,359
your co2 lab that is that is leading to

723
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:50,549
these these championship oils that

724
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,039
you're putting on the market well so

725
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:55,339
there's there's one one thing I've

726
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,859
already talked about it quite a bit is

727
00:32:55,339 --> 00:33:01,109
quality material you know it's it's that

728
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:03,029
quality in quality out you know we call

729
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:07,079
it extra virgin flower oil because it's

730
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:11,759
flower oil not trim oil and you know

731
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:13,769
having that high quality material leads

732
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:18,210
to an extract that you're not gonna have

733
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:20,160
to winterize and you know if you

734
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,740
winterize your your you're losing

735
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:26,730
terpenes it's it's it's just that plain

736
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:29,009
and simple your most volatile terpenes

737
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:31,950
which are the ones that you'll smell

738
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:33,750
when you break open a bud those are

739
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:38,000
going to go out with your alcohol when

740
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:41,670
you when you when you do that and it's

741
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,390
it's a little bit more of a full plant

742
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:48,200
extract if you leave a little bit of

743
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:51,930
that in there if you're not removing

744
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,059
anything with a secondary solvent you

745
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:58,920
know that that's selective and basically

746
00:33:54,059 --> 00:34:00,990
won't extract certain constituents then

747
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:05,100
then you're you're really having that

748
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:09,659
full plant full plant extract it's you

749
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:14,549
know I'd say another really really key

750
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:18,809
thing is we don't deconstruct things you

751
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:21,120
know it's it's all one extraction if you

752
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:23,789
deconstruct things if you if you take

753
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,369
the terpenes and and and separate them

754
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:28,199
off and then you take the cannabinoids

755
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:29,909
and separate them off you've got these

756
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,159
two different fractions and then then

757
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,859
you winterized the cannabinoid fraction

758
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,269
to remove lipids and then get that you

759
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,720
know as clean as you can and then you

760
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:46,590
add back the terpene fraction things

761
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:49,019
don't always match up very close to what

762
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,820
the flour was that it came from because

763
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:53,369
I would think that as you're as you're

764
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,280
separating out of the parts you're

765
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:59,940
you're separating an analogue source

766
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,340
into kind of digital parts and there's a

767
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,539
little bit lost and each part so when

768
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,170
you put it back together

769
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:10,860
you're losing quite a sum there's

770
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,920
definitely lost parts there's changed

771
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:18,090
parts so if you if you have to to heat

772
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,130
something up to the point where you know

773
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:22,440
or pull it into deep enough vacuum to

774
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:24,539
the point where it's going to distill

775
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,970
out like the terpenes so if you if you

776
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,829
remove those terpenes first

777
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:31,230
there's something that's been changed

778
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:34,589
because they were removed if you extract

779
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:37,710
it all with a single solvent all of it

780
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:42,929
has been treated the same way so you're

781
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:45,679
gonna have a product that is very very

782
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:49,259
close to what the plant was rather than

783
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:52,019
removed and then you know deconstructed

784
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:55,740
had been reconstructed right on so so

785
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:58,469
would you throw in a quick description

786
00:35:55,739 --> 00:36:00,989
of what winterizing is because while you

787
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:03,480
and I use it as common parlance a lot of

788
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:08,629
folks in the industry don't yeah so

789
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,630
winterizing is simply the act of

790
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:15,900
removing the lipid content and so what

791
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:19,230
what you do is you take your oil and you

792
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:26,519
put that into alcohol you dissolve the

793
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:29,699
the oil into alcohol lipids are not most

794
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:36,318
lipids are not very soluble in alcohol

795
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:40,019
and so they'll stay kind of they'll

796
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:42,989
they'll not dissolve into a suspension

797
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:47,579
right so you're able to filter them out

798
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:53,219
now if you freeze that alcohol and oil

799
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:57,660
mixture or winterize it even more lipid

800
00:36:53,219 --> 00:37:00,689
lipids will solidify and the terpenes

801
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:04,739
and cannabinoids stay in the liquid

802
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:06,510
solution of alcohol so winterization you

803
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:08,729
put your oil in the alcohol you put that

804
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:13,260
alcohol and oil into the freezer you

805
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:15,440
freeze it then you filter it usually

806
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,240
with some sort of vacuum filtration

807
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,309
basically pouring it into a filter and

808
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:23,759
having a vacuum draw on the bottom of

809
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:25,769
that filter so that the alcohol soluble

810
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,630
constituents come through and you're

811
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:32,460
left with a puck of lipids on the filter

812
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:35,700
so that's that's winterizing right on

813
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,829
the brief got all of this oil that's

814
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:39,118
diluted in alcohol and you've got to

815
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:41,548
remove the alcohol

816
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,229
so to bring this full circle and bring

817
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:45,179
it back home and the reason why you do

818
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:47,248
winterize is because you want to remove

819
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:50,509
these lipids which are harsh so you go

820
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:53,308
through this process so that the the end

821
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:55,519
smokeable product is much more enjoyable

822
00:37:53,309 --> 00:38:01,798
to the consumer

823
00:37:55,518 --> 00:38:06,598
exactly exactly you know it's yeah right

824
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:09,298
it's it's a clear product as well so so

825
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,509
to the eye it's a little bit more

826
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:16,048
desirable

827
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:18,748
winterization had been used to put it in

828
00:38:16,048 --> 00:38:22,650
earlier cart technology right so

829
00:38:18,748 --> 00:38:24,868
cartridge technology the lipids would

830
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:28,318
just gum it all up nowadays you could

831
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:29,910
put raw co2 that's full of lipids into a

832
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:32,818
cartridge I wouldn't recommend it to

833
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:35,159
anybody but the technology is there

834
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:36,599
where we're able to smoke thicker and

835
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,028
thicker things you can put pure

836
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,999
distillate into a cartridge and you know

837
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:45,420
that's the thickest okay but you're

838
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:48,838
gonna have you know terpene free for the

839
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,389
most part into a cartridge so and the

840
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:52,858
benefit of that is from all these new

841
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:56,848
carts because that would never have

842
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:58,798
worked with a wicking cart no exactly it

843
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:02,548
you know the C cell technology in

844
00:38:58,798 --> 00:39:06,538
particular is is really making for the

845
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:09,929
ability for us to vaporize anything yeah

846
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:12,569
big big big fans of C cell as well yeah

847
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:13,978
so so let's let's lock down another best

848
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:16,228
practice so what's something else that

849
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:21,358
you're doing in the lab that that you're

850
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:24,659
finding a lot of value in so you know

851
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:30,598
one one thing that that I really like to

852
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:34,649
do in the lab is is reuse the co2 and

853
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:37,588
you know so Eden labs and and other

854
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:41,190
companies they'll tell you don't reuse

855
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:44,759
your co2 you can have too much water in

856
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:49,139
there one reason another your co2 is

857
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:51,409
going to be less pure you know there is

858
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:55,159
some truth to that

859
00:39:51,409 --> 00:40:00,319
but in practice I've noticed that

860
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:04,129
there's not much less ability to extract

861
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:11,510
from reused co2 as there is from fresh

862
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:14,769
co2 and you know co2 production it uses

863
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:18,560
fossil fuels it uses energy that we have

864
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:21,739
to create those bottles of co2 then

865
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:25,880
there's diesel in the trucks that are

866
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:29,059
used to ship that co2 around and deliver

867
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:33,140
it to your location so we're using

868
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:35,150
energy to deliver this and so I think

869
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:41,019
that the the best thing that we can do

870
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:44,240
is reuse everything that we can you know

871
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:45,440
it doesn't is there any degradation to

872
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,899
the product I mean you mentioned a

873
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,570
potential for water or at least the

874
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,610
suspicion of water in there reuse 'el

875
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,930
but but have you noticed any different

876
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,349
in your final products because you know

877
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:58,969
you run using recycled co2 all the time

878
00:40:56,349 --> 00:41:02,929
no you know I have it I mean I've used

879
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:05,149
just fresh and gone straight fresh co2

880
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:08,929
and I haven't noticed a yield difference

881
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:11,030
I haven't noticed anything different as

882
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:14,659
far as you know what the product is I

883
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:17,810
mean realistically there's very little

884
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:21,739
water that's going to make it into your

885
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:24,380
accumulator tank on a co2 system you

886
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:27,139
just you're not really gonna have much

887
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:30,320
there because most of the water is gonna

888
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:32,929
drop out and your separator you know

889
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:35,769
that the separator should be at a low

890
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:37,759
enough pressure or low enough

891
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:40,789
temperature that the water is not going

892
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,030
to boil right because you wouldn't want

893
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:48,110
that hot you know with your oil sitting

894
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:50,300
in there so so your oil and your water

895
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:54,710
from every run is going to be in your

896
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:57,590
separator and not it doesn't carry over

897
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:00,710
as a gas into the accumulator at least

898
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:02,570
not in a large part there there is some

899
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,949
carryover just like there's some

900
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:07,380
carryover of terpenes

901
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:09,960
and so you know you could say that that

902
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,269
there's going to be more terpenes that

903
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,139
that will collect in the accumulator as

904
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:19,889
well and so using it you're kind of

905
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:22,679
recycling those terpenes but yeah so you

906
00:42:19,889 --> 00:42:26,670
know I I just like to do everything as

907
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:29,849
green as possible and and be as little

908
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:32,280
of a burden on the earth as I can while

909
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:34,110
I'm producing the extracts that that I

910
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,269
want to produce so I got to tell you

911
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:38,309
that that hearing this as one of your

912
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:40,889
best practices is heartening but also

913
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:42,809
not you know not what I was expecting I

914
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:45,690
was expecting you to give me another you

915
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:48,630
know very technical thing but but it's

916
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:51,860
you know considering how bad our

917
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:54,900
industry is right now as far as you know

918
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:57,780
green footprint go or our co2 footprint

919
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,059
goes between you know making all the the

920
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:03,240
packaging and and and you know using

921
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:05,250
plastic for a one-gram Doug and and all

922
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:08,279
the lights that we need to use to grow

923
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:11,219
indoors I mean the fact that that we are

924
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,970
able to even take baby steps and to

925
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:18,029
start bringing you know green ideology

926
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:20,519
into the scene I think is overdue and a

927
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,220
good thing you know and one other thing

928
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:26,039
that we do some other companies do it

929
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:28,019
but most companies don't we sell a one

930
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,659
gram cartridge so in Washington state

931
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:33,090
were limited to one gram sales that's

932
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:37,920
the most extract that you're allowed to

933
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:40,370
sell in one package with all the wicking

934
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,220
cards or cartridges that were out there

935
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:46,319
one grams were horrible it was you know

936
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,119
you would have almost every time you

937
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,840
would have a leak by the time you got

938
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,059
through a gram of extract so the

939
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,250
majority of people went over to a half

940
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:58,170
gram cartridge because it was much more

941
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,349
reliable you were only going through a

942
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:04,349
half gram of oil you had less less

943
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:08,099
chance for that to leak and the profit

944
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:10,889
margin is a little bit better on selling

945
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:12,360
the half grams right you're able to you

946
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:14,250
know you're selling two units and you

947
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,620
have a little bit more markup on each

948
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,639
one so the majority of the industry has

949
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,788
gone to

950
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:22,710
half gram cartridges and we sell half

951
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:25,499
gram cartridges because that's what most

952
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:29,009
consumers want but we also sell gram

953
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:32,730
cartridges and really would prefer to

954
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:35,068
sell gram cartridges you know so that we

955
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,778
have less waste there's so much waste

956
00:44:35,068 --> 00:44:41,278
that goes into this product you know

957
00:44:36,778 --> 00:44:43,768
we've got to try every step to improve

958
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:45,960
what we're doing so that we have less

959
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:47,909
waste I got one more question for you

960
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,690
before we go to commercial and it's and

961
00:44:47,909 --> 00:44:54,028
it's on the same idea of

962
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:57,869
efficiencies of scale so you know you'll

963
00:44:54,028 --> 00:45:01,380
you'll get a half gram cart for X amount

964
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:04,890
of money and then you'll get a full gram

965
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:07,200
cart for you know usually slightly less

966
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:09,598
than double the price of the half gram

967
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,399
but then you know they call them

968
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,289
different names different places some

969
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,499
people call them tankers some of people

970
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:18,900
call them syringes essentially it's a

971
00:45:16,498 --> 00:45:21,509
it's a it's a packaging that is sold

972
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,210
with the assumption that you have your

973
00:45:21,509 --> 00:45:26,778
own empty cartridge at home that you're

974
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:31,170
gonna you know squeeze this syringe into

975
00:45:26,778 --> 00:45:33,690
yourself and and and tankers or syringes

976
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:35,190
tend to have a really nice price like

977
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:39,088
whenever given the option I will always

978
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:43,139
buy a syringe and refill my my my

979
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:46,528
Jupiter cartridges that fit my C cell at

980
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:50,068
home but honestly it doesn't seem like

981
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:52,650
it's all that much more hassle to put it

982
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:55,498
in a cartridge as it is in a syringe why

983
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:58,999
what's going on behind the scenes in the

984
00:45:55,498 --> 00:46:02,969
lab that explains why tankers or

985
00:45:58,998 --> 00:46:07,108
syringes are so much less than a 1 gram

986
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:11,669
part yes so so filling the filling cost

987
00:46:07,108 --> 00:46:15,538
is equal on a cartridge or a syringe

988
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:17,789
might even be just just a hair easier to

989
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:20,309
fill the syringe but I you know not

990
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:24,059
really it's it's it's almost equal

991
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:29,099
almost equal what's really going on is

992
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:31,090
the the price of the package so I mean

993
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:34,240
we we go with

994
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:35,700
with the best syringe that we could find

995
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,209
and that's an all-glass

996
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:43,619
syringe no Pyrex no I mean no plastic no

997
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:49,059
silicone plunger it is glass on glass

998
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:51,880
and the cost of that is way less than

999
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:55,299
the cost of either a full gram or a half

1000
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,309
gram cartridge okay so so it's it's

1001
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,769
really I mean we're selling the oil for

1002
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:04,239
the exact same price it's all the

1003
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:06,699
packaging that is changing what what the

1004
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,250
cost is to the end consumer right on

1005
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:10,960
cool and actually I actually way prefer

1006
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,449
getting the syringe not only because I

1007
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,550
like to use my own carts but you know I

1008
00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:17,679
have a hard time throwing those glass on

1009
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,289
glass syringes away cuz they're so nice

1010
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,759
you know I don't know what I'm gonna use

1011
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:31,869
them all for someday but I've got a

1012
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:34,750
bunch of them now so waiting for the

1013
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:37,539
application I think that's really the

1014
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:40,269
way the way to go and and you know I

1015
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:43,690
would really push anybody that's

1016
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:47,199
thinking of producing a high terpene

1017
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:50,740
content product get away from the

1018
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,809
plastic syringes you know don't even use

1019
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:56,169
something that has a silicone plunger

1020
00:47:52,809 --> 00:48:00,880
and a glass barrel go for the full glass

1021
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:04,630
on glass and it's it's that much better

1022
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,460
you know when you have a silicone

1023
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:09,910
plunger or you've got the plastic

1024
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,289
syringe you have terpenes in there that

1025
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:13,599
are going to be eating it

1026
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:17,500
you're good it's it's getting into your

1027
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:20,440
oil you know when you buy like a gram of

1028
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,329
distillate let's say and one of those

1029
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,730
things that has a silicone plunger in it

1030
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:26,650
by the time you plunge down towards the

1031
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:28,480
end of it you'll notice the the

1032
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:30,700
distillate that was clear at the

1033
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,400
beginning of the gram has now become

1034
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:36,639
cloudy and that's because of the

1035
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:39,130
lubricants that are used in in these

1036
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:44,348
syringes or tankers whatever you want to

1037
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:47,318
call them and because of it you know it

1038
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:51,099
yeah it's it's it's just the

1039
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:57,579
manufacturing things you know the the

1040
00:48:51,099 --> 00:49:01,809
the silicone lubricant set and terpenes

1041
00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:03,640
themselves are corrosive their solvents

1042
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:05,829
they they are you know they're alcohols

1043
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:09,848
so they're going to break they're gonna

1044
00:49:05,829 --> 00:49:14,140
break down anything that they can you

1045
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:19,059
know dissolve so there you have it so go

1046
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:21,848
with glass oh not just not just a glass

1047
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:24,278
you know tanker with a silicone plunger

1048
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:25,989
glass on glass so let's go ahead and

1049
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:27,369
take our second short break we'll be

1050
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:29,619
right back you're listening to shaping

1051
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:32,220
fire and my guest today is Jeff Wilhite

1052
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:34,539
director of extracts at puffin farm

1053
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,909
using pesticides when growing cannabis

1054
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:39,339
has been common for a long time nowadays

1055
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:41,469
though we know better we know that most

1056
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:42,998
pesticides formulated for food crops

1057
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:45,399
have never been tested for use with

1058
00:49:42,998 --> 00:49:47,709
cannabis they've been tested to be eaten

1059
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,660
in tiny doses they have not been tested

1060
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,778
to be inhaled and especially not

1061
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:54,159
concentrated into a cannabis oil

1062
00:49:51,778 --> 00:49:55,900
chemical residues from pesticides are

1063
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,420
not healthy for anyone but they are

1064
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,039
especially dangerous for patients for

1065
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,349
commercial cannabis growers this has

1066
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:04,089
become very impactful cannabis

1067
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:06,759
enthusiasts and patients have gotten

1068
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:09,699
educated enough that they avoid growers

1069
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:11,349
who used pesticides not only that but

1070
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:13,659
states across the country have begun

1071
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:17,200
making pesticide testing mandatory on

1072
00:50:13,659 --> 00:50:18,699
all licensed cannabis crops the time has

1073
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:20,798
come to find a better way to fight

1074
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:22,838
garden pests than covering your cannabis

1075
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:26,818
and chemicals and there is a better way

1076
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:29,170
let some good bugs fight your bad bugs

1077
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:30,969
beneficial insects and predatory mites

1078
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:33,249
have come a long way since we were

1079
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:35,200

understand the importance of living soil

1103
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:36,940
when growing cannabis when you have

active microbe communities in your

1121
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:15,400
but the microbes act as a defense shield

supplementing with microorganisms is

1138

1143
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:03,820
where you can buy namma pee near you

1144
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:07,029
check out their website at WWF microbes

1145
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:09,250
calm partner with microorganisms to

1146
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:11,440
create beautiful thriving cannabis

1147
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,858
mammoth pee welcome back you're

1148
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,019
listening

1149
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:15,699
shaping fire I'm your host Shango Laos

1150
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:19,179
and our guest this week is Jeff Wilhoit

1151
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:21,368
director of extracts at puffin farm so

1152
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:25,480
Jeff this next section I want to talk

1153
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:27,910
more about getting hands-on with the co2

1154
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,409
extractor itself because you know when

1155
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:30,998
we first met one of the first things you

1156
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:33,429
had told me is that you were you were

1157
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:34,838
modding yours and I'm that scared the

1158
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:36,879
hell out of me right I'm like you're

1159
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:38,949
taking this you know this 80 hundred

1160
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,048
thousand dollar machine and and you're

1161
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:43,298
gonna fix it somehow but I'm like dude

1162
00:53:41,048 --> 00:53:44,588
are you sure but but you know you've had

1163
00:53:43,298 --> 00:53:46,179
a lot of success with that and now

1164
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:48,219
you've mentioned some other things to me

1165
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:49,808
over the years that you've done so so

1166
00:53:48,219 --> 00:53:52,088
let's talk a little bit about modding

1167
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,920
machines so so if I remember correctly

1168
00:53:52,088 --> 00:53:55,960
let's let's start with your first mod I

1169
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,389
think it was a retrofit of some sort and

1170
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,269
if I remember correctly you owned an

1171
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:03,068
apex machine and you wanted it to do

1172
00:54:01,268 --> 00:54:04,778
something that it didn't do out of the

1173
00:54:03,068 --> 00:54:06,599
box so kind of break that out and

1174
00:54:04,778 --> 00:54:09,880
especially if it's still relevant today

1175
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:13,989
right so so okay so it's kind of funny

1176
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:19,028
you know apex was born out of Eden labs

1177
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:21,190
so auntie Joseph the the manufacturer of

1178
00:54:19,028 --> 00:54:25,179
Apex machines

1179
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:28,778
he was the welder for the high-pressure

1180
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:33,009
welder for Eden labs and so he was out

1181
00:54:28,778 --> 00:54:35,858
of Ohio Fritz the owner of Eden labs was

1182
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:38,498
from Ohio as well so that's that's how

1183
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:41,230
they knew each other and at some point

1184
00:54:38,498 --> 00:54:43,538
they had this falling out you know and

1185
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:47,739
and you know things things happen and he

1186
00:54:43,539 --> 00:54:50,528
decided to make his own machine and

1187
00:54:47,739 --> 00:54:53,619
started a company I I didn't purchase

1188
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:58,809
the apex machine but it landed in my

1189
00:54:53,619 --> 00:55:02,880
hands and and so we had this machine it

1190
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:07,869
was gas booster technology which was not

1191
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:12,130
you know the cutting edge it was kind of

1192
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:15,640
an old technology at that point and this

1193
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:18,068
machine that was built by Andy that kind

1194
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:20,108
of had everything good on paper he was

1195
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:23,288
good engineer but he didn't really

1196
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:25,569
understand cannabis extraction and what

1197
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:28,030
was gonna be happening while the

1198
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:30,550
traction was was actually happening so

1199
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:36,040
there were some things about the machine

1200
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:40,510
that didn't quite work very well so we

1201
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:45,309
would be running our runs and have our

1202
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:49,990
separators icing over because the the

1203
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:51,610
heater capacity wasn't wasn't enough we

1204
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:55,419
would have all kinds of different issues

1205
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:59,050
with the machine and no matter what we

1206
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:04,389
did we were not able to get a very high

1207
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:06,760
yield you know we were hitting 5% yields

1208
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:11,279
as kind of our highest highest that we

1209
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:15,370
could get this was a old 1500 psi

1210
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:18,280
machine and that was based on a lot of

1211
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:20,769
the technology in the machine itself not

1212
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:25,150
necessarily the extraction vessel the

1213
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:30,849
vessel was rated you know above 2,000

1214
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:34,059
psi and so we were talking with Eden

1215
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:36,549
labs because they're here in Seattle and

1216
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:38,739
Andy was all the way over in Ohio and we

1217
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:40,450
get you know one story from Andy but he

1218
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:42,939
didn't really know exactly too much

1219
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:47,039
about it in 2013 he didn't know too much

1220
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:51,369
about running the extractors to extract

1221
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:54,070
cannabinoids so we had had eaten labs

1222
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:56,339
here and they were happy enough to reach

1223
00:56:54,070 --> 00:57:00,580
out and help us any way that they could

1224
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:03,760
they lent us heat baths to try and

1225
00:57:00,579 --> 00:57:07,599
overcome the issue so where we would

1226
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:10,570
have you know our heater wasn't capable

1227
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,309
of producing enough heat to stop it from

1228
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:14,590
freezing over and so they would lend us

1229
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:15,759
heat baths and and finally it came to

1230
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:18,430
the point where we were like yeah you

1231
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:22,210
know what we really need to do is have

1232
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:24,519
an Eden high flow liquid system so it

1233
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:29,010
would be instead of a gas booster where

1234
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:32,019
gas is compressed by the pump into

1235
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:33,910
liquid and then that liquid is shot into

1236
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:38,079
the extraction vessel it would be a

1237
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:39,309
liquid pump where liquid was pumped from

1238
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,670
an accumulator

1239
00:57:39,309 --> 00:57:44,829
hang on the machine through the through

1240
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,869
the extraction vessel and then it would

1241
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:49,569
end up back as a liquid in the

1242
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:51,759
accumulator tank after it goes through

1243
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:54,730
the whole machine so kind of the way

1244
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,840
that the the machines were running were

1245
00:57:54,730 --> 00:58:05,559
way different the the liquid aspect

1246
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:08,170
allowed for a lot more a lot higher flow

1247
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:10,599
rate of co2 and since you know

1248
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:12,220
extraction is really based on flow rate

1249
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:16,000
it's how much solvent are you moving

1250
00:58:12,219 --> 00:58:18,539
over the material and how much time we

1251
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,869
just decided hey let's let's do this so

1252
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:26,230
we worked with Eden labs on designing a

1253
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:31,750
retrofit that was kind of custom to the

1254
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:34,960
machine that we had and got a secondary

1255
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:39,789
skid that sat right next to our machine

1256
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:45,730
that had a pump on it and we were able

1257
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:48,420
to double our extraction yield and cut

1258
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:52,599
down the time that it took to extract

1259
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:56,380
you know we were running up to 12 hours

1260
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:59,589
and getting only 5% on the apex 2013

1261
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:02,410
series machine and we were able to cut

1262
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:06,789
that down to 4 hours and and be able to

1263
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:11,529
reliably get 8 to 10% winterized oil out

1264
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:15,519
of it after we were done but yeah so so

1265
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:17,290
you know the retrofit it's it's really

1266
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,539
you know it's kind of this leap of faith

1267
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:21,699
that we took we said hey you know we

1268
00:59:19,539 --> 00:59:23,559
think that this other system is going to

1269
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:26,829
work better for us all of the numbers

1270
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:30,940
seem to to equate let's try it out

1271
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:33,279
so we we had them design it manufacture

1272
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:35,200
it and we tried it out and everything

1273
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,880
worked great so that doesn't that

1274
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:38,230
doesn't sound like a cheap mod though

1275
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,720
that sounds like that probably cost you

1276
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:44,710
a couple tens of thousands of dollars

1277
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:48,339
yeah it was expensive but doubling your

1278
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:51,639
yield and cutting your time by 60 per

1279
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:52,640
say t 70ish percent that sounds like a

1280
00:59:51,639 --> 00:59:55,129
great win though

1281
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:59,960
yeah yeah I think at the time it was

1282
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:05,090
like 36 grand to do it which compared to

1283
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:07,639
the price of a new 5 litre extractor at

1284
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:12,019
that point which was like I think they

1285
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:14,829
were like 86 or 90 thousand somewhere

1286
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:20,599
somewhere around that range at that time

1287
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:23,960
it was way cheap and they were nice they

1288
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:27,679
worked with us and helped us be able to

1289
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:29,059
make it happen right on that that's a

1290
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:32,269
great solution you know another thing I

1291
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:37,820
like about it too is it you're I'm

1292
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:40,699
always a fan of extractors not being

1293
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:45,500
afraid to get under the hood and and

1294
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:48,289
make some non stock changes to their

1295
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:49,610
gear good oh I was just gonna say

1296
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:51,079
because you know so often they're like

1297
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:53,630
well you know we won't we want to keep

1298
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:56,360
it just like the the it was sold to us

1299
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:58,730
but so often the the machines are sold

1300
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,980
kind of like at it as a mean like okay

1301
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:03,260
this is the kind of machine that people

1302
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:05,690
everybody generally needs but if your

1303
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,340
specialty is one thing or another you

1304
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,349
know you might as well hot rod it in

1305
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:12,019
that direction

1306
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:14,360
yeah you know these machines are built

1307
01:01:12,019 --> 01:01:18,769
with safety in mind there's pressure

1308
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:21,769
relief valves everywhere on the system

1309
01:01:18,769 --> 01:01:26,059
so if you do get into a situation where

1310
01:01:21,769 --> 01:01:28,759
there's an overpressure in any of any of

1311
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:31,099
the vessels it's gonna just blow it off

1312
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:33,560
and and you're gonna have to say oh what

1313
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:35,869
did I do you know what you know what

1314
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:38,719
caused this figure it out

1315
01:01:35,869 --> 01:01:42,589
fix it so you know there's really

1316
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:44,480
nothing to worry about as far as hurting

1317
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:46,820
yourself with one of these machines

1318
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:54,110
because they're just so they're built

1319
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:56,240
soberly you know yeah so and after that

1320
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,890
retrofit it really kind of opened us up

1321
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:00,739
to say hey look you can change

1322
01:01:57,889 --> 01:02:03,109
everything on this machine let's look at

1323
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:06,049
the flow path let's look at how things

1324
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,500
are going and try to come up with a

1325
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:12,100
better way

1326
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:14,599
extract so we actually started doing

1327
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:17,559
subcritical runs so the way that an

1328
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:22,360
Eaton Labs high flow machine is set up

1329
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:25,519
your basically it's set up to run a

1330
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:29,599
supercritical run if you modify it a

1331
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:32,239
little bit slow down the pump and put a

1332
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:36,309
chiller on the extraction vessel instead

1333
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:38,569
of a heat bath you can do a subcritical

1334
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:42,590
liquid extraction that's going to get

1335
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:48,500
you a much different constituent profile

1336
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:51,530
you know we've we extracted lots of

1337
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,750
subcritical runs and and really kind of

1338
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:59,690
came up with a product that's similar to

1339
01:02:53,750 --> 01:03:04,519
what we what we have today at Puffin you

1340
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:07,789
know really high terpene content extract

1341
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:10,969
that's that's free of lipids for the

1342
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:13,340
most part lipids are just like the

1343
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:15,859
cannabinoids that the higher pressures

1344
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:20,180
they're more extractable so if you're

1345
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:23,870
gonna extract it you know 1100 PSI say

1346
01:03:20,179 --> 01:03:26,539
for a subcritical run you're gonna have

1347
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:31,549
a much cleaner extract that needs much

1348
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:33,170
less post-processing and you know kind

1349
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:35,890
of the way to go now with with

1350
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:40,369
subcritical the disadvantage there is

1351
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:44,150
your yield is sacrificed so because it's

1352
01:03:40,369 --> 01:03:46,519
harder to extract those cannabinoids at

1353
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:49,940
those lower pressures you're not gonna

1354
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:51,860
get quite as much there but but yeah so

1355
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:55,849
you know I mean what we did put a

1356
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:59,150
subcritical mod we took a chiller and we

1357
01:03:55,849 --> 01:04:05,569
cut into the line where the heat bath

1358
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:08,059
was and put in a three-way valve in

1359
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:12,500
there where we could select either the

1360
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:14,690
heat bath or the chiller and kind of hot

1361
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:17,630
swap it so we'd be able to do like a

1362
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:20,829
cold subcritical run get this really

1363
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:23,660
chirpy extract and then

1364
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:26,719
then do a supercritical run after that

1365
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:28,339
kind of swap that over and you start

1366
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:30,589
pumping the heat bath in there and

1367
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:34,789
you're able to get more of a cannabinoid

1368
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:36,440
rich secondary cut that then you could

1369
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:39,320
winterize and then you could put those

1370
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,179
oils back together that first

1371
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:45,559
subcritical run that you haven't

1372
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:47,179
winterized and the the final would

1373
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:50,659
driest extract from the supercritical

1374
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:52,969
run so kind of you know just just trying

1375
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:57,170
to go different ways about it

1376
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:59,539
and good idea actually of running at two

1377
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:01,670
different ways for two different types

1378
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:03,409
of benefits but then putting together at

1379
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:06,440
the end to make something that's better

1380
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:09,019
than the some of both yeah yeah

1381
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:11,119
definitely so we hit and we've hit two

1382
01:05:09,019 --> 01:05:13,130
mods we hit the retrofit mod and the

1383
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,929
subcritical mod do do you have one more

1384
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:18,890
that you might find interesting

1385
01:05:14,929 --> 01:05:21,079
yeah so so you know really my favorite

1386
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:29,719
one and the one that I need to do myself

1387
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:32,809
right now and so if you buy an Eden lab

1388
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:34,579
system it comes with two heat baths one

1389
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:37,849
for the extractor one for the separator

1390
01:05:34,579 --> 01:05:41,869
and so simply getting a PID controller

1391
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:46,130
which is what you know your email uses

1392
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:47,509
to you know keep your it reads a

1393
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:50,990
thermocouple which is a thermometer

1394
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:53,630
basically and has a heating element

1395
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:56,479
attached to it so it kind of cycles on

1396
01:05:53,630 --> 01:06:00,740
and off to keep your email hot same

1397
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:03,170
thing on a heat bath and what that

1398
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:07,849
allows you to do is is have just this

1399
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:10,309
ultra stable temperature so you're not

1400
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:14,480
having drift when we were working down

1401
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:17,480
in SoDo just where we were on the power

1402
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,490
grid there were fluctuations in the

1403
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:22,429
quality of the power that was being

1404
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:24,529
delivered you know I don't know if it

1405
01:06:22,429 --> 01:06:27,739
was just we were near the end of the

1406
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:30,500
line there's some really really heavy

1407
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:33,769
power consumers down there in the

1408
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:43,190
industrial district in Seattle and so we

1409
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:45,980
would notice a variance of quite 10 10

1410
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:48,139
degree up to 20 degree shift in

1411
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:50,210
temperature of our heat bath where it's

1412
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:52,309
you know it's at the same setting but

1413
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:54,440
because of the quality of the power that

1414
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:56,599
was coming into the building we would

1415
01:06:54,440 --> 01:07:02,000
have this fluctuation between you know

1416
01:06:56,599 --> 01:07:04,569
the morning and the evening and so we we

1417
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,110
just drilled a hole into the heat bath

1418
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:10,640
put a thermocouple in there that had a

1419
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:12,860
gasket fitting on it so you know the

1420
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:15,730
heat bath wouldn't leak hook that

1421
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:21,980
thermocouple up to the PID controller

1422
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:27,139
and then had the PID controller it had a

1423
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:31,460
relay that switched on and off a the

1424
01:07:27,139 --> 01:07:33,769
outlet that the heat bath is plugged

1425
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:37,490
into so basically turn the heat bath on

1426
01:07:33,769 --> 01:07:39,769
it's analog dial all the way up and then

1427
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:41,750
you set the PID controller for the

1428
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:46,219
temperature that you want and it would

1429
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:48,110
cycle on and off the power.keeping your

1430
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:50,989
heat bath at the desired temperature

1431
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:53,269
rather than running into this you know

1432
01:07:50,989 --> 01:07:57,679
issue of the quality of the power

1433
01:07:53,269 --> 01:08:00,980
changing it and even you know I I

1434
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:03,919
noticed some fluctuation during the day

1435
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:06,079
you know if it's if it heats up outside

1436
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,059
you know if you've got a ambient

1437
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:10,909
temperature fluctuation you're gonna

1438
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:14,059
have a fluctuation and what your heat

1439
01:08:10,909 --> 01:08:17,149
bath is is is getting so you know to

1440
01:08:14,059 --> 01:08:19,850
have a stable repeatable temperature

1441
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:22,099
that you're extracting at a heat bath

1442
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:24,410
mod is really the way to go

1443
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:26,480
yeah the idea of keeping it at one

1444
01:08:24,409 --> 01:08:28,068
temperature you know it's not just for

1445
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:32,239
convenience we're doing science here

1446
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:33,859
people yeah it's it's it's because it's

1447
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:36,139
gonna extract exactly the same

1448
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:38,240
constituents of that temperature and if

1449
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:40,100
it if it fluctuates it's getting

1450
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:42,229
something different right on right on

1451
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:44,690
well Jeff thank you so much for taking

1452
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:46,219
some time to join us again on the show I

1453
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:47,929
always love chatting with you and

1454
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:50,960
you know honestly you know with a lot of

1455
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:52,820
my other shows I've got a very stringent

1456
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,380
set of questions that I'm gonna walk

1457
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:56,899
somebody through but one of things I

1458
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,789
enjoy about you is that I don't actually

1459
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:02,029
always know where we're gonna go because

1460
01:08:58,789 --> 01:09:05,060

with you about all things cannabis I

1470
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:26,449
just I love to talk about cannabis

1471
01:09:24,189 --> 01:09:29,539
anytime right on cool man

1472
01:09:26,449 --> 01:09:31,699
so if you want to follow Jeff on his

1473
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:34,989
Instagram it is a great place to follow

1474
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:37,519
along and that's at cannabis Reverend on

1475
01:09:34,989 --> 01:09:38,899
Instagram we've also got a video that's

1476
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,850
going to be coming out here in a couple

1477
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:42,710
weeks where I'm gonna be working through

1478
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:46,910
with Jeff or he'll be explaining to me

1479
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:49,579
rather the the genesis of the hash star

1480
01:09:46,909 --> 01:09:51,229
rating system because he was there in

1481
01:09:49,579 --> 01:09:52,340
the early days when it came about and so

1482
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:54,859
we're gonna talk about that a little bit

1483
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:56,569
you'll find that on the youtube channel

1484
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:58,729
and actually you really should go over

1485
01:09:56,569 --> 01:10:02,199
to the YouTube channel and hear and

1486
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:04,459
actually watch a couple of Jeff's

1487
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:07,880
presentations made here on Vashon Island

1488
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:11,659
where I live for patients he does he did

1489
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:14,840
a one presentation on doing making

1490
01:10:11,659 --> 01:10:17,960
bubble hash at home for patients and

1491
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,470
then a second one on making ethanol hash

1492
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,250
oil

1493
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:23,659
aka RSO for patients as well and so so

1494
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:25,100
if you're a commercial producer these

1495
01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:27,430
are probably not going to be the videos

1496
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:31,250
you want because he's focusing more on

1497
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:32,510
using limited materials and ease well

1498
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:34,880
it's not really a you know necessarily

1499
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:36,860
scalable but but if you're a patient and

1500
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,050
you're looking for a simple way to get

1501
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:41,359
