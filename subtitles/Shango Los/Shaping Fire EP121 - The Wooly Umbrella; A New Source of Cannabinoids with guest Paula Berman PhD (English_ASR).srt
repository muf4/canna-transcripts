2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,719
I think it is fair to say that most

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:16,160
people who enjoy cannabis do so because

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:18,000
of the THC in cannabis. That said, I

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,920
know plenty of people who are focused on

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,399
the other canabonoids for either health

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,199
or commerce reasons. Plenty of people

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:28,159
obtain their relief through CBD or CBG

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,320
or CBN or the other novel canabonoids

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,799
and next generation products like

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,119
beverages infused with these canabonoids

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,879
have become a huge hit in the market.

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,759
But many of these companies are held

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,200
back because those other canabonoids are

15
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:46,640
associated too directly with the wrongly

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,960
persecuted THC molecule. Hemp has been

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,920
one way to try and take a half step away

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,719
from full THC plants in order to gain

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,280
access to the other canabonoids. But now

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,239
many states, including California, have

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,760
made canabonoids from hemp even

22
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,599
disallowed. For example, I used to love

23
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,599
Creek River Botanical Hops and

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,760
canabonoid beverages, but I can't find

25
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,879
their products anywhere now due to the

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,799
change in California law interpretation.

27
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,359
While it was foolish from the beginning

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,159
to prohibit the cannabis plant at all,

29
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,799
prohibiting access to the non-THC

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,920
canabonoids is even worse. It's like

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,439
dumb stacked upon ignorance. It sure

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
would be great if we could get

33
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,478
canabonoids from a secondary plant that

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
doesn't have THC in it at all, wouldn't

35
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,599
it? If you want to learn about cannabis

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,438

59
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:25,039
Welcome to episode 121. My guest today

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,879
is Dr. Paula Berman. Dr. Berman earned

61
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,519
her bachelor's in biotechnology

62
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,079
engineering and her master's and PhD in

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,640
environmental engineering from Bengurian

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,800
University. Throughout her studies, she

65
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,238
worked in the plant lipid biotechnology

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,000
lab under Professor Za Vman, focusing on

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,878
the chemistry of vegetable oils and

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,318
their applications in biodeiesel

69
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,560
production. She completed her first

70
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,359
postdoctoral fellowship in the cancer

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,239
biology and canabonoid research lab at

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,120
the Technon's faculty of biology led by

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,280
professor Diddy Mary. As the lab's lead

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,599
analytical chemist, she developed mass

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,120
spectrometry methods to identify over a

76
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,280
100 canabonoids in cannabis as well as

77
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,280
endockinabonoids and related

78
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,239
compounds. Paula then joined the lab of

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,840
professor Esaf Aheroni at the plant

80
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,000
science department at the vitzman

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,400
institute where she completed a second

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,120
posttock and now serves as a research

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,519
associate. Her research focuses on the

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,239
biosynthetic pathways of canabonoids and

85
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,480
psychedelics with therapeutic potential.

86
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,719
This coming summer, Paula will establish

87
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,479
her own research lab at the Volcani

88
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,719
Agricultural Center, where she will

89
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,280
continue investigating medicinal plants

90
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,158
and their specialized metabolites. This

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
is truly impressive work. Today, we're

92
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,318
going to learn about the woolly umbrella

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,879
plant, uh, better known in the lab as

94
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,079
the heli. We conducted today's interview

95
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:49,840
halfway around the world from each

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
other. So there are a few echoes and

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,080
minor drops today, but nothing annoying.

98
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,639
During the first set, we will discuss

99
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,200
the botanical attributes, distribution,

100
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,039
and uses for the heli plant. In the

101
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,119
second set, we dig into the various

102
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,280
canabonoids, extraction methods, and

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,280
applications. And we finish the episode

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,438
with a short discussion about the future

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,080
of this amazing plant, both commercially

106
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:15,280
and scientifically. Welcome to Shaping

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,199
Fire, Dr. Berman. Hello, Shango. It's a

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
pleasure to be here. Thank you so much

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,000
for taking time uh especially since we

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,639
are so far separated in the world today

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,879
to be up uh late uh talking to me and

112
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,439
early here. I I appreciate you making a

113
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,319
special time for us. It's my pleasure.

114
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,639
Thank you for this invitation. So let's

115
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,360
start off with the simple basics with uh

116
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,400
the woolly umbrella plant. It has a

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,919
complex to me scientific name. I tried

118
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,918
to say it a bunch of times in

119
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,478
preparation for our interview today and

120
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,478
and each time I said it different. So

121
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,319
instead of me embarrassing myself, let

122
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,918
us please start. Would you say the

123
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,839
scientific name for us so that we can

124
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:58,240
all learn it together? Uh so the name is

125
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,959
Elryum Umbraum.

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,199
Thank you. That is a mouthful.

127
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,239
It's also tough for us. Yeah, I believe

128
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,240
it. Um so Woolly Umbrella is the common

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,199
name that I have most come across. Is

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,720
that your preferred common name as well?

131
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,120
Uh, so actually in the lab we call the

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
plant Heli as a nickname. Oh, that's

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,680
cool. Heli from the from the from the

134
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,000
from its proper Latin name. Great. Um,

135
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,240
and so great. So I'll probably go back

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,600
and forth between heli and woolly just

137
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,680
so I can feel scientific. Um, so so let

138
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,000
let's start with um the distribution of

139
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,680
the heli. where where is the heli plant

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,519
found and what are its basic

141
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,879
characteristics?

142
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,319
Uh so it's the the origin is in South

143
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:47,759
Africa in the eastern part of South

144
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:51,478
Africa. H it's a it's a a perennial

145
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:56,479
herb. H it grows all year round. H it

146
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:58,879
flowers around January to April. Um it's

147
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:04,120
an ornamental plant in South Africa. It

148
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:08,800
grows wild. H it has um um silver hairy

149
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,280
leaves and with beautiful um bright

150
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,280
yellow flowers that look like umbrellas

151
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,198
and that's where the name of the plant

152
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,359
comes from.

153
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,000
The um you said that it's used for

154
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,400
ornamental purposes primarily. Does it

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,240
have a reputation as a medicinal plant

156
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:28,719
at all or or was this um a surprise to

157
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,120
find medicinal properties in this plant?

158
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:36,160
H so a lot of helicry plants h from

159
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,720
South Africa have a medicinal

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:44,319
um erh purposes um it's known to be

161
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,319
burnt in rituals in cleansing rituals to

162
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,720
h connect to ancestors to provide

163
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,840
spiritual guidance and induce

164
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,440
transes the zulu tribes use a lot of

165
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,478
elicryome species as part of their

166
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:02,000
traditional medicine h but to be honest

167
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:05,318
We couldn't find exact proof whether

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,199
this specific helicryome plant helip

169
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:12,960
plant has medicinal purposes. I mean I

170
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,319
we know now about many of the molecules

171
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,839
that the plant biosynthesize the plant

172
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,080
the molecules that the plant

173
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:25,598
accumulates. But we cannot say for sure

174
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:28,680
what are the exact medicinal purposes.

175
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:33,839
We found a study for example that found

176
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,840
that extracts from the ryzen

177
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:41,360
plant have a gaba receptor binding

178
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,840
effect which h possibly have anxolytic

179
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,759
effects anti-epileptic or can be used

180
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:50,758
for insomnia and there are also a lot of

181
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,360
other molecules that have many different

182
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,038
bioactivities. Um, but the really

183
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,919
interesting thing about this plant is

184
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,918
that it's really

185
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:01,758
been overlooked over the years. It's not

186
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,399
been studied and there's there is very

187
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,000
little information about it. Well, uh,

188
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,439
that's fun cuz that way you get to

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
explore all the parts of it that you

190
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,120
want to. You don't have to go just for

191
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,840
the pockets of lacking research. That's

192
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,240
great to be the the first to a plant.

193
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,839
Where where on the plant do the

194
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,199
canabonoids

195
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,799
um uh appear? Are they expressed? Um, as

196
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,439
you know, our, you know, the show that

197
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
we're on shaping fire, we are mostly

198
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,360
focused on the cannabis plant, but

199
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,919
really canabonoid medicine in general,

200
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,479
which is how I found my way to you. And

201
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,559
in cannabis, the the canabonoids are

202
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,278
grown in the reinous flowers. Where are

203
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,359
they grown? Um, in the heli plant. So,

204
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:44,639
in the heli plant, we found canabonoids

205
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,800
in all the aerial parts of the plant h

206
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:52,000
besides roots. Um so basically any type

207
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,759
of tissue that contained a glandular

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,440
tricom. So similar in cannabis in

209
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,278
cannabis you have so in fluorosences of

210
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,600
cannabis are the most abundant in

211
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,480
glandular tricoms and this is where

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,720
these the canopinoids are biosynthesized

213
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,080
and where they accumulate. So similarly

214
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,920
we found it also in the helip plant h

215
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,839
they are biosynthesized and they

216
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,399
accumulate to these glandular tricoms

217
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,800
and these are most abundant in leaves

218
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,600
actually h we found them also very

219
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,919
abundant in flowers but h most

220
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,720
interesting and the highest potential

221
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,599
for us is h the fact that they

222
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,360
accumulate the most in leaves since they

223
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,120
are in tricoms uh glandular tricoms in

224
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
the heli plant just like they are in

225
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,759
cannabis this when you rub the plant

226
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,320
with your finger will you burst tricoms

227
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:45,519
and get the smell of the aroma of the

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,080
plant? Uh so you do I mean it's it's

229
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,480
quite different than in

230
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,600
cannabis. You have a very light aroma

231
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,200
very nice aroma like a perfume h from

232
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,920
the leaves and when you rub them you

233
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,519
have this reinous material on your

234
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,599
fingers. Definitely. Oh cool. So, so you

235
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,919
spearheaded this comprehensive study

236
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,480
that unveiled the plant's rather unique

237
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,479
ability to produce canabonoids. I'm I'm

238
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,039
really interested in what I guess I'll

239
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,200
call the ignition point of this idea.

240
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,919
So, you know, finding canabonoids in

241
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,920
plants is so atypical, I think, that it

242
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,159
wouldn't be the first thing that I would

243
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,399
look for. Um, it begs the question,

244
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,759
which came first? Did you did you go to

245
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,919
this plant looking for canabonoids or

246
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,319
somehow did you come across them

247
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,399
accidentally in the lab and then you

248
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,278
explored what you found? Which which

249
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,600
came first when deciding to go into um

250
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,759
working with this heli plant? So

251
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,360
actually we were not the first ones that

252
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,000
found that the plant produces

253
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,000
cannabonoids. H there is a German paper

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,919
from

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,720
1979 H that found that the plant

256
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:57,639
produces large amounts of CBGA

257
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,560
um um along with other

258
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:05,240
molecules a more protein types molecules

259
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:08,239
and some other types um but

260
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,079
um despite the fact that h the plant

261
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,399
that that it was shown that the plant

262
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,319
produces canabonoids this plant was very

263
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
largely overlooked

264
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,480
There were no additional studies looking

265
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
into the

266
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,000
phytochemistry, no genome, no

267
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,879
transcriptto, no biological information

268
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,278
whatsoever on the plant. Um, there was

269
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:31,679
another study from 2018 led by professor

270
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,879
Totes Capati and Professor Giovanni

271
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,120
Aendino which is a very known expert in

272
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,838
natural product chemistry group from

273
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,000
Italy. And they were also trying to

274
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,720
confirm that the the plant that hel

275
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,200
produces h cannabonoids and to find what

276
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,200
other cannabonoids it produces. And to

277
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,959
their surprise and to our surprise h

278
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,440
they couldn't find any ail canabonoids.

279
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:59,119
H only cannabonoid like molecules

280
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,200
molecules that have a very similar um

281
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,240
chemical structure like cannabonoids but

282
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,800
instead of alkal chains which we find in

283
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,639
cannabonoids h they have an aromatic

284
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:12,719
moty. So in this other study from 2018

285
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,480
they also couldn't find any canabinoids.

286
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,240
So when we started this study

287
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,159
h basically our first question was does

288
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,799
the plant produce cannaboids or not? It

289
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:28,480
wasn't uh we it wasn't confirmed and so

290
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:31,759
this was our starting point. Um so what

291
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,200
methods did you use to analyze the plant

292
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,278
for canabonoids? What did you do

293
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,320
differently that um caused you to find

294
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,759
them? So I I don't think that h I mean

295
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,600
we used the same methods as the

296
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,838
other group did and I will just talk

297
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,839
about them very briefly. I think that

298
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,399
the difference was that perhaps they

299
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,839
were using a different chemovar that in

300
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,720
their chemovar so like you have in

301
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,600
cannabis high THC high CBD high CBG and

302
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,720
so on types of chemovar. So perhaps they

303
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:05,278
were analyzing a chemov that doesn't

304
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,879
have cannabonoids. Um but actually it

305
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,919
was for us it was the quite immediate uh

306
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,838
that we identified that the plant has a

307
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,159
very large amounts of CBGA and the way

308
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:22,680
that we did it is using a

309
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:25,759
LCMS HLC which is connected to a mass

310
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:27,838
spectrometer it's so it's a method it's

311
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:32,399
an analytical chemistry method that

312
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:35,680
allows us to take very complex um

313
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,879
samples and to be able to identify the

314
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:43,359
specific compounds that are present in

315
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:47,439
our samples. Um so this was the the

316
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,399
basic uh um method or instrument that we

317
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,320
use for the identification. Uh but we

318
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,000
also use some other techniques. So for

319
00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:00,160
example um uh we use the fact that we

320
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,240
were growing the plant. So we we h use a

321
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,719
feeding of isotopically labeled

322
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,120
molecules. So these are molecules that

323
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,120
have isotopic labeled specific carbons

324
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:14,320
or hydrogens that are labeled in the

325
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,360
molecule that are more that are heavier

326
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,720
than than the other atoms that are in

327
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:25,199
the molecule. And then um we dip leaves

328
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,519
into solutions that contain these um um

329
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,719
these molecules, these labeled molecules

330
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,839
and we basically feed the leaves h with

331
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,320
the labelled compounds and then

332
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,160
following several days of feeding h we

333
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,600
can see whether the plant uses these

334
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:44,958
molecules they incorporate them in the

335
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,040
biosynthesis using LCMS. So basically we

336
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:50,159
can

337
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:54,240
um test whether a a specific molecule a

338
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:56,360
precursor is taken by a the specific

339
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,799
enzymes in the plant to produce the

340
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,440
molecules cannabonoids in in this

341
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,519
instance. So, so we also used this

342
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,600
feeding of isotopically labeled

343
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,600
molecules and using LCMS uh we could

344
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,079
identify which of the molecules were

345
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,320
labeled by um

346
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:18,319
specific specific atoms. Um we also

347
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,680
purified specific molecules and then

348
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,079
structural lucidated them using

349
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:26,799
NMR. And we use a really cool technique

350
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,719
uh to do localization of molecules to

351
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,359
find where these molecules are

352
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,399
specifically localized in the tissues.

353
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,879
It's a it's a a method that is called

354
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,839
multi imaging mass spectrometry imaging

355
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:43,120
where we do masspec h we acquire a

356
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:47,199
spectrum for each h pixel in our sample.

357
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,519
So we can show specifically what is the

358
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,359
location the localization of specific

359
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,440
canabonoids or any other molecule that

360
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,278
is in the sample. That's like what a

361
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,399
helpful tool. I can I can imagine um the

362
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:04,120
the cheer that went through the lab on

363
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,559
the on the day that you found

364
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,000
canabonoids in your first attempt. you

365
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,958
know there there there are the you know

366
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,078
these rumors and and perhaps CBGA and

367
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,479
and and and suddenly your lab uh you

368
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,719
know digs into it and suddenly boom

369
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,680
there they are. I can imagine that that

370
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:26,000
was a huge encouragement for everybody

371
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:28,159
on the team. Yes, you are correct.

372
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,399
So So these canabonoids that we're

373
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,879
finding in the heli plant are are these

374
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,278
identical to those found in cannabis? I

375
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,958
I I'm assuming that they are the same

376
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,759
molecule just occurring in a different

377
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,919
place. Is that accurate? H So some of

378
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,680
them are similar and others were

379
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:48,879
different. So um we found around 40

380
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,359
identified around 40 cannabonoids in the

381
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:54,559
heli

382
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:57,759
plant. No THCA, no CBDA. We found

383
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:00,399
different types of CBGA canabonoids with

384
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,560
different alkal chains. We found small

385
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,439
amounts of

386
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:08,000
CBCA and

387
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:10,160
the m most of the other types of

388
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,160
cannabonoids were completely new novel

389
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
cannabonoids that are not present or

390
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,360
have not been identified in cannabis. Oh

391
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,038
my gosh, how exciting. Uh do do I I know

392
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,519
I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but do

393
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,000
we know if those new canabonoids

394
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,679
interact with the human endockinabonoid

395
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,679
system yet or we is it too early to

396
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,360
know?

397
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,440
So, unfortunately, we haven't tested

398
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,399
them yet. I think that this is one of

399
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,720
the first things that uh we would really

400
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,640
really like to do. I bet it's so

401
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,480
exciting.

402
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:46,480
Um but uh we are pretty sure that they

403
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,319
also have other bioactivities and they

404
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,880
that they bind to different receptors.

405
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:54,480
So in this paper by um

406
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,280
professor Tetellas Kafati and professor

407
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,160
Giovanni Pendino H they tested some of

408
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:06,000
the molecules that they found in uh the

409
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:10,960
helip uh for binding affinities to h TRP

410
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,079
channels and to h CB-1 CB2 and and some

411
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,079
other ones. So even um some of more

412
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,399
fruin types can carabinoids that they

413
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:22,159
found the ones that have the aromatic

414
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,720
mighty instead of the alkal chain h some

415
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,160
of them also show the h

416
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,600
potential so we are pretty sure that

417
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,320
these will be

418
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:36,639
um expanding the repertoire of

419
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,599
modulators of the endocanabinoid system

420
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,120
but unfortunately they still await

421
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:45,759
testing. Sure. Sure, I understand. Um,

422
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:49,038
so I I assume that you are able to

423
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:53,200
isolate these canabonoids in the lab.

424
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:56,640
Um, as somebody who studies uh plant

425
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,319
medicine preparations in the home by

426
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,720
citizen scientists, if you will, um, uh,

427
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,960
other than extracting the canabonoids

428
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,720
from the plant in the lab, can this

429
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,000
plant be smoked whole as it is as well

430
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,319
or um, are there other uh, chemicals in

431
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,038
the plant that make it unattractive to

432
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,558
be smoked in in other traditional ways?

433
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,359
You mentioned, you know, some of the

434
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:24,160
heli plants were were burnt into smudge

435
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,798
pots and such traditionally, but I we I

436
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:32,240
don't know about this particular plant.

437
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:35,359
Um, so um I I don't know. I can't give

438
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,440
you like I I don't know exactly because

439
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:41,519
we've never tested it. Um there is since

440
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,880
there is so little information about it,

441
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:48,720
I would say that first someone needs to

442
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,520
test the toxicity. H we found that there

443
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,200
that there is no mutagenicity. H we

444
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,759
found a paper that looked into the

445
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,640
mutagenicity and there is none for this

446
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,359
extract. But I I think that it should be

447
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,520
tested for safety before I can recommend

448
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:08,000
people to start smoking it. Um

449
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,079
sure. And and even if you said that um

450
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,079
we we would never recommend that anybody

451
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,319
smoke it here. So I'm we we don't

452
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,159
definitely don't recommend that. But um

453
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,159
I figured if there was any reason that

454
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,120
you were like, "Oh yeah, like like this

455
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,640
plant also has got a natural biotoxin in

456
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,519
it." I figured I'd want to get that out

457
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,480
right away. So

458
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,240
um also the plant doesn't have THCA, so

459
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,519
you would probably don't will not have

460
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,240
the same effect as in cannabis. Sure.

461
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,918
But the, you know, the the the CBGA

462
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,079
certainly got a lot of attention be

463
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,840
because so many people in the states

464
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:46,480
have a hard time finding um CBG other

465
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:50,000
than in isolate, which I recognize

466
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,038
isolate is more popular for um you know,

467
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,279
the the pharmaceutical pursuit, but um

468
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:59,119
folks look for cannabis that is high in

469
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,038
CBG, at least here in the States, for

470
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,959
its you know, for its other medicinal

471
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:06,798
uses. And so that's that's the direction

472
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,798
I was coming from. Does the plant have

473
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:13,918
um a how do I want to say this? Are

474
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:16,240
there a lot of canabonoids in each plant

475
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,440
like the the potency if you will of each

476
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,000
plant? Is it very high or or is the is

477
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,960
the amount of u the volume of

478
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,599
canabonoids in the plant uh lower where

479
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,000
where um compared to say cannabis? Uh so

480
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,480
when we measured uh concentrations

481
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,279
absolute concentrations of cannabonoids

482
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,000
um we found that the leaves that are the

483
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:45,918
most abundant as I mentioned before h it

484
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,480
has around 4% of uh CBGA per dry weight

485
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,600
which is a lot much more than you can

486
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,839
find in most cannabis chemovers that are

487
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:58,798
not high CBG. So I know that now there

488
00:21:53,839 --> 00:22:00,639
are these high CBG uh strains uh that

489
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,558
for sure have a much higher

490
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,960
concentrations uh but for CBGAS uh quite

491
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,480
a lot. Yeah, for sure. That's

492
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,319
impressive. It's good. That's exactly

493
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,360
what I was hoping to find out. That's

494
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:16,678
that's a good news source. Um, so you

495
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:19,199
know, for cannabis and canabonoid

496
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,360
enthusiasts like we here at Shaping

497
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,480
Fire, your discovery is very important

498
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,719
and exciting, but I'm curious what the

499
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,279
response was from the scientific

500
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,600
community and separately the

501
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:35,839
pharmaceutical product community to your

502
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:38,158
research. um you know uh we want to hear

503
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,000
that you were celebrated and you have

504
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,720
attracted all of this new research

505
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,558
grants and and and that and that you

506
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,079
know this plant has become a celebrity

507
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,079
but that's not always the case and and

508
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,519
and I don't know the answer so so what

509
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,480
was the response from the science

510
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:55,759
community and the and the pharmaceutical

511
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,599
community h so actually the responses

512
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:03,558
were very enthusiastic good we got very

513
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:06,639
amazing responses Um I think that the

514
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:09,279
the biggest achievements that we made

515
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,080
the biggest advance advancements uh to

516
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,960
the field in this uh study h was first

517
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,960
of all the very comprehensive chemistry

518
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,279
that

519
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,440
we elucidated h the fact that we

520
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,399
provided another genome and transcryto

521
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,840
of a plant that produces cannabonoids.

522
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,360
um the enzymes that we identified uh

523
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,199
that you can use in etrology systems to

524
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:37,839
produce cannabonoids outside of the

525
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:40,480
plant. uh which by until this point were

526
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,839
only known from uh cannabis and now we

527
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:49,120
contributed to new enzymes that h can

528
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:51,519
contribute both to the to um the the

529
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:56,239
same types of cannabonoids but also to

530
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:59,119
produce h new types of cannabonoids h um

531
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,240
that were never been tested or are not

532
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,879
known h including new nature types of

533
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,029
cannabonoids

534
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,200
Um also it was very

535
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:12,158
[Music]

536
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,038
um the fact that we shed light uh to the

537
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,278
um evolution or we suggest about the

538
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,359
evolution of the biosynthetic pathway of

539
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:22,240
canaboninoids to have another plant that

540
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:25,278
produces the same types of molecules as

541
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,960
plant scientists. H it was very excited

542
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:31,679
and we got really good responses. H we

543
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,480
think that uh and we heard that it opens

544
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,720
uh new frontiers or avenues for

545
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,480
uh new as new modulators, new molecules

546
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,159
that can modulate the endocanabinoid

547
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,839
system and I believe that it has a whole

548
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,278
new type of entry effect.

549
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,119
This is great.

550
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,000
So we've mentioned the fact that the

551
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,558
plant produces cannabonoids but besides

552
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,240
cannabonoids h there are also other

553
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:03,278
types of meurpoids or tarpenols that are

554
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:08,079
also produced in very high quantities

555
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:11,119
along with h the canabonoids and h these

556
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:14,079
also have some of them have already

557
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:18,519
bioactivities that are known h ones that

558
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:23,038
h we elucidated which are completely new

559
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:26,639
Um so I think that overall uh this was

560
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:30,640
very exciting and the response from uh

561
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:33,120
uh all around was very exciting very

562
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,200
encouraging. Oh well congratulations and

563
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,119
and and I know that um you know this is

564
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,360
a pretty obscure topic for a lot of

565
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,759
people. I'm sure that when you go to you

566
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,759
know a cocktail party or something this

567
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,359
is lost on a lot of people but talking

568
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:50,079
with us we we're we are your supporters.

569
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,240
we're we're your fan base and and I and

570
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,319
and you know for us this feels like you

571
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,640
know a high five big celebration.

572
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,879
There's so much new potential you know

573
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,559
healing potential and science potential

574
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,000
and an entourage effect potential. Um I

575
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,240
mean there's there are lifetimes of

576
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,278
research here. So so we're we're all

577
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,240
excited with you. So congratulations.

578
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:14,480
So, so this plant, does does finding

579
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:20,839
this plant suggest that there might be

580
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:25,038
other plants um within the the heli um

581
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:29,439
um family isn't accurate, but um a genus

582
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:32,158
that um that might also be providing um

583
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,038
canabonoids or do we feel like we we

584
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,640
found the one within the genus?

585
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:42,319
Um

586
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,360
so as a plant scientist I think h that

587
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:48,960
or I expect that there

588
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:51,599
are hidden treasures that we haven't

589
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,679
elucidated yet. I think that nature is

590
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:58,240
amazing and h it's the the diversity is

591
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,679
so large that we there are still so many

592
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,880
plants that remain unexplored. Um I

593
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,278
would like to also mention that there

594
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,880
are also other plants that uh produce

595
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:11,679
cannabonoids or canominoid like

596
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,799
molecules. There's a rodendum doricum h

597
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,360
a plant it's not helicryome genus. It's

598
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,158
a different plant but it produces the

599
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:22,479
canabinoids. I mean it's also alkal

600
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,760
types canabonoids but they are quite

601
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,200
different. They are um CBCA type

602
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:33,200
cannaboninoid h but also produces them

603
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,558
in very large amounts. H also some other

604
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,440
um cannaboninoid like molecules h that

605
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:42,240
are called the

606
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,400
morphins. So I am if if these have all

607
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,159
been identified I am pretty sure that we

608
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,559
will hear also about some other uh new

609
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,240
plants. Fantastic. We're going to take a

610
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,158
short break and be right back. You are

611
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,640
listening to Shaping Fire and my guest

612
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,640
today is plant biochemist Dr. Paula

613
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:04,398
Berman. Fish Poop brand fertilizer is an

614
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:07,119
all-natural Omry certified fish poop

615
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:10,000
concentrate with nothing added. Real

616
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,839
fish poop is extraordinarily complex.

617
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,759
Not only are you adding the nitrogen,

618
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,079
phosphorus, and potassium your plants

619
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,960
need to build mass, transport nutrients,

620
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,480
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is

621
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,000
also packed with probiotics and

622
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,558
micronutrients. When you add fish poop

623
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,880
to your irrigation water, you are adding

624
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:32,158
fertilizer in a form that strengthens

625
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,159
the soil food web in your garden.

626
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,278
Because plants are limited by the

627
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,440
absence of any essential micronutrient,

628
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,679
these trace nutrients are the difference

629
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,200
between having a decent garden and

630
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,320
having a garden that makes you feel

631
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,640
really proud of your efforts. Fish poop

632
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,558
is a naturally complete solution that

633
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,880
fills in the cracks in your fertilizer

634
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,839
program to ensure that you offer your

635
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,600
garden a broad base of

636
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:00,240
nutrients. Not all fish poop is created

637
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,759
equally. Most products with added fish

638
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,519
waste don't reveal their sources or lab

639
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:08,079
results. Fish Poop brand Fish Poop,

640
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,079
however, generates their own fish waste

641
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,240
as a byproduct of their organic

642
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,359
aquaponics cannabis farm where they

643
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,599
raise ornamental koi and tilapia. You

644
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,678
are even invited to tour their farm in

645
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,918
person or on their YouTube channel to

646
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,919
look for yourself. This sort of

647
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,720
transparency is wildly rare in the

648
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,200
fertilizer market. The folks behind Fish

649
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,278
Poop are also lifelong medical cannabis

650
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,519
producers who have deep connections in

651
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,599
the community, donate more product than

652
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,759
they sell, and support cannabis

653
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,558
prisoners, veteran, and patient

654
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:43,558
collectives and charities. To get your

655
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:46,480
bottle of pure fish poop, go to

656
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:49,839

Amazon or walmart.com. And to see their

658
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:56,959
entire line of cannabis products, go to

659
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:59,319
ounceofhope.com. That's fish poop brand

660
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,519
fish

661
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:03,200
poop. You've heard me talk about the

662
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,038
award-winning cannabis seeds that come

663
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,038
from the analytical breeding program of

664
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,079
Seth and Eric Crawford, who founded

665
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:12,798
Oregon CBD Seeds. In fact, Seth was a

666
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,759
guest on Shaping Fire in 2020 to talk

667
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:18,158
about triploid genetics. Seth and Eric

668
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,440
are now releasing high THC seeds for

669
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,880
home growers and farms as

670
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,798
Growtherevolution Seeds at gtr

671
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,039
seeds.com. Their high THC seeds are

672
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,918
extraordinary in that they will start to

673
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:34,480
flower at 16 1/2 hours of daylight

674
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,278
instead of the typical 14 1/2 hours of

675
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,960
daylight. That means in most regions

676
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,359
your plants will start to flower

677
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,440
outdoors in the middle of July instead

678
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,439
of the middle of August. which means

679
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,159
these photo period plants finish in

680
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,960
September and not October, totally

681
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,278
upending the photo period seed market.

682
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,919
Seth and Eric took their prized early

683
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,398
flowering CBG line and bred it to some

684
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,480
of the most desired verified genetics

685
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:03,119
out there, including Sour Diesel,

686
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,679
Triangle Kush, Wedding Cake, Chem Dog,

687
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,918
Skittles, and others. These crosses all

688
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,480
express powerful photo period tarpine

689
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:15,120
profiles and THC, giving you a great

690
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,519
high. GTR Seeds has a new THCV line with

691
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:21,678
plants like double Durban and Gigantor

692
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,079
that boasts 1:1 THC to THCV and people

693
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,960
want that

694
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:30,079
THCV. GTR seeds are very consistent true

695
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,720
growing inbred F1s from stabilized

696
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:35,119
inbred parent lines. These seeds are

697
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,679
nearly homogeneous and the plants should

698
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,239
all grow the same. There is only one

699
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,038
phenotype in every pack available as

700
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,200
diploids and triploids. Seth and Eric's

701
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:47,038
company is still familyowned, patient

702
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,000
and employee centric and partially

703
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,200
powered by their 2 acres of solar

704
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,440
panels. Everyone can purchase these

705
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,558
seeds and the entire catalog of Oregon

seeds.com today and choose something

708
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:06,200
revolutionary for your next indoor or

709
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,200
outdoor run.

710
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,359
One of the challenges with buying

711
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,359
autoflower seeds is that often you'll

712
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,000
have as many different fenos as you will

713
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,798
have seeds in a pack. That can be fun,

714
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,119
sure, but so many varieties in one pack

715
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:22,000
is a sign of an immature seed line that

716
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,599
hasn't been worked enough. I prefer my

717
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,599
autoflowers to be worked enough that

718
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,038
each pheno in the pack really captures

719
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,480
the aspects that the breeder was

720
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,119
intending.

721
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,798
This is why I recommend Gnome Automatics

722
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,439
to my friends and listeners who grow

723
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,278
automatic flowering cannabis seeds.

724
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,038
Gnome automatic seeds are not just

725
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,519
crossed and released. They are

726
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:43,759
painstakingly sifted again and again,

727
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,919
tested in a wide range of conditions,

728
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,119
and taken to a level of maturity that

729
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,880
each plant will be recognizable by its

730
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:52,798
traits. Traits that were hard-earned so

731
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,000
that you can have your best growth cycle

732
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,398
ever. Over the last 10 years, Gnome

733
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,398
Automatics founder Dan Jimmy has become

734
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,398
a trusted breeder, and he continues to

735
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,558
pour his passion of breeding cannabis

736
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:07,678
into every variety he releases for you

737
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:10,119
to grow. Check out the Gnome Automatics

website. Commercial cannabis farms

745
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,679
across the country love growing Gnome

746
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,519
automatics because of their consistency

747
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:34,399
from seed to seed, short grow times, THC

748

percentages, and colorful bag appeal.

749
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:40,518
Farms interested in bulk seeds of more

750
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:42,558
than a thousand should reach out through

Automatics. Welcome back. You are

758
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:02,000
listening to Shaping Fire and I am your

759
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:05,038
host Shangol Los. And my guest today is

760
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,278
plant biochemist Dr. Paula Berman. So

761
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,480
Dr. Berman, in the first set we talked a

762
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:13,838
lot about um the heli plant and where it

763
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,280
lives and and how it expresses itself. I

764
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,119
would like to talk a little bit more

765
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,200
generally about canabonoids. We've

766
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,200
certainly done plenty of episodes of

767
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,838
shaping fire on canabonoids for folks

768
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,960
who really want to get into them, but

769
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:29,039
for for folks that this is their um you

770
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,119
know early uh understanding of

771
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,759
canabonoids, would you explain why

772
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,559
plants produce canabonoids or or why we

773
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,520
think that they produce canabonoids?

774
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:41,960
H okay. So first of all I would like to

775
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,719
say that h why

776
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:49,760
are the type of question that is the

777
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:52,078
hardest to answer in biology. Um and

778
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,240
let's talk a bit about any type of

779
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,000
specialized metabolites. So plants

780
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,078
produce specialized metabolites. So

781
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,639
canabonoids are type of specialized

782
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,440
metabolites. These are small molecules

783
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:06,719
secondary metabolites unlike primary

784
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,280
metabolites. These are molecules that h

785
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:12,000
the plant h doesn't have to have them to

786
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,839
survive but it helps them flourish in

787
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,760
their environment. So these are

788
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,599
molecules that the plant produces. They

789
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,480
can be very very different between

790
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,480
plants from different families even from

791
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,119
the same family from different genuses

792
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,920
they can be ex they can have completely

793
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,400
different types of molecules. And the

794
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,880
reason that a plant produces a specific

795
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,280
type of molecule is because um it helps

796
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,720
them um flourish. So for example, it

797
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,119
gives them h protection

798
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:46,439
um to cope with different types of

799
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:50,000
stresses like for

800
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:54,240
um fighting with herbivores or pathogens

801
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,639
that come to try to h damage the plant.

802
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:00,479
uh they provide protection from abiotic

803
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,159
stresses like uh UV radiation. Uh they

804
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,358
have antioxidant

805
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:10,319
uh effects um uh and they also attract

806
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:13,838
different types of pollinators or seed

807
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,880
dispers. So h basically um it is not

808
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:19,039
known for sure what is the actual role

809
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,800
of canabonoids in the plant. It's

810
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,079
believed that is possibly one of these

811
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,760
that I mentioned now.

812
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:29,920
Um um but uh for sure it uh the plant

813
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,720
produces cannabonoids. It invests a lot

814
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,960
of energy to produce these cannaboids h

815
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:38,879
because it gives them some kind of an

816
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,679
evolutionary advantage. That makes

817
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,000
sense. Does does this discovery change

818
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,799
or evolve our understanding of the

819
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,559
evolution of canabonoids? Um I can

820
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,320
imagine that um like while while we were

821
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,880
surprised and excited to find

822
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,119
canabonoids in this plant, there may be

823
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,320
other plants that are also expressing in

824
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,760
similar ways. But but h have us f have

825
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,119
we finding canabonoids in this plant um

826
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,520
you know kind of changed our

827
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,800
understanding of canabonoids.

828
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:14,480
H so I think it it for sure helps the

829
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,599
trying to answer the reason why h the

830
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,039
plant evolved to produce cannabonoids. H

831
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:24,000
but we are not there yet. Um we have

832
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,559
several suggestions of how or what might

833
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
have

834
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:32,320
happened or how did the

835
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,639
evolution encourage the plant to or push

836
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,920
the plant h to start producing these

837
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:40,799
types of molecules. So h the the basis

838
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,039
comes from the from from the enzymes

839
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,440
from the biology of the plant. So a

840
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,960
plant will not start to produce h

841
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,720
molecules um

842
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,838
um that are very very different. it will

843
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:56,719
not make up an

844
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:58,559
enzyme. H it's probably a an enzyme that

845
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,879
is already there, a type of protein that

846
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:04,239
was already in the plant that will

847
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,440
mutate h slowly until it makes some

848
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:10,000
change that the plant h feels that h is

849
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,039
advantageous and then this is maintained

850
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,719
for next generations. So we believe that

851
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:19,679
h by looking into other members of the

852
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:22,799
families from other types of elicomes,

853
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,440
other types of plants from the astro

854
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:30,280
family because el chrysome is a astro

855
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:34,400
plant h which is very distant

856
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:38,880
than cannabis which is an a cannabis

857
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,639
plant. H and by looking into uh other um

858
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,320
family members that don't produce

859
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,799
cannabonoids but when we are looking

860
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,200
into what other chemicals they do

861
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,960
produce h we found some uh

862
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:53,118
commonalities. So for example um we

863
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,519
think that in order for a plant to

864
00:38:53,119 --> 00:39:00,160
produce can carabonoids h it will start

865
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:03,440
by having probably a analactivating

866
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:06,799
enzyme that will use fatty acids h to

867
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,240
produce h this alkal chain that we have

868
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,240
h for canabonoids or that is also found

869
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,879
for fluoroglyucenoids which are also

870
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:19,639
found in hopes for example we will have

871
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:23,039
a polyatase that H erh will do

872
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:26,559
the will probably do a specific type of

873
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,679
of cizization for example uh for making

874
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:32,679
fluoroglucenoids or chalons which are

875
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:36,358
more available in nature and this will

876
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:39,199
possibly mutate into h making the

877
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:42,159
backbones the chemical structure for the

878
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:45,838
canabonoids or the a more protein types

879
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:47,759
of cannabonoids. So um they will start

880
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,559
to do a different type of tilization

881
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,359
which we see in both these plants. And

882
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,000
then we also have a prenal transfer that

883
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:58,639
we found in our study that was very uh

884
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
specific that would work only on the

885
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:04,519
types of molecules that have this h it's

886
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,440
a resource

887
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:09,519
backbone which is found in carbonids

888
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,480
versus the one from fluoroglucenoids or

889
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,480
the other types of compounds. So we

890
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,838
think that we have some clues about what

891
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,559
types of plants would also perhaps uh

892
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,559
produce or can be good candidates to

893
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:24,559
produce cannabonoids. But of course

894
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,039
there are also a lot of questions that

895
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,880
we didn't look

896
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:32,079
at still that have to do with for

897
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,720
example localization of enzymes

898
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,400
transport

899
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:40,639
toxicity availability of intermediates

900
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,639
for the uh for this pathway to evolve.

901
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,639
Um

902
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,440
that that is so exciting. You know,

903
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,159
listening to your

904
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,800
answer, there are so many different

905
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:55,719
opportunities for medical research, for

906
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,560
botanical research, for for healing

907
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:00,358
opportunities in so many of the

908
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,880
different

909
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:05,119
um I don't know research opportunities

910
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,640
that you just went through. I mean a as

911
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,160
some as as somebody who has studied the

912
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:14,559
endockinabonoid system, it's it is just

913
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:17,598
so wildly exciting to have another way

914
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,679
in to start to compare and contrast to

915
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,519
with the other plants that we've already

916
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,078
that we're already familiar with. And

917
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:27,599
and this is before you add all the

918
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:30,079
additional um uh uh other tarpen and

919
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,240
other aromatic compounds that are also

920
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,720
interacting with all these canabonoids

921
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:39,439
to create new ways. Oh,

922
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:42,078
fantastic. So, so the plant itself is is

923
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,679
it hard to grow the heli plant or is it

924
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,960
pretty easy?

925
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:50,159
Um so we started growing it from seeds

926
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,720
and actually it wasn't that easy to

927
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:57,440
germinate the the seeds.

928
00:41:53,719 --> 00:42:00,078
Um but since once we we managed to

929
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:04,720
germinate we propagated dur using

930
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:07,280
cutings h and this h grow very well. H

931
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:11,279
unfortunately up to this uh point we

932
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,319
haven't uh uh been able to uh produce

933
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,640
seeds out of the plants our m mature

934
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,639
plants. I mean they produce seeds but

935
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,279
they don't germinate. So interesting. Up

936
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,078
until now we've only propagated them via

937
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,319
cutings. Oh that's interesting. So

938
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,240
that's a whole but it it grows very

939
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:32,880
well. We grow them in a greenhouse

940
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:34,679
and they flourish. Even though that uh

941
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,079
even though you're not

942
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:40,239
producing viable seeds yet, is the plant

943
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,240
itself and seeds for it very easy to get

944
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:45,118
in South Africa or is it a rare plant

945
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:48,118
there? I think that in South Africa it

946
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,800
it grows wild in

947
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:54,519
nature. I I don't think that it's very

948
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:58,160
easy to get h seeds.

949
00:42:54,519 --> 00:43:00,159
Um but uh yeah but the the plant I I

950
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,960
it's it's a plant that grows wild when

951
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:05,838
you uh from what I understood I've never

952
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,880
been there but when you uh walk around

953
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:13,799
you can see uh these plants everywhere.

954
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:16,960
Very good. Um, so in the lab,

955
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,839
um, I'm curious to know what extraction

956
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:24,559
methods you use to remove the

957
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:28,078
canabonoids, um, to isolate them. And is

958
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:30,480
the extraction or uh, isolation process

959
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,039
with this plant any easier or more

960
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,960
difficult than than cannabis, or or is

961
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,800
it about the same because you're just

962
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,519
trying to get canabonoids out of plant

963
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,440
material? So it's it's pretty

964
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:43,599
straightforward. It's the same as what

965
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,240
we do for cannabis h to extract

966
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,440
canabonoids from

967
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,199
cannabis. So there are many ways that

968
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,480
you can extract this, but what we

969
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,960
usually do in the lab is just a simple

970
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:58,079
ethanolic extraction.

971
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,559
Mhm. So, um you may not know this next

972
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,599
question because it's it's very cannabis

973
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:07,358
um user centric, but um are are you

974
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:10,400
familiar at all with how um traditional

975
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:13,598
uh cannabis enthusiasts will use ice

976
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,039
water and ice to make the tricoms on a

977
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,519
cannabis plant uh cold and then and then

978
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,000
mix them. So the tricoms break off and

979
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,639
settle into the bottom and then are

980
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,400
concentrated that way to make hashish.

981
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:29,199
Is that would that be possible with this

982
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,318
plant? Are the tricoms brittle and

983
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:36,879
removable like that on this plant? So

984
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:39,358
the tricoms on this plant have although

985
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,318
there are also tricoms but they they're

986
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:44,880
um they have quite a different uh

987
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,759
structure. They have a much stocker a

988
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:52,079
shorter stock compared to the ones from

989
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,319
cannabis. And we did try to um purify

990
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,440
tricoms because we were interested in

991
00:44:54,318 --> 00:45:01,358
doing anal analysis of single tricoms

992
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,079
and it was much harder to do than uh in

993
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:05,679
cannabis. Very good. Thank you. That's

994
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,400
of course we're curious to know can we

995
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,639
make hash out of

996
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,400
it? Do the do the canabonoid levels vary

997
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:13,838
depending on the growing conditions? I'm

998
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,599
not sure if you've gotten to that part

999
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,719
of the research yet, but uh it's worth

1000
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,640
asking. So, we didn't go we didn't get

1001
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,358
to that part yet. I'm sure that they

1002
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:26,000
will change just like any other type of

1003
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:27,838
plant that will be affect. So, any type

1004
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,920
of specialized metabolites in plants

1005
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:34,799
will change h in response to any type to

1006
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,519
to specific types of stress or growing

1007
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,280
conditions uh for the good or for the

1008
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:43,759
bad. H um does the plant contain

1009
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,920
canabonoids throughout its entire life

1010
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,720
cycle or only at certain stages? Uh we

1011
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,079
found them in all the

1012
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:54,000
[Music]

1013
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:57,280
stages and in all the tissues besides

1014
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,599
the roots as I mentioned and since it's

1015
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,920
an all all year round growing plant h

1016
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,280
you have them all year round as well.

1017
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,119
That's great. So it's not like in

1018
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,800
cannabis where you need you start

1019
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,760
growing and then you need to wait until

1020
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,519
you get the plant h to flower and then

1021
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,359
you have a limited amount of time that

1022
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,000
the plant is flowering and then after

1023
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:22,719
that you need to have another cycle here

1024
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:26,239
the plant h just grows h all the time

1025
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:29,118
and you can use the biomass. It sounds

1026
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:32,000
It sounds also that since it's um since

1027
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,119
the tricoms have got canamonoids in it

1028
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,519
year round that it might be possible to

1029
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,559
treat this as an ever growing plant too

1030
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:42,559
where where maybe you're growing a a

1031
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,799
larger shrub of it and you harvest half

1032
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,719
of it and then you let the rest of it go

1033
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,240
and then you harvest it again later.

1034
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:53,039
Does that seem reasonable for this

1035
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:56,479
plant? Yes, definitely. Wonderful. Um,

1036
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:58,318
uh, let's see here. Um, so from what

1037
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,679
you've seen so far, and I I understand

1038
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,079
this research may not have been done

1039
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:04,960
yet, have have you found any potential

1040
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:08,000
benefits that might make it superior to

1041
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,920
cannabis for certain canabonoid um,

1042
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,719
applications.

1043
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:17,838
Um, so h first of all, the fact that it

1044
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:20,879
has high CBG like we mentioned before

1045
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:23,759
versus other types of cannabonoids. H

1046
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,240
also the fact that it has no THC, it's

1047
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,640
it makes its legal status uh much

1048
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,879
easier. I mean it doesn't it's not

1049
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:33,519
illegal like uh cannabis. Even cannabis

1050
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:38,240
that is high CBD with very low amounts

1051
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:42,559
of THC. H it's still not it's not in the

1052
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,399
same uh status as the helipant. H like

1053
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,239
we mentioned we have a all year round

1054
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,480
supply of cannabonoids h and the leaves

1055
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,799
that are the most abundant ones uh so

1056
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,079
you don't need to wait for flowering of

1057
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,839
course the fact that you have

1058
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,720
canabonoids that are not present in

1059
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:01,920
cannabis h it's also another advantage

1060
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:04,358
that might have h different types of h

1061
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,519
bioactivities as well as also

1062
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:11,519
non-cannabinoid molecules h in cannabis

1063
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:13,519
you have these h canoflavs for example h

1064
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,960
But these are very very much much much

1065
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:20,159
lower concentrations compared

1066
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:24,000
to to cannabonoids. In the helip plant

1067
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:26,159
you have a lot of flavonoids amorphins

1068
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,400
and other types of compounds that are

1069
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:34,399
very abundant and in look like similar

1070
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,480
concentrations like the canabonoids.

1071
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,480
What is the what is the aroma of the

1072
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,838
plant itself when you're just in when

1073
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,119
you're in the greenhouse? What do you

1074
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:47,358
smell? It's a beautiful aroma. It's like

1075
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:51,200
a very light perfume smell. Nothing like

1076
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:54,400
cannabis. Is it Is it more floral and

1077
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:58,239
pleasant or is it is it more like like

1078
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:01,920
like stanky beautiful? No. No. It's like

1079
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:03,959
a floral. Very floral. Yeah. Like a

1080
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,480
perfume. Mhm.

1081
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:10,720
Um uh so when

1082
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:13,119
you when you started publishing your

1083
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:17,439
results and people started um noticing

1084
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:20,000
it um have you gotten um the support

1085
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,119
that you would hope to have gotten in

1086
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,519
order to continue with this research and

1087
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,400
and increase our familiarity with the

1088
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:31,358
plant. It sounds like the the the

1089
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,599
reaction to your research itself was

1090
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,598
positive. Uh I'm asking this question

1091
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,400
more about the going concern like going

1092
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,640
into the future like do you have the

1093
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,800
support that you need now to continue

1094
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:48,318
this research to get us more familiar

1095
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:52,559
with this plant? Um so um yes I mean we

1096
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:54,800
have no um barriers at the moment h to

1097
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,519
continue this uh type of research. Of

1098
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,200
course the the biggest barrier is time.

1099
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:03,960
Yeah, because we are

1100
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:07,439
also studying other plants and

1101
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,318
other we have other goals that we want

1102
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,800
to achieve. But this is s is definitely

1103
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,960
something that uh we are planning to

1104
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,800
continue. We have some more questions

1105
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:21,679
that we are planning to

1106
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:23,680
answer and we yes we we don't have any

1107
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:26,159
problems continuing working on it.

1108
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,919
That's fantastic. So, in set three,

1109
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,759
we're going to talk more about uh the

1110
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,200
future and and what some of the

1111
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,559
strategies of interacting with this

1112
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:33,598
plant look like. But for right now,

1113
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,400
we're going to take our second

1114
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,720
commercial break. Um you are listening

1115
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,119
to Shaping Fire. And my guest today is

1116
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,558
plant biochemist Dr. Paula Berman. And

1117
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,079
you know, without these advertisers,

1118
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,160
Shaping Fire would not be able to

1119
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,839
continue. So, please support them and

1120
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:51,399
let them know that you heard of them on

1121
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,400
Shaping Fire.

1122
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,240
Revenue is tight for cannabis businesses

1123
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,558
right now. There is no question about

1124
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,838
it. And when revenue tightens,

1125
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,200
businesses need to spend smarter on

1126
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:05,119
advertising. Instead of throwing obscene

1127
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:06,480
money at hanging your company's logo

1128
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,720
from the rafters at your next

1129
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,440
convention, perhaps consider placing

1130
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:13,439
commercials on Shaping Fire. And if you

1131
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,358
are a very small business, there is

1132
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,838
simply no better bang for your buck than

1133
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,519
commercials on shaping fire, especially

1134
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:20,679
if your products are for regeneratively

1135
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,119
minded

1136
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:24,879
cultivators. Advertising on this show

1137
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,280
allows us time to talk about your

1138
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,039
product, service, or brand in a way that

1139
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,519
really lets people know what sets your

1140
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,440
company apart from the others. Bold

1141
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,119
people who own companies know that

1142
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,599
getting into relationship with their

1143
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:40,318
customers is essential. That is what we

1144
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,160
offer. We will explain your service or

1145
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,480
product, what sets it apart as

1146
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,639
desirable, and help our audience get in

1147
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,559
contact with you. It's pretty simple

1148
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,879
really. Advertising does not have to be

1149
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,880
all whisbang smoke and mirrors.

1150
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,838
Nowadays, I find that people prefer just

1151
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,079
to be spoken to calmly, accurately, and

1152
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:59,599
with good intentions. If you want to

1153
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,920
make your own commercial spot, you can

1154
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,599
do that, too. With a commercial on

1155
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,039
Shaping Fire, you'll reach your

1156
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,280
customers in the privacy of their

1157
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:09,199
headphones right now and will continue

1158
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,960
to reach new listeners as they explore

1159
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:14,558
the Shaping Fire back catalog of

1160
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,880
episodes again and again for years. A

1161
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,119
spot-on Shaping Fire costs less than a

1162
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,318
postcard per person. And the Shaping

1163
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,358
Fire audience is full of smart cannabis

1164
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:25,199
enthusiasts, cultivators, and

1165
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:28,078
entrepreneurs who are always curious to

1166
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:30,000
learn. And right now in the new year, we

1167
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,800
are booking the few open spots we have

1168
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,119
for the rest of 2024. I'd love for you

1169
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,800

cannabis. I'm talking to home growers,

1176

patients, and commercial growers, too.

I'm probably talking to you. When you

1178
00:52:56,318 --> 00:52:59,558

cannabis in Humbult, Mendescino, and

00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,239
Trinity counties. Because of his lineage

1188
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,318
and the hard-earned experience that

1189
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,239
comes from growing up smoking and

1190
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:26,400
sifting large populations of cannabis

1191
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,558

Triangle, is a breeders breeder. He

1199
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,200

1200
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,719
significant strains, recreating them in

1201
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,519

00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:03,519
step and selfs all these kovars so you

1207
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:06,318
know all the seeds will be female. These

1208
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:08,480
are not experimental feminiz seeds.

1209
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:10,960
Humboldt CSI releases some of the best

1210

Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humble Gen

1213
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,680
X last year here on Vashon Island, and

1214
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,838
everyone was pleased. The patients had

1215
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:23,358
beautiful female plants and didn't have

1216
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:25,838
to callull half of their garden as

1217
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:28,318
males. The folks growing for the fun of

1218
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:30,799
getting high grew colorful flowers with

1219
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,960
exceptional bag appeal and great highs.

1220
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,039
And breeders had seven out of seven

1221
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,760
females in a pack, which gave them a lot

1222
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:41,599
of phenotypic choices. Take a moment

1223

1269
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,760
biochemist Dr. Paula Berman. And um we

1270
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,519
we've been talking Dr. Burman and I were

1271
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,400
talking during the break about how much

1272
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:28,719
I feel like a you know a cheerleader for

1273
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,400
this plant because you know all of us

1274
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,598
who have been studying canabonoids and

1275
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,000
have been caring about you know

1276
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,079
endockinabonoid medicine for years and

1277
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,838
and have worked with the plant you know

1278
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,720
we've we've all got this very close

1279
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:42,239
relationship with cannabis and and we're

1280
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,558
always trying to find the plant and

1281
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:47,598
learn about the plant to find out that

1282
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,240
there is another plant that produces

1283
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,559
canabonoids in these volumes that is

1284
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:55,439
doesn't have the same legal structures

1285
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,680
around it. It it's it just creates it

1286
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,639
just feels like this huge opportunity

1287
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:03,239
where we can practice healing in a way

1288
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:07,118
that um might not be

1289
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:09,639
um so inaccessible due to the laws and

1290
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:13,760
and um and and and I

1291
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:15,358
just it's fun to I I I'm probably going

1292
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,440
to embarrass you a little bit, Paula,

1293
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:19,440
but you're kind of like a hero to us,

1294
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,519
right? like the research that you're

1295
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,240
doing is is something that we all are

1296
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:26,798
looking for and you're at at the at the

1297
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:28,399
front of it. So, so uh I know I'm

1298
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:30,880
fanboying about it, but I have a feeling

1299
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,119
that you don't get enough of that and so

1300
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,680
I'm just I'm just letting my freak flag

1301
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,519
fly so so that you understand how much

1302
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:39,199
we appreciate this research that you're

1303
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:41,599
doing.

1304
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:44,239
So, thank you very much. I would just

1305
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:48,240
like to mention that uh this project has

1306
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:51,279
been like a dream project to me. Um I've

1307
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:54,719
I've worked with the cannabis uh for uh

1308
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:59,000
for almost 5 years before I came to the

1309
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:03,399
Wiseman Institute and

1310
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:07,760
um and so cannabis cannab is kind of my

1311
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:09,720
uh true passion. Uh but uh having this

1312
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,440
uh uh

1313
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:18,639
so having the opportunity to work on

1314
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:21,119
this uh um uh study that was so uh

1315
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:23,118
preliminary the the information that was

1316
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,160
known about it was so preliminary and

1317
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:28,240
everything that we found was new and uh

1318
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,719
thinking about how the prospects of

1319
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:35,039
working on this uh topic and what can

1320
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:37,679
come out out of this uh study h is truly

1321
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:40,558
exciting. for us as well. So, thank you

1322
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:43,358
for the support. Absolutely. And and and

1323
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,480
I and I don't don't go away listener yet

1324
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:46,480
because we still have more to talk

1325
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,119
about, but this seems like a really good

1326
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,960
time for me to ask you. You you you have

1327
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,280
mentioned a couple times how important

1328
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,960
the other people involved have been in

1329
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,640
this research and you asked for an

1330
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,240
opportunity to acknowledge them. Let's

1331
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,679
it seems like it's just fitting to go

1332
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:01,279
ahead and put that in here and then

1333
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:02,558
we'll then we'll continue with our

1334
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,119
conversation on pharmaceutical

1335
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,480
companies. So, so who are those those

1336
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,640
other folks that you wanted to make sure

1337
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,280
to acknowledge? So, I just wanted to

1338
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:14,960
mention that I was part of a team. So,

1339
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,040
we work with Professor Asafar on his lab

1340
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,400
in the Wiseman Institute and he is of

1341
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:22,880
course the the principal investigator of

1342
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,720
true inspiration really he's like such

1343
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:29,519
an enthusiast about plant science and uh

1344
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:31,759
uh everything related to small molecules

1345
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,920
and biochemistry and I learned so much

1346
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,599
from him. I wanted also to acknowledge

1347
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,680
uh Luis Adam Prashant three other

1348
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:41,798
postocs uh that also worked on this uh

1349
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,838
project. Luis is a

1350
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:45,798
bioinformatician and he did all the

1351
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:49,199
genome and the

1352
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:51,838
transcriptto in this study. Adam Adam

1353
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:54,078
and Prashan that did a lot of the

1354
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:56,078
molecular biology and taught me how to

1355
00:59:54,079 --> 01:00:01,119
do a lot of the things that we did here

1356
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:03,920
in this work. H Dong H was also a do

1357
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:07,119
postoc h that helped me with the maldi

1358
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:10,318
imaging and uh feeding of plants. H we

1359
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,798
have Tally from the NMR unit and Sadaran

1360
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:15,358
Deal from the electronic microscopic

1361
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:19,199
unit microscope unit in the Wiseman

1362
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:23,519
Institute that helped me um really have

1363
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:25,519
the most amazing uh images of tricoms

1364
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:27,920
and many other people that I will not

1365
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:29,920
mention although they contributed a lot

1366
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,159
other people from uh the lab. So thank

1367
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,000
you for the opportunity to mention them.

1368
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,159
Absolutely. And and thank you to

1369
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,159
everyone on your team for this very

1370
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:39,759
important research that you're doing.

1371
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:42,239
All right. So, let's let's continue to

1372
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,319
look a little bit more forward. So, so

1373
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:46,479
we're at this interesting time with this

1374
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:48,719
plant where, you know, we're still doing

1375
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,760
the fundamental research to figure out

1376
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:55,118
how this plant expresses itself. We also

1377
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,599
know that um you know, pharmaceutical

1378
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:00,400
companies are always looking for uh

1379
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:02,400
early stage new drugs. Have we gotten to

1380
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,318
the part that pharmaceutical companies

1381
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,160
are starting to become engaged with this

1382
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:10,639
research or are we still a little early

1383
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:13,558
yet? Uh so I think for us it's still an

1384
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:19,039
early stage. I mean we have not been

1385
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:21,880
uh doing uh any active uh research on

1386
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:24,960
the with pharmaceutical

1387
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:26,960
companies but I am sure that it will

1388
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:30,039
also come.

1389
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:34,318
What do you think will be the long-term

1390
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:37,039
um uh how do I want to say this? What

1391
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:40,639
extraction method seems to work best on

1392
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:43,119
this plant as far as um moving towards

1393
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:45,039
scaled solutions? You know, for example,

1394
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:48,000
you mentioned in the lab you like to use

1395
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:51,440
ethanol um which is what a lot of uh

1396
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,199
home cannabis preparation um preparers

1397
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:57,920
use. Um but when it's scaled up um they

1398
01:01:55,199 --> 01:02:00,960
use different um extraction styles uh

1399
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:03,760
for large volumes. Will they be will

1400
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,039
they likely be the same extraction um

1401
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,839
varieties at at scale as as we see with

1402
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:14,079
cannabis or are there any intricacies in

1403
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:18,000
the plant that would um uh make that not

1404
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:20,079
as uh elegant? Uh no I I believe that

1405
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,798
the same types of extraction methods

1406
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,920
that apply to cannabis h will also be

1407
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:28,159
applied here. H in the past uh we also

1408
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,400
used to do a lot of uh ethanol

1409
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:34,480
extraction in in when we were studying

1410
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,480
cannabis ethanol extractions h also when

1411
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,159
we were scaling up I know that uh at

1412
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,920
least here in Israel it's considered

1413
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:45,759
like uh the standard method to make

1414
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:49,519
extracts h and it works pretty well with

1415
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,680
uh also with helip especially because h

1416
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:54,159
when it's intended for patients you

1417
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:57,399
don't want to use organic uh salt vents

1418
01:02:54,159 --> 01:03:02,879
or other methods that might be

1419
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:05,440
hazardous to to patients. Yeah. Um is

1420
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,519
your team working on uh breeding

1421
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,318
programs at all to increase the

1422
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,599
canabonoid production or are are we at

1423
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,000
the point where we're just trying to

1424
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:17,200
figure out how that's taking place to

1425
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,798
begin with? So we in the wisman

1426
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:25,598
institute don't work on h breeding. uh

1427
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:28,239
we we are trying to do some uh um

1428
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:30,440
genetic engineering transformation uh

1429
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:34,000
for the heli

1430
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,838
plant but uh we have not succeeded yet

1431
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
but it's definitely one of the things

1432
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:43,599
that we want to do to have the potential

1433
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:46,719
to um be able to uh knock out genes or

1434
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:51,599
to add genes for example imagine the the

1435
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:54,879
possibility of adding a CB CDA synthes

1436
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:57,440
into the heli uh plant that will allow

1437
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,440
you to make CBDA in the in the plant. We

1438
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,639
are talking about basically it's one

1439
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,119
gene that will take CBGA to produce

1440
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:08,480
CBDA. H of course there there might be

1441
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,559
also some other uh uh genes or some uh

1442
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:14,079
other proteins that are involved but to

1443
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:16,680
have this ability is h of course with

1444
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,680
very high potential and very interesting

1445
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:22,879
h overall also to have the ability to

1446
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:25,199
knock out genes to even for hel even for

1447
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,599
us to study what's the role of

1448
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:29,279
cannabonoids. So you asked me before h

1449
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,760
what is the role of cannabonoids to the

1450
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:35,119
plant. So one of the best ways that one

1451
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,520
would be able to test this is um if you

1452
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,559
have the ability if you have a a system

1453
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:42,318
to do transformation of a plant h to

1454
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,960
knock out specific genes and then you

1455
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:50,159
will have your mutant and you will have

1456
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:52,400
a the wild type plant. Um and then you

1457
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:55,038
can take both and and test them with

1458
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,798
different types of stresses with uh to

1459
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:01,839
see interaction with uh pollinators uh

1460
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:03,679
uh interaction with bacteria and so on.

1461
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:06,719
It will help you answer these type of

1462
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:08,798
questions. H another thing is another

1463
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:11,598
thing that we study in the lab a lot is

1464
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:14,318
the by synthetic pathway. So one of the

1465
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:17,119
aims of this study h besides the

1466
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:18,719
chemistry and uh all the work that we

1467
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,920
did was also to identify the

1468
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:23,838
biosynthetic pathway how the plant

1469
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:26,639
produces car cannaboids and once we

1470
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:30,239
found the specific enzymes then we have

1471
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:34,639
the ability we show how we can trans

1472
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:37,038
um take these um enzymes outside of the

1473
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:41,199
plant and express them in hetrology

1474
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:44,480
system. So being either other plants or

1475
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:47,598
in bacteria or in yeast and then to have

1476
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,719
a production of cannabonoids h without

1477
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:53,160
having the limitations of the plant or

1478
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:57,519
even to test this

1479
01:05:53,159 --> 01:06:02,318
h question h if you take for example a

1480
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:04,480
just as a a tomato or you take a a

1481
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:06,798
tobacco or some other model plant that

1482
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,039
people use biologist plant scientists

1483
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:10,639
use h that you know how to transform.

1484
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,559
And then you take the whole pathway of

1485
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:14,639
canabonoids and you put it inside these

1486
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,519
plants. And then again you have the

1487
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:20,558
tomato, the white type tomato and you

1488
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:24,159
have the mutant tomato and you can use

1489
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:26,640
these systems to try to understand um

1490
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:29,440
what these canabonoids do to the plant

1491
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:32,239
whether it helps them survive in which

1492
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:35,920
conditions h cope with which stresses

1493
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:38,239
and so on. there. You you describe so

1494
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,639
much different research all taking place

1495
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:43,199
on the plant at the same time. How many

1496
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:45,838
people do you have working on in in the

1497
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:48,879
lab on on these projects? I mean, it

1498
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:53,199
sounds like a huge number of people. So,

1499
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:55,599
so this specific project um brought

1500
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:59,279
together several

1501
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:01,599
um different people and not all of them

1502
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:05,559
working full-time only on this. several

1503
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:08,720
helped according to their um h

1504
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:11,599
specialty. Um yeah, but this is one

1505
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:12,639
advantage of working in this lab. The

1506
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,640
fact that you have such a

1507
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:16,759
multid-disiplinary team of analytical

1508
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:19,960
chemists and then molecular biologists

1509
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:23,760
and bioinformaticians

1510
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:26,880
and it again it's a really it's a big

1511
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:29,359
blessing and the type of lab where you

1512
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,519
can do this type of work where you can

1513
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:34,400
ask these questions and having all the

1514
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:36,559
tools that you need to to answer them.

1515
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,519
Sure. Can you can you just let us know

1516
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:41,760
is it more or less than 50 people? No,

1517
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:44,000
it's less than 50 people. So this is

1518
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,559
this is a this is a lot of passionate

1519
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,639
people cross crossworking on each

1520
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:53,119
other's projects so that so that um uh

1521
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:55,038
every everyone's project is lifted up at

1522
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,280
the same time. I like this there there

1523
01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:01,200
must be a lot of excitement um moving

1524
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:04,319
around the different cells of of the lab

1525
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:06,960
for yourself. What what are we um likely

1526
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:09,880
to see as the next published research

1527
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,639
coming out of your lab?

1528
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:14,160
Oh, so first of all we do in the lab a

1529
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:17,278
lot of things also not related to

1530
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:20,079
cannabonoids. Actually this was the only

1531
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,640
sorry not true we are also working on

1532
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:25,920
cannabis and we have a study that will

1533
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:29,920
be published I hope in the coming months

1534
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:32,880
h which I cannot uh too early say too

1535
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:37,759
much about it yes because I don't want

1536
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:40,159
to scoop us but h we are having some

1537
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,560
really cool uh results also on this

1538
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,158
other cannabis project but most of the

1539
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:48,600
other people in the lab don't work on

1540
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:52,158
cannabis We have a lot of um researchers

1541
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:54,480
on very different types of we ask

1542
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:59,238
different types of questions questions

1543
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:02,079
related to uh plant science. H me

1544
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:05,039
specifically h in the lab in the last

1545
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:07,519
years I've been working on um

1546
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:11,039
psychoactive plants. So last year we

1547
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:13,480
also published a a paper on the

1548
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:17,600
biosynthetic pathway of measculine in

1549
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:20,079
pot in alucogenic cacti h where we

1550
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,880
elucidated the bio synthetic pathway and

1551
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:24,399
I am working on another pathway that

1552
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,039
hopefully will be published in the

1553
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:28,198
coming months h which is also not

1554
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:29,719
carbonid

1555
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:32,559
but

1556
01:09:29,719 --> 01:09:34,319
psychedelic chemistry. I I which is

1557
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,798
really cool. I enjoyed reading that

1558
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:39,039
research last night actually. I uh in in

1559
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:41,119
in preparating preparing for our other

1560
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:44,000
aspects, I I stumbled ac across the

1561
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:45,519
peyote paper and I'm like, my gosh, Dr.

1562
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,479
Burman is doing the most interesting

1563
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:52,640
research.

1564
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:54,959
Thank you. Uh so um so uh I've got two

1565
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:58,320
two questions for you kind of is is in

1566
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,119
moving us to wrapping up. So, so we

1567
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:03,359
understand that

1568
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:05,279
um the the genie is out of the bottle,

1569
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,359
if you will, as faring as far as this

1570
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:09,679
plant goes. We we know the canabonoids

1571
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:12,880
are there. We know that they there are a

1572
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:15,279
lot of them and that the plant is easier

1573
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,000
to use because of the of the legal

1574
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:20,559
reasons. Uh I'm curious though because

1575
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,800
we're still in the early stages when

1576
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,880
we're we're trying to find the basics

1577
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:29,279
about the plant. What do you foresee say

1578
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,800
10 years down the line being the status

1579
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:35,198
of this plant? You're see you see faster

1580
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,920
than anybody how quickly this research

1581
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:40,879
is taking place and the areas that are

1582
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,399
more likely to blossom to allow the pun.

1583
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,760
Um where where do you see our

1584
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,319
relationship with this plant in 10

1585
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,560
years?

1586
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:51,119
So I I can tell you what I would like to

1587
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,679
see. Sure, let's do that. I would really

1588
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:55,238
like to see

1589
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:58,760
um a lot more

1590
01:10:55,238 --> 01:11:02,959
research done on the bioactivities of

1591
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:04,719
the molecules that the plant produces. H

1592
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,039
I would really like to see that there is

1593
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,359
a transformation platform to do

1594
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:12,880
transformation of the plants. uh to be

1595
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:15,158
able to answer all these really amazing

1596
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:21,520
interesting questions that I mentioned

1597
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:21,519
before and to have basically to have a

1598
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:27,679
a new uh even new types of molecules

1599
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,719
that we can produce and to learn much

1600
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,640
more about the

1601
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:35,920
plant and to have available products

1602
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,320
from the plant or inspired by the

1603
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:41,600
molecules in in the helicry plant. So

1604
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:43,359
even if it's not from hel once we learn

1605
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,960
about the bioactivities of these

1606
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:49,839
molecules. So to have h the opportunity

1607
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:53,359
of having h having them produce even

1608
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:56,800
outside of the plant h in other

1609
01:11:53,359 --> 01:12:00,799
platforms or other h systems and

1610
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:04,320
hopefully that they will help also um

1611
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:08,400
patients or people that uh h that need

1612
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:10,639
it. Excellent. So when we do research

1613
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:13,759
shows, I try to end with this question

1614
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:17,600
because I always want to encourage

1615
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:21,360
uh young new scienceminded

1616
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:24,159
uh folks who are in college or just out

1617
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:27,279
to inspire them that there is still so

1618
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:29,759
much research to be done uh in

1619
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:31,599
canabonoids that that this this area is

1620
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,520
just starting to blossom and it's a

1621
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,320
great time to get into this research.

1622
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:39,199
What kind of an advice would you give of

1623
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:43,439
the types of things to perhaps study and

1624
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:45,519
to uh bone up on for for canabonoid

1625
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:47,678
researchers who are still in college and

1626
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,520
but but would like to start moving into

1627
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,199
researching with this plant? What kinds

1628
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,880
of backgrounds and preparations should

1629
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:57,599
they be making? Um first of all I would

1630
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:01,279
tell them to go for it to go for

1631
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:04,960
studying cannabis cannabinoids h I think

1632
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:08,559
that h it's a it's a platform that can

1633
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:11,198
combine so many different uh disciplines

1634
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,800
uh starting from uh plant science

1635
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:16,919
chemistry uh

1636
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:19,279
biology of course uh medicine

1637
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:22,399
pharmacology uh there are so many

1638
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:24,880
questions that can be answered and there

1639
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:28,719
there is such a big huge potential to

1640
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:31,199
help other people uh by combining these

1641
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:34,319
disciplines. So I I would even advise

1642
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:37,359
people not to stick to only one part of

1643
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:39,759
the research but to actually combine. So

1644
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:42,319
look into the plant, see how the plant

1645
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:46,640
does what it does and then try to go

1646
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:50,000
outside of the plant h and also to test

1647
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:55,360
h to understand what it does uh to

1648
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:59,840
humans or we can uh uh push uh or use

1649
01:13:55,359 --> 01:14:03,119
the plant uh for new uh drugs or new

1650
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:06,880
treatments or new medications. H and I

1651
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:08,960
would also would would suggest to that

1652
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,199
it's important to keep in mind that uh

1653
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:14,079
this is still in the in the scientific

1654
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:16,719
com community it's still considered a

1655
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:19,840
bit of a controversial subject. So

1656
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:22,359
people that go into studying canabonoids

1657
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:25,760
need to be aware that

1658
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:29,198
h sometimes we find people researchers

1659
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:33,280
that work in this h field uh that that

1660
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:36,238
it has kind of a bad reputation and it

1661
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:39,039
it's sometimes hard to raise money for

1662
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:41,359
grants or convince researchers that what

1663
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:43,920
you're doing is serious research and

1664
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:46,479
that uh also when you want to submit or

1665
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,199
to publish there are sometimes

1666
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:50,599
journals that don't look into cannabis

1667
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:54,238
or canaboninoid

1668
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:57,880
research h the the best way. So just to

1669
01:14:54,238 --> 01:15:02,000
be patient and

1670
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:04,480
um the potential is huge. H so good

1671
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,198
luck. Very good. Well, thank you Dr.

1672
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:09,839
Burman. you know, um, we really

1673
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:13,119
appreciate when a scientist like

1674
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:15,760
yourself who is in deeply and on the

1675
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:18,399
front lines and and not usually

1676
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:21,520
available to, you know, just regular

1677
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:23,839
folks like us. um that you make the time

1678
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,239
to, you know, come out of the lab and

1679
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:29,679
into the daylight and talk to us so that

1680
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:31,919
we can um you know, encourage you and to

1681
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:36,319
and learn what you're doing and to

1682
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:38,319
encourage, you know, uh uh those who um

1683
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:41,198
to who fund your research to fund more

1684
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:43,039
of it. So, so thank you for sharing your

1685
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:46,238
time and your insight and your good

1686
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:47,679
cheer uh with us so that we could um

1687
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:50,079
learn more about this absolutely

1688
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,399
beautiful plant. Thank you so much.

1689
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:55,880
Thank you for uh the questions. Thank

1690

uh keep up with Dr. Burman, there are uh

1694
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,920
two ways to do that. Um you can follow

1695

Paula Berman. And then um if you have um

1698
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:24,079
a

1699

Dr. Burman through her email address for

1701
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:32,399
