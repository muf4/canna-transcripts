00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,199
a couple times a month i get emails from

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,039
listeners in prohibition states they

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,718
always express frustration and learning

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,320
of all the cannabis opportunities in

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,640
other states while their own state

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
continues to live in the 1980s

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,960
my heart always goes out to these folks

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,000
i'm talking about you friends in idaho

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,760
utah south dakota nebraska alabama and

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,879
indiana where i went to college and

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,720
slanged

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,879
i also feel for y'all who live in states

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,960
pretending to modernize and yet having

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,879
cbd only cannabis laws thc maximums or

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,039
simply broken systems that don't feel

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,718
like they will ever be repaired hell

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,479
that even includes my own state of

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,558
washington where we don't even have

20
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,119
pesticide testing on licensed products

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,679
or homegrown yet somehow

22
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,679
u.s cannabis legalization is a wreck it

23
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,840
is mostly being run by politicians who

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,679
don't know cannabis or cannabis medicine

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,480
and are more focused on making donors

26
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,198
happy than providing informed leadership

27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,118
between intransigent boomer politicians

28
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,920
and aggressive business-focused

29
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,840
lobbyists american cannabis is proudly

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
evolving the worst of all possible

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,240
situations

32
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:17,279
now this all sucks but understanding the

33
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,000
dynamics of what is going on is a major

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,320
key to us getting it all sorted out

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,159
while it is most common for we cannabis

36
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,559
folks to have a token mind our own

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,479
business there are a handful of cannabis

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,840
policy researchers out there who are

39
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,280
keeping score

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
looking at history to see what has

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,599
worked and failed in the past and are

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,920
coming up with novel ideas that help us

43
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,039
understand what the hell is going on and

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
why

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,840

dominick is also one of my most valued

96
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,360
friends i met dominic as i was making my

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
transition from the black market to

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
community organizing medical cannabis

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
cultivators back in 2013.

100
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,399
his mentorship connections and support

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
have been invaluable to my career the

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
forming of the vimeo organization here

103
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
on fashion island and my eventual

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
creation of shaping fire

105
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,080
it is likely true that shaping fire

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,919
would not exist today if dominic had not

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
encouraged me to pursue helping cannabis

108
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,039
patients and organized cannabis

109
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:55,039
education events all those years ago

110
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,479
finally dominic corva holds a special

111
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,719
place in the scene here in washington

112
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,719
state as is true in most states the

113
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,318
canvas seen here is pretty small and we

114
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,479
know each other and many of us came from

115
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,518
the underground dominic is someone

116
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:10,238
everyone embraces because he gets it his

117
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,400
depth on cannabis policy is immense

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,840
dominic understands the historical basis

119
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
for everything we see happening

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,879
nationally today and he way waves aside

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,799
the bro science that constitutes policy

122
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,000
discussion in most circles

123
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,399
dominic is a cannabis policy oracle and

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,040
he is a big-hearted lovable academic who

125
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,959
is embraced by everyone i know

126
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,360
today we are going to discuss the impact

127
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,918
of state licensing on long-term cannabis

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,240
farmers in california the awkwardness of

129
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,680
prohibition and licensed sales existing

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
at the same time

131
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,478
cannabis prohibition as a public health

132
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,199
issue

133
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,800
the profitable injustice of non-violent

134
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,879
cannabis prisoners

135
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,040

136

interpreting the the present with a firm

158
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,800
understanding of the past and how he got

159
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,879
here

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,439
the the 30 chapters provide a

161
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,519
substantial look into the most well

162
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,478
researched perspectives into these you

163
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,038
know rather complex cannabis topics

164
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,360
there's a lot written about cannabis

165
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,079
nowadays it's you know such a popular

166
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,319
topic in mainstream media but we know

167
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,839
they get a lot wrong all the time and it

168
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,160
frustrates us when we read this stuff

169
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,318
right also there are small cannabis

170
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,000
media companies inside of canvas that

171
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,240
aren't really mainstream who are just

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,240
slightly better but they still get

173
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,199
details and perspectives wrong all the

174
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,439
time

175
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,840
and then there is simply people with no

176
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,478
background fighting on the internet

177
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,799
the variety of research in this new book

178
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,758
is a different variety of any of those

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,120
three

180
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,800
it's vigorously researched and these are

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
top shelf

182
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,280
academics

183
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,199
looking at these cannabis topics and i

184
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,959
want people to understand why why this

185
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,478
is a different approach than most of the

186
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,239
stuff that they read out there so will

187
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,639
you start us out by explaining how a

188
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,000
collection of academic papers like this

189
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,680
is unlike the other examples i gave

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,478
yeah sure shango

191
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
so

192
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,279
there's really

193
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,879
two things that i define as you know

194
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,399
part of post-prohibition cannabis

195
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,240
research as opposed to just cannabis

196
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,318
research

197
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,960
post-prohibition first let's remember is

198
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,560
is a term that i use to refer to

199
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,478
cannabis with

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,319
not after prohibition cannabis

201
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:11,360
legalization with not after prohibition

202
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,598
and

203
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
the the concern as a social scientist

204
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,199
and as a geographer

205
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,038
was to collect

206
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,840
uh you know

207
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,680
to collect across five

208
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,119
meta categories

209
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,720
examples of research that did two things

210
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,478
one of two things and sometimes both of

211
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,680
two things

212
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,519
one of those i think people are more

213
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,360
familiar with which is you know now that

214
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,598
cannabis is legal

215
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,680
we can actually research you know

216
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,598
positive things about it

217
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,639
and the defining

218
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,478
prohibition research agenda was that

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,598
really you could only research things or

220
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,038
get funding

221
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,360
for research

222
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,560
uh to look at how you know cannabis was

223
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,400
bad right yeah and so that's that's the

224
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,319
kind of the first level and that's

225
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,638
that's a real accessible one i think you

226
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,598
know 80 wilson poe's opioid substitution

227
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,960
chapter is a really good example of that

228
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,000
but the other the other part of it is

229
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,359
that

230
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,959
you know

231
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,879
obviously we still have prohibition with

232
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,120
us we talk about cannabis legalization

233
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,319
often in a vacuum as though it's just

234
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
operating

235
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,800
and creating these just sort of legal

236
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
uh landscapes

237
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,639
when in fact those landscapes are

238
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,399
totally entangled with landscapes of

239
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,160
prohibition

240
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,560
and you know i'll just give you a couple

241
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,080
of examples the the most obvious one i

242
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,759
think readers will

243
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,240
get this right away is federal

244
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,278
prohibition still here and that means a

245
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,959
lot of things about what kind of

246
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,559
you know legal landscapes we can

247
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,838
construct they're

248
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,598
they're not

249
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,200
they're not for example uh you know

250
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,360
cannabis can't be agriculture in

251
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,040
california it's an agricultural product

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,879
and that means a million different

253
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,240
things for land use

254
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,600
uh it means a million different things

255
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,919
for other kinds of regulations and it

256
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
means a lot for about local control

257
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,199
right

258
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,600
uh local control being

259
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,519
you know sub-state jurisdictions get to

260
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,120
really do whatever they want

261
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,039
uh and that would be another aspect of

262
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,080
you know prohibition that continues

263
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,278
actually

264
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,759
because

265
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,919
as we we experienced in washington and

266
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,559
colorado a little bit but uh certainly

267
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,838
in california it's real obvious

268
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:24,159
that uh you know about two-thirds of the

269
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,399
jurisdictions in california and that is

270
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,240
56 counties and something like 450

271
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,278
cities

272
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,360
don't allow

273
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,320
uh you know cannabis businesses to

274
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
operate

275
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,839
which means we have a landscape it is a

276
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,119
patchwork quilt right of of

277
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,200
prohibitions

278
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,240
and uh and

279
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,160
legal

280
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,278
businesses that are operating

281
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,120
uh

282
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:50,399
and even in the jurisdictions where

283
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,839
legal jurisdictions are operating um

284
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,600
legal businesses are operating we

285
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,120
continue to of course have prohibition

286
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,879
on some things

287
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,440
so washington state most famously

288
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,679
obviously does not allow homegrow it is

289
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,560
illegal it is prohibited

290
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,319
so

291
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,199
in washington state therefore you know

292
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,959
legalization with prohibition means yeah

293
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,399
we've got legal cannabis but you can't

294
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,759
grow it at home without a license

295
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,639
and you can't get a license to grow at

296
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,439
home so

297
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,720
so

298
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,560
really the broad concept of you know how

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
legalization is entangled with

300
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,518
prohibition

301
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,759
it's really important to kind of start

302
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,039
with that uh for a lot of research

303
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,519
because

304
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,519
then the research agenda is

305
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
how do we disentangle

306
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,440
prohibition from legalization it's not

307
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,800
just how do we get legalization

308
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,399
it's that even though we're getting

309
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,479
legalization

310
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,320
we also still need to work to

311
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,360
disentangle prohibition from it and get

312
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,399
rid of it

313
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
and so

314
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,519
some of our authors are are really sharp

315
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,959
about this and focused on it

316
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,278
um

317
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,799
and i think that uh

318
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,958
you know sunil's chapter in public

319
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,278
health is a very interesting example of

320
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,879
a challenge to public health as an

321
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,799
institution as an

322
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,120
you know academic

323
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,599
meta institution

324
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,278
where they're still

325
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,720
still have a lot of those prohibition

326
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,639
assumptions that are attached to what

327
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
they do uh

328
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,879
and sunil talks about really like they

329
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
don't recognize the right to spiritual

330
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,519
health as part of what's on their agenda

331
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,359
so they they can't support research

332
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
that is is it about that kind of

333
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,320
positive

334
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,679
the last thing i want to say is that uh

335
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,079
there's kind of a third degree as well

336
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,159
uh and

337
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,319
it's a contextual one which is to say

338
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,399
that legalizations politics are

339
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,278
connected with and entangled with other

340
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,559
kinds of politics

341
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,320
and by that i mean

342
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,039
legalization

343
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,120
may in especially you know urban areas

344
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,719
be entangled with

345
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,200
what might be described as you know

346
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,759
especially public safety oriented

347
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,360
kind of liberal uh politics

348
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,720
that gets in the way of the

349
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
implementation of legalization you can

350
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,879
think about what about the kids as kind

351
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,959
of that research question that like

352
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,879
is kind of a liberal prohibition

353
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:14,000
question because it doesn't ask whose

354
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,919
kids right yeah um

355
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,759
uh and then also you know

356
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,719
there's a very interesting entanglement

357
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,799
with

358
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,480
maybe what are usually thought about as

359
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,879
libertarian and right-wing thoughts

360
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,079
about the free market right

361
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,320
um

362
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,479
and whether we should be you know

363
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,278
uh deregulating especially small

364
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,759
businesses let's say um which is not

365
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,480
traditionally something that is on

366
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,958
a left or liberal agenda so all of these

367
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,440
things have an effect on what kind of

368
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,679
legalization we get and where

369
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,360
uh and it's important to think about

370
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,159
those entanglements

371
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,440
so

372
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,919
we we're

373
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,440
promoting research agendas that almost

374
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,439
nobody else really

375
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,360
are thinking about the entanglements of

376
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,760
prohibition the entanglements

377
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,440
with other kinds of politics

378
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,799
um

379
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,720
and we do this it's a pretty big broad

380
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,000
set of observations

381
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,600
by

382
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,958
organizing it in

383
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,720
five meta issues right uh so governance

384
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,759
public health ecology and the

385
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,440
environment

386
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,039
markets and society and culture and

387
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,120
social change

388
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,120
and these are kind of interdisciplinary

389
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,839
clusters so when you say academic

390
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,200
academic means a lot of different things

391
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,320
um

392
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,399
academia is divided into a lot of silos

393
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,600
that we we we call disciplines usually

394
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,919
and so

395
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,560
the disciplines that really haven't

396
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,159
gotten as much run i think with with

397
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,000
either funding or recognition are the

398
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,919
social science disciplines

399
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,078
which have a long history of critical

400
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,399
analyses of prohibition

401
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,638
which is super important right so we

402
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,720
really got to draw on that right like

403
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,278
if we want a legal landscape that undoes

404
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,600
the harms of prohibition

405
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,838
then we need to draw on observations

406
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,079
insights and research

407
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,399
about prohibitions harms and those are

408
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,078
found pretty exclusively in the social

409
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,278
sciences

410
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,559
and so

411
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,399
we have a really broad array of folks

412
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,039
from different disciplines or from

413
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,000
interdisciplinary research clusters

414
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,480
uh

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
it can get a little complicated but

416
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,920
broadly speaking i think everyone kind

417
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,078
of understands okay governance is like

418
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,719
you know the law democracy

419
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,799
in you know institutions

420
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,800
you know uh public health includes

421
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,599
biomedical research uh as well as

422
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,639
uh

423
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,240
you know citizen science even um

424
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,360
uh

425
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,919
um

426
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,879
the ecology environment isn't just about

427
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,360
you know

428
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,720
the impacts of outdoor cultivation on

429
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,199
you know water supplies it's about

430
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,000
energy right and energy use

431
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:53,838
um

432
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,078
markets in society

433
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,000
include a discussion of like

434
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,078
what's so difficult like

435
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
why is it so difficult for people to

436
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,559
actually make money as small businesses

437
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,680
it's an important question to ask

438
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,159
um

439
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,239
and so forth so uh culture and social

440
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,838
change also deals with you know stigma

441
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
ongoing

442
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,800
stigma which i haven't talked about and

443
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,720
is one of those slippery

444
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,120
slippery concepts

445
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,360
because you can't quantify stigma you

446
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,078
can quantify maybe the effects of stigma

447
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,278
but you need really qualitative research

448
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,399
methods

449
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,759
to

450
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
dig into

451
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,000
you know how is stigma changing where's

452
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,399
it at um

453
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,480
who is continuing to be harmed by

454
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,559
stigmas of prohibition even in legal

455
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,639
landscapes and i would point out that

456
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,799
often it's medical patients

457
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,320
as as new heart and dolphin do in their

458
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,879
chapter

459
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,440
so before we get into some of those

460
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,480
parts you know specific topics um just

461
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,320
for folks who are interested in how the

462
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
compilation came together

463
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,240
you know with a with an ever

464
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,560
increasingly pool of talented academics

465
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,639
studying and writing about modern canvas

466
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,799
policy how did you go about choosing

467
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,240
your authors um you know you've put

468
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,078
together you know

469
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,799
like a literal dream team it's an

470
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,958
incredible cast of folks who are writing

471
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,919
did you choose the topics first and then

472
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,078
find the authors or did you choose an

473
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,198
author first and then invite them or a

474
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,599
topic or maybe something else entirely

475
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,758
well it was an iterative process shango

476
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,040
uh and so

477
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,600
do you want me to walk you through like

478
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,120
the whole thing or

479
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
just just you know give us a just give

480
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,639
us a thumbnail because um

481
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,440
because uh

482
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,879
i'm i'm looking for like a

483
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,160
um any

484
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:47,120
any like agenda that might be like under

485
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,278
underneath the people that you chose

486
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,039
and and then particularly

487
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,360
you know um

488
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,958
how one pulls together such an

489
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,320
incredible group but you know you don't

490
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,159
have to go deep into it because we want

491
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,240
to move on to the topic swiftly right

492
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,159
sure sure well

493
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,519
basically once we had figured out the

494
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,959
structure

495
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,279
that we wanted

496
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,279
um

497
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,599
josh and i

498
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,360
both reached out to you know

499
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,198
academics in our network that was that

500
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,918
was one of the first things that we did

501
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,600
and of course we're not new to the scene

502
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,679
uh you know we have a history of

503
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,838
publishing and

504
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,360
working with and and uh following the

505
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,838
research of

506
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,199
folks uh you know as far away as you

507
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:33,678
know uruguay and morocco and the uk

508
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,400
um and so really it came from our

509
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,240
networks is the simplest answer to that

510
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,400
uh these were people who many of them

511
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,279
were you know

512
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,519
uh friends of ours already certainly um

513
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,240
and already kind of tuned in to what we

514
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,240
wanted to do

515
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,080
some were um like craig reinerman right

516
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,119
who who starts off the book was was

517
00:17:54,079 --> 00:18:00,399
josh's uh dissertation advisor uh

518
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,439
at at um uc santa cruz

519
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,559
um

520
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,960
and craig is illuminary uh

521
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,359
wendy chapkis is someone that i followed

522
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,200
for a really long time and

523
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,279
i've taught her book and gotten to know

524
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,400
her basically by reaching out to her for

525
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,639
example and she's another superstar

526
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,840
in the public health section

527
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,600
and so

528
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,959
there weren't a whole lot of strangers

529
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,599
really

530
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,519
i'd say that

531
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,839
there were a number of people we reached

532
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,558
out to and

533
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,359
they

534
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,798
said no right uh we there were a number

535
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,439
of people we reached out to and they

536
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,200
said okay let's try it and and when

537
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,320
what they wanted to write kind of came

538
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,840
back

539
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,798
didn't fit what we wanted to do for the

540
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:47,359
book we kind of like

541
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,599
we either worked with them to come to an

542
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,678
understanding or let them

543
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,599
keep going so some of these were kind of

544
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,240
famous people

545
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,079
uh and i don't wanna bag on them so uh

546
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,599
and then then there was uh you know some

547
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:04,558
other folks that just kind of

548
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,319
let's say carl hart was very busy uh he

549
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,000
agreed to write a chapter and then there

550
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,759
were

551
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,200
just there was just a lot of a lot of

552
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,240
silence and kind of dropped the ball it

553
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,759
looked like he was relying on his

554
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,839
graduate students and so we just kind of

555
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,440
let that go yeah since his book came out

556
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,439
i can imagine the demand sign of his

557
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
time on his time have skyrocketed

558
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,000
absolutely and i really like this idea

559
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,519
that's coming you know clear that you

560
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,519
know you and josh mazel are area experts

561
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,160
you have both been doing this uh

562
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,960
teaching this at university level for

563
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,320
you know

564
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,079
like decades on your part i don't know

565
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,599
how old josh is but but you guys are

566
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,119
very much

567
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,959
area experts and discipline experts and

568
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,678
the two of you just worked together and

569
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,840
curated from all of the people they have

570
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,000
access to and and you chose the best of

571
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,959
the best who were you know also

572
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,119
interested so um so thank you for that

573
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,679
you know your your in your introduction

574
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,519
um co-written with josh um you say that

575
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,960
this book is intended to encourage

576
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,440
critical reason critical research

577
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,240
agendas that address the continuity of

578
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,919
prohibition in legal cannabis frameworks

579
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,000
as they remain entangled with the

580
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,000
continuum of global drug production

581
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,159
right very similar to what you said

582
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,319
during during our introduction today but

583
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,480
there's so much to unpack there right

584
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:22,079
but what piques my interest in that

585
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,480
heavy duty sentence is that no one

586
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,480
country's relaxation of cannabis laws

587
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,360
happens in isolation

588
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,279
countries are forever interdependent

589
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,798
even if they think

590
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,038
they're doing their own thing you and i

591
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,279
talked about that during episode one of

592
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,558
shaping fire when we talked about policy

593
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,720
transfer right

594
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,038
and this is especially true in regards

595
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,120
to the drug trade so let's start out

596
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,519
please talk to us a bit about how we are

597
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,319
seeing the global global dynamic of

598
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:54,240
cannabis production distribution and

599
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:57,918
prohibition shift around as countries

600
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,919
begin to embrace cannabis

601
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,159
yeah so i think that sense actually

602
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,038
ended with global drug prohibition but

603
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,039
production is is part of it so uh you

604
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:10,079
know

605
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,919
i think for example

606
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,960
you can look at uh you know the the

607
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,360
chapter on morocco by kenza of sahih

608
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,720
where basically they've been cultivating

609
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,038
cannabis

610
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,558
for thousands of years you know in that

611
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:23,359
area

612
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,200
and

613
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,719
the market for it

614
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,720
certainly has been you know they've

615
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,600
produced hash for example

616
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,440
for europeans for a long time

617
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:37,038
but it's only been in the last you know

618
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,279
maybe 20 years where basically um

619
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,480
genetics that were bred

620
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:45,440
you know generally by europeans and

621
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,759
and us americans uh

622
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,600
were taken to the moroccan fields right

623
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,919
which actually starts screwing with

624
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,599
their genetics and and at a very basic

625
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,120
level of course

626
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,678
what they had were land races that were

627
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,119
adapted their environment right and so

628
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,480
they were you know

629
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,798
resistant to whatever they needed to

630
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,679
resist there and

631
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,599
now with new you know genetics coming in

632
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,440
sometimes bred under conditions of

633
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,959
quasi-legality

634
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,480
um

635
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,360
uh sometimes not

636
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,120
but

637
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,038
generally speaking being brought in

638
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,038
because they want to feed the market on

639
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,119
the other end with something that that

640
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,798
that they've they've found

641
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,079
uh that market will prefer whether

642
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,679
that's you know europe or somewhere else

643
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,279
they bring in the genetics and it really

644
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,919
screws with

645
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,480
uh the basic agroecology

646
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,280
of you know moroccan cannabis

647
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,839
so

648
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,158
that's that's one example um

649
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,798
you can also

650
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,760
you can also think about

651
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,679
the opening up of of cannabis trade

652
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,919
internationally which hasn't happened to

653
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,159
the degree that i think some people

654
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,159
think

655
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,279
as of course being to affect

656
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,240
the livelihoods of folks who've been

657
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,960
producing cannabis in in other areas

658
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,960
um you know right now legally speaking

659
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,279
obviously uh colombia has done some

660
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,400
exporting right i think uruguay has and

661
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,599
i think both of those have been through

662
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,440
tilray

663
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,879
um

664
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,519
but

665
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,200
that's a shift towards kind of the the

666
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,879
the globalization that we've been

667
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,159
familiar with

668
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
you know

669
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,280
uh

670
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,558
around other commodities

671
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:29,440
you know for 30 40 years right the

672
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:32,158
supply chains that are

673
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,640
uh rely on cheap labor to produce a

674
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,480
low-cost product and get it to a market

675
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,520
that has money that will pay more money

676
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
for it

677
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,839
uh and so

678
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,480
that's sort of a mundane you know

679
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,158
problem with globalization

680
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,400
is that you know

681
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,000
labor gets screwed for example

682
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,000
uh in in the first world um

683
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,119
the the so-called first world

684
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,798
uh

685
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,399
but it's also kind of kind of funny

686
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,158
because

687
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,759
the drug war

688
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,520
did something during the age of

689
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,839
globalization which is kind of crazy

690
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,839
which is it was

691
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:09,599
anti-globalization we got domesticated

692
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,119
u.s markets

693
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,199
right uh we

694
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,000
the production that we used to import

695
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,720
from

696
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
mexico thailand colombia and elsewhere

697
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,640
uh has been displaced significantly and

698
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,798
you know starting about 20 years ago

699
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,880
pretty close to half of what what we

700
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,519
consume in this country

701
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,600
started being pretty much grown here

702
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,879
um and so

703
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,678
uh

704
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,559
there's a lot of kind of

705
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,038
counter-intuitive

706
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,639
you know explanations for what are what

707
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,599
what's going on and some of those

708
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,559
involve

709
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,599
applying critiques of globalization

710
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,558
to

711
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,839
critiques of globalizing weed right

712
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,599
um

713
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,918
and and some of them are

714
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,278
well then where does like you know

715
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,960
global prohibition come into it

716
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,240
and then you're then you're off down a

717
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,440
rabbit hole so um

718
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,960
obviously in countries that continue to

719
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,200
prohibit cannabis

720
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,000
it is much much harder for them

721
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
to

722
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,759
attempt to continue to do so

723
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,759
uh there's just a lot of product being

724
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,319
being moved around the world and in

725
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,679
different ways you have in peru

726
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:27,200
you know uh cannabis being grown

727
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:30,640
and processed into bho for example

728
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,640
um which has a higher you know price

729
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:37,120
per uh per weight than than uh cocaine

730
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,759
uh you know in lima

731
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,359
and so you're getting cultivation

732
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,919
practices shifting

733
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,759
from just coca out

734
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,120
out in the amazon area to coca and

735
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:51,839
cannabis and then uh you know

736
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,839
processing into the refined product

737
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:58,399
that's smaller and easier to smuggle

738
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:01,359
um and you know where does that go well

739
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,798
you know it goes to lima

740
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,719
uh

741
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,200
it probably isn't coming to the united

742
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,960
states um because we've had our

743
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,038
extraction game you know uh explosion

744
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,640
here already and there's a vast

745
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,200
oversupply of

746
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,080
you know for example bho in washington

747
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,919
um

748
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,079
so

749
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,520
those are just a few examples of what i

750
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,519
mean by that

751
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,720
i would think that this the the

752
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,480
patchwork

753
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,960
that you described that we're all aware

754
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,759
of in california really plays out the

755
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,798
same if you look at the global

756
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:39,919
uh presence as well and it must really

757
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,679
cause a whole bunch of odd imbalances

758
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,880
and contrasts

759
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,278
when you when when you know

760
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
countries as a pool

761
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,359
are both

762
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,000
holding on to traditional prohibition

763
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,959
that was pushed by the west

764
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,519
plus

765
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,519
now everybody wanting to

766
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,599
um you know increase

767
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:05,119
health with medical

768
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:07,119
and then also now this entrepreneurial

769
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,678
approach where people are trying to

770
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:12,639
commoditize cannabis and all three of

771
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,519
these are happening at the same time

772
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,559
and you know like um you know as you

773
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,879
know

774
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:24,000
these market inefficiencies must just be

775
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,200
um dazzling as a social researcher like

776
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,278
yourself

777
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,200
well yeah you know like uh i think

778
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,119
you're exactly right the the patchwork

779
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,038
quilt exists at the local level it

780
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,798
exists at the state level and by local i

781
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,558
mean city and county so there's

782
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,398
patchwork quilt upon patchwork quilt

783
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,278
upon patchwork quilt upon patchwork

784
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:40,719
quilt

785
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,119
uh you know

786
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,759
regionally north america globally

787
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,839
uh and so what i'd say that

788
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:51,038
it's almost like a logarithmically more

789
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:53,199
complex you know landscape

790
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,798
that regulators are faced with because

791
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,080
they're the ones who actually worry

792
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,079
about it uh quite a lot

793
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,880
and it's you know

794
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,880
it provides i think as you know

795
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,320
um

796
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,399
opportunities for

797
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,918
a lot of entrepreneurial

798
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,599
uh

799
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,600
activities that are different from and

800
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,839
scaled differently uh than we used to

801
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,319
have

802
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:20,639
um i think that uh

803
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,278
when you throw in the medical

804
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480
um regimes as well and and medical of

805
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,079
course is

806
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,960
uh

807
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,398
in there in that gray area

808
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,919
of the entanglement between prohibition

809
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,038
legalization

810
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,200
you know i mean

811
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,398
you have the the the full-throated

812
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,440
embrace of

813
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,879
cbd for example like uh globally uh very

814
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,440
very quickly

815
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,720
um and global supply chains for it and

816
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,640
and actually

817
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,600
in countries that are also pretty into

818
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,080
prohibition they're absolutely driving

819
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,240
cbd you know production and so forth

820
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,519
uh like china

821
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,599
let's remember that even though the us

822
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,278
has you know probably originated and

823
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,240
pushed this that there are definitely

824
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:01,519
other

825
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,159
significant

826
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,000
you know geopolitical entities that have

827
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,840
that are hanging onto prohibition uh and

828
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
they will probably hang on longer than

829
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,639
the u.s will you look at russia look at

830
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,079
look at the philippines uh yeah which is

831
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,640
an absolute

832
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:18,639
war crime situation going on there

833
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,360
so um

834
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,278
yeah it's uh it's pretty crazy and then

835
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,439
that to me says like there is so much

836
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,440
opportunity for research and research

837
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,120
that actually shows how complex and

838
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,360
difficult this is

839
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:33,038
when you're stacking regulations on top

840
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,879
of regulations

841
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,119
that you know

842
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,520
may seem to work locally usually they

843
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,278
don't but like when you zoom out a

844
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,359
little bit and

845
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,679
you have your oklahoma you know uh

846
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,759
situation uh you know

847
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,559
uh headed in a different direction than

848
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,398
your

849
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,839
your california and washington oregon

850
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:53,359
situations

851
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,119
uh

852
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,798
so

853
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,079
it's it's pretty crazy of course what

854
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,000
does that mean it means that you know

855
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,038
oklahoma is a place where

856
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,359
a lot of people went to

857
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,119
uh you know become entrepreneurs that

858
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,398
then they can

859
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,319
they're not just selling it locally

860
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,599
right the same as same as the west coast

861
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,839
uh you know

862
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,839
uh even today but uh for washington

863
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,759
oregon or for washington maybe it was

864
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,798
you know eight years ago oregon still

865
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,558
exports but like oklahoma

866
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,519
has become an export

867
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:28,720
like a thc exporting state you know

868
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,720
uh which is crazy

869
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,399
so so your work and what we've been

870
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,558
talking about so far you've been talking

871
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,558
about teasing apart prohibition and

872
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,359
legalization because somehow they're

873
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,678
both existing at the same time

874
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,000
and and and i'd like to look at an

875
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,159
example from northern california where

876
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,240
cannabis cultivators went from working

877
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,679
in the medical gray and export markets

878
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,519
during prohibition

879
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,519
to a new kind of prohibition that's

880
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,038
actually being pushed by licensed

881
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,278
cannabis companies trying to protect

882
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,640
their markets from unlicensed producers

883
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:02,240
to the point that

884
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,000
you know folks are

885
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,720
you know licensed producers are suing

886
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,798
the state for not stomping out

887
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,519
the their competitors in the unlicensed

888
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,278
market either way growing cannabis and

889
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,519
minding your own business is still

890
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,119
experienced as prohibition as law

891
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,960
enforcement showing up with you know

892
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,918
wood chippers and to destroy family

893
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,919
crops

894
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,320
um is it even fair to call what we are

895
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,038
seeing today as legalization or are we

896
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,278
just using that word because it's the

897
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,359
closest thing that we've got

898
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,720
well i think you have to define the term

899
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,519
and define how you're using it and we

900
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,880
define it very very clearly in the

901
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,759
introduction

902
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,760
uh legalization is

903
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,640
the uh

904
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,119
the licensing and regulation of a supply

905
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,840
chain from cedar clone to consumer

906
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,839
basically um and

907
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,720
if you have that you've got a form of

908
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,798
legalization so it's it's do you have a

909
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,640
carved out space

910
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,519
uh whether or not you still prohibit it

911
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,880
you know in other ways where

912
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,919
cannabis can

913
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,679
travel entirely under circumstances that

914
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,799
are that are regulated and supposedly

915
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,320
tracked

916
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,200
so uh

917
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,119
so we we got this by the way from

918
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,159
harry levine in particular who who

919
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:21,038
defined it uh years ago with respect to

920
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,440
amsterdam back in 2004

921
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,839
uh which amsterdam of course didn't

922
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,038
actually have legalization either

923
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,038
it was

924
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,599
the supply side of it wasn't regulated

925
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,599
and the consumption side of it was

926
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,038
uh but levine had had begun to think

927
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,079
about well what is legalization at that

928
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,119
point and

929
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,519
it's it's to me you know it is is the

930
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:44,000
carving out of these supply chains that

931
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,038
are governed or at least supposed to be

932
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,839
governed

933
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,679
from the beginning to the end use

934
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,480
uh and so

935
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,159
that can happen that's actually

936
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,640
let's let's blow our readers minds

937
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,159
that's been happening since the 1970s in

938
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,519
the united states

939
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,000
right uh with the university of

940
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,720
mississippi and the um

941
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,720
investigative new drug program right so

942
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,640
there was a legal supply chain of

943
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,480
federally legal cannabis that went from

944
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,519
the university of mississippi

945
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,960
to medical patients like lv musica right

946
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,159
robert randall

947
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,919
um

948
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,679
and it was entirely legal so we've had

949
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,080
legalization united states since the

950
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,038
1970s let's let's be real clear about

951
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,079
that

952
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,319
um at the federal level and of course

953
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,079
that's still uh there's still a couple

954
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,038
patients still in that

955
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,038
so

956
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,720
once you think about that then you don't

957
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,640
think well legalization is not actually

958
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,880
a brand new thing

959
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,038
right it's it's existed before but we

960
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,960
didn't recognize it

961
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,359
because prohibition was sort of an

962
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,798
overwhelming fact total fact total

963
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,959
social fact

964
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,000
uh and so

965
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,278
uh

966
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,119
i'd like to make sure that we're

967
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,599
defining legalization i think that's an

968
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:58,398
issue in the media and with a lot of

969
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:01,759
other like policy scholars

970
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:04,079
they just assume legalization is

971
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,440
its own thing uh

972
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,679
and

973
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,679
uh it leads them to i think um

974
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,439
research agendas that are in that are

975
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,639
that often just kind of reproduce common

976
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,559
sense uh to be honest instead of instead

977
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,639
of actually anything new well with with

978
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,759
this very specific definition of

979
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,240
legalization it actually is a very small

980
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,399
niche and the word legalization does not

981
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,039
say very much about the overall

982
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:36,159
landscape it really only speaks to a

983
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,878
very small portion of the you know

984
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,878
cannabis legalization how it's used

985
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,799
casually right

986
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,960
absolutely and let me let me just jump

987
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,359
in real quick like that's absolutely the

988
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,960
case and and one of the one of the ways

989
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,119
this happens over and over and over

990
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,838
again are those maps of the united

991
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,240
states that are color coded for

992
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,199
legal state and you know

993
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,319
uh

994
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,919
cbd only and and well

995
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,800
usually there's there's like a legal

996
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,320
medical and and neither right right and

997
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,480
and it looks like okay

998
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,160
oh california and all these these states

999
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,559
are entirely green

1000
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,480
it's just legal and so

1001
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,480
as but actually if you broke that up by

1002
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,119
jurisdictions california would look a

1003
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,719
lot more like a patchwork quilt

1004
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,320
and so people just kind of assume oh

1005
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,838
there's freedom there we've got the

1006
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,559
liberty we won

1007
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,000
and

1008
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:29,519
actually it's just a big mess

1009
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,440
so what are your thoughts on the rural

1010
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,039
militarization of law enforcement in the

1011
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,800
emerald triangle right like you know you

1012
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,039
and i have talked before both on this

1013
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,720
show and personally about just the the

1014
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,639
general militarization of law

1015
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,399
enforcement everywhere

1016
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,480
but you know almost daily we're seeing

1017
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,400
clips on social media of heavily armed

1018
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,320
officers and military transports just

1019
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
tearing through the unpaved roads of

1020
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,559
humboldt how can this not be seen as

1021
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,800
simply an extension of the campaign

1022
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,440
against marijuana planting camp of the

1023
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,519
90s and early 2000s it's like it's like

1024
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,200
yeah

1025
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:03,599
legalization exists meaning that there's

1026
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,598
this there's this path for the the

1027
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,800
growing and distribution of taxed

1028
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,400
licensed cannabis but at the same time

1029
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,640
you know people

1030
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,559
who you know heritage growers who are in

1031
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:17,519
california their situation has not

1032
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,519
changed all that much

1033
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,879
so

1034
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,760
let me address that because it's

1035
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,240
actually a really great question for for

1036
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,680
saying uh something for for a while here

1037
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:31,118
and if you'll indulge me please um

1038
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,440
one of that is that reminds me of your

1039
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,519
earlier comments about uh you know legal

1040
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,079
businesses you know suing the state for

1041
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,960
not enforcing um

1042
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,640
against unregulated ones and and let me

1043
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,720
say there's a geography to that and is

1044
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,039
in particular in southern california

1045
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,559
uh and what they usually mean are

1046
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,039
actually you know

1047
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,519
storefronts retail storefronts

1048
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,358
uh and so

1049
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:57,440
often really the case is in southern

1050
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,838
california the places that are

1051
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,400
relatively high density with

1052
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,400
legal retail um

1053
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,880
what they are trying to get people to do

1054
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,119
is you know enforce against

1055
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,400
uh you know unlicensed storefronts that

1056
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,440
that pop up

1057
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,280
um

1058
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,200
and you know

1059
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,960
that is a can of worms itself right

1060
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,799
because those unlicensed storefronts are

1061
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,559
generally speaking

1062
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,400
demographically underrepresented

1063
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:23,838
populations in the legal landscape

1064
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,599
because it's white rich people that have

1065
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:26,799
been able to get these other types of

1066
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,680
licenses

1067
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,480
now

1068
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,480
eradication is the is the rural version

1069
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,639
of urban enforcement let's say that

1070
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,639
right

1071
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:40,719
um i think what people don't

1072
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,879
necessarily understand

1073
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,919
is that

1074
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:50,760
in humboldt and elsewhere

1075
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,760
over the course of the 1980s and 1990s

1076
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,800
local law enforcement

1077
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,358
backed off

1078
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,239
from being

1079
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:04,000
you know i think uh gung-ho participants

1080
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,159
in in camp although they continue to do

1081
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,559
that

1082
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,399
there was an informal

1083
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,559
regulation

1084
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,160
pattern going on which is to say that

1085
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,320
law enforcement

1086
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,358
would stay out of certain neighborhoods

1087
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,760
maybe they would have uh you know maybe

1088
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,239
they they would you know

1089
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,240
um

1090
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,679
they would uh you know

1091
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,559
there was a size and this and a scope of

1092
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,639
operations that were

1093
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:35,679
more or less just kind of left alone

1094
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,279
right

1095
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,559
because they weren't hurting anybody and

1096
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,200
you're talking about rural law

1097
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:43,358
enforcement and rural law enforcement is

1098
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,279
is not really out there to bug the

1099
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,639
sparsely populated uh folks you don't

1100
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,720
have neighbors complaining because it

1101
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,118
was all in remote areas

1102
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,399
they get left alone right

1103
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,838
um

1104
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,559
meanwhile of course you know camp would

1105
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,000
come around by the season and uh

1106
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,799
generally speaking

1107
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,599
as time went on with camp they started

1108
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,760
focusing more and more on on larger

1109
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,838
scale operations

1110
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,280
uh that

1111
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:10,960
sometimes were environmentally

1112
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,240
destructive

1113
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,000
and over time this this was definitely

1114
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:18,319
evident you know when when i first got

1115
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,239
the humble in 2009

1116
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,280
over time a lot of those old timers and

1117
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:25,358
small cannabis growers that since 96 had

1118
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,880
been you know

1119
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,119
not that afraid but especially like

1120
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,559
after 2001 like not too worried about

1121
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,119
their small gardens

1122
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,199
were absolutely up in arms about what

1123
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,800
they called the greed growers

1124
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,078
and large-scale environmentally

1125
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,079
destructive cultivation

1126
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,599
at the same time

1127
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,520
whenever policing that was maybe

1128
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,240
intended for that would catch up a

1129
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,159
heritage farmer in its net

1130
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,118
which you know is almost inevitable

1131
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,559
really

1132
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,559
um

1133
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,400
that you know the collateral damage of

1134
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,759
uh you know focusing on larger scale

1135
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,920
operations

1136
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,359
uh you know that would be pretty awful

1137
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,280
and and the old-timers would be you know

1138
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,440
totally against that but

1139
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,920
they also were kind of interested in you

1140
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,920
know like

1141
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,920
they didn't want the large-scale

1142
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,680
environmentally impactful cultivation in

1143
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,039
their backyards and it wasn't just

1144
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,318
because it was environmentally impactful

1145
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,599
it was also driving down the price of

1146
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,679
their cannabis

1147
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,400
uh because they were flooding the market

1148
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:25,039
right so um

1149
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,358
so the the enforcement situation today

1150
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,400
is absolutely the continuation of camp

1151
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,838
but

1152
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,480
it's important to remember that that

1153
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:37,039
camp changed over time

1154
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,800
uh and often in directions that i think

1155
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,119
you know heritage farmers had no problem

1156
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,519
with and in fact cheered on and i think

1157
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,559
some of that is happening today

1158
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,318
but

1159
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,838
really the smaller farmers are being hit

1160
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,199
by code enforcement

1161
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:53,039
more than by eradication like uh their

1162
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,118
issues are now with

1163
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,279
civil code enforcement

1164
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,920
that do you mean like do you mean like

1165
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,359
the satellites being used to see

1166
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,318
greenhouses that are not supposed to be

1167
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,159
growing

1168
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,639
cannabis and so they just start hitting

1169
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,639
them with fines before they even bother

1170
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,480
sending in swat teams that's right

1171
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,799
that's right all right yeah and and that

1172
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,760
certainly i think is uh you know

1173
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,039
the satellites really changed that game

1174
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,880
yeah sure the satellites did um it's a

1175
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:26,318
pretty expensive program mendocino is

1176
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,318
next up for one of those um

1177
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:31,358
but like

1178
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:33,920
there's a 1991 article by joe lieber in

1179
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,318
like the humble geographic with a map

1180
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,800
that like

1181
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:41,599
has a pretty damn detailed

1182
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,640
depiction of where and how many

1183
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,240
canvas plants are in the entire county

1184
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:47,838
and so like

1185
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,919
there's a way in which actually like

1186
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,759
they've always been seen

1187
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,200
um the question is whether they're left

1188
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,480
alone or not

1189
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,239
uh and to what use like where does that

1190
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,920
information go well it used to go to law

1191
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,199
enforcement but now it goes also to code

1192
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,400
enforcement

1193
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,799
and code enforcement is is

1194
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,800
you know

1195
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,480
it is a part of civil government that is

1196
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,480
you know

1197
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,560
not always you know connected to the

1198
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,119
broader maybe county vision of trying to

1199
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,039
protect its citizens by its nature code

1200
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,039
enforcement is

1201
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,800
out there to weed out the wrong types

1202
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,719
right uh the people you don't want in

1203
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,839
your neighborhood the people with their

1204
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,759
you know uh

1205
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,519
if they're you know maybe there's

1206
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,000
abandoned cars on their property you

1207
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,880
know maybe their house isn't up to code

1208
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,039
um

1209
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,640
you know code enforcement is really a

1210
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,639
form of law enforcement against poor

1211
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,118
people usually

1212
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,118
and so

1213
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,559
this is

1214
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,719
kind of different in rural areas than is

1215
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,358
in urban areas but it's been real

1216
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,959
significant across the landscape i mean

1217
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:58,880
you have

1218
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,800
sonoma county let's say

1219
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,039
right which largely accommodated medical

1220
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,280
cannabis and commercial medical medical

1221
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,480
cannabis uh at that

1222
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,960
um

1223
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,199
in 2013

1224
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,079
you know doing a joint task force you

1225
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:16,799
know raid on uh

1226
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,240
uh mostly hispanic uh you know

1227
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,039
neighborhood

1228
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,559
uh

1229
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:24,239
called roselands right it's 33 houses um

1230
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,239
you know and you look at what they got

1231
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,239
and it only ended up with under three

1232
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,598
pounds a house and under it's about six

1233
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,279
hundred dollars

1234
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,200
both of which were not really you know

1235
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,040
an issue for the white people

1236
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,598
right um

1237
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,599
uh they were being left alone

1238
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,318
uh you know you have the city of clear

1239
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,440
lake which actually um at the onset of

1240
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:47,679
the financial crisis in 2007

1241
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,119
defunded code enforcement entirely

1242
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:50,639
because they were broke

1243
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,400
and for like six years you know they

1244
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,719
didn't have code enforcement

1245
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,480
and clear lake is

1246
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:00,000
a very very very poor town there's

1247
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,280
demographically more in common with like

1248
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,480
a a city in the uh appalachians you know

1249
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,160
to the east

1250
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,519
than it is the you know state of

1251
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,879
california

1252
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,800
um

1253
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,119
and what happened was like you know city

1254
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,400
of ten thousand you know

1255
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,838
probably half of the houses had

1256
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,519
backyards full of cannabis being

1257
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:18,559
cultivated basically right out there in

1258
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,358
the open

1259
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,920
so they once they recovered from

1260
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,358
their budget recovered uh in 2014 they

1261
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,800
reactivated code enforcement

1262
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,039
specifically

1263
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,560
to deal with their uh you know so-called

1264
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,800
problem the the backyard cannabis

1265
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,480
cultivation problem which certainly

1266
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,920
had some negative effects and had

1267
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,000
negative effects associated with it

1268
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,039
let's let's you know

1269
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,039
let's say that uh

1270
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,480
the ripoffs are a pretty good example

1271
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:47,920
of you know something bad that can

1272
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,119
happen when cannabis is being grown

1273
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,119
entirely out in the open under

1274
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,039
conditions of prohibition yeah valuable

1275
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,960
crops they're right there for the taking

1276
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,639
and that stuff gets violent fast often

1277
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,119
and that stuff gets violent fast right

1278
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,639
exactly so the the landscape now is

1279
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:05,519
certainly

1280
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:07,039
yes you know camp is is out there um

1281
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,599
campus is

1282
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:12,960
and not just camp but local uh joint

1283
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,000
task forces as well

1284
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,000
and

1285
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,719
depending on where you are

1286
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,760
they may be concentrating on

1287
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:25,598
large environmentally impactful you know

1288
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,839
cultivation sites uh that that

1289
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,599
are politically you know probably more

1290
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:32,559
agreeable to a lot of legacy campus

1291
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,559
farmers um but they're also

1292
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,799
you know catching up certainly

1293
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,480
uh and causing collateral damage for

1294
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,480
smaller farmers

1295
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,039
uh so

1296
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,358
it's complex but it was always complex i

1297
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,599
guess the short summary of this long

1298
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,078
answer is that yes it's light camp but

1299
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,160
camp isn't necessarily

1300
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,400
something that was the same like the 80s

1301
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,679
and 90s were really it's it's it's

1302
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,838
gung-ho

1303
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,440
uh you know hit the small people

1304
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,318
you know uh

1305
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,679
um political you know thing there's a

1306
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:04,800
there's a

1307
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,039
sense in which camp kind of

1308
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,039
professionalized a little bit over time

1309
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,400
uh and

1310
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:12,159
uh

1311
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,358
and also justifies funding by getting

1312
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,358
plant counts so they weren't as

1313
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:16,159
incentivized to go after smaller growers

1314
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:17,920
so

1315
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:18,879
you know whether it was a moral decision

1316
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,880
or not

1317
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,960
it became

1318
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,079
uh you know more profitable for them to

1319
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,480
go after

1320
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,720
a very large-scale cultivation

1321
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,400
right on so let me reintroduce you

1322
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,239

protect and monetize

1333
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,318
you'll likely want legal representation

1334
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,440
that is experienced accessible and

1335
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,838

researcher dr dominic corva

1480
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,040
so you know chapter four of the book you

1481
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,879
edited with josh mizell begins with a

1482
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,960
provocative quote from oregon state

1483
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,800
representative diane russell who said

1484
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,880
that the conversation about who makes

1485
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,280
the profits off this industry is

1486
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,838
irrelevant she said this as a way to try

1487
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,599
to focus activists on getting any

1488
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,759
legalization passed in the state of

1489
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,240
maine rather than nitpicking the

1490
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,160
particular policy choices but as we've

1491
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:33,039
all seen in california

1492
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,639
prop 64 was immediately a slippery piece

1493
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,039
of legislation that quickly became

1494
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:39,519
weaponized and then with the removal of

1495
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:41,759
the one acre cap that was promised the

1496
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,599
entire market you know tilted towards

1497
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,079
large industrial producers distributing

1498
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,720
mediocre cannabis and driving prices

1499
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:51,680
down to a point where the heritage

1500
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,919
market has just been decimated and we

1501
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:55,838
see this happening in one way or another

1502
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,119
in nearly every state that is normalized

1503
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,199
so far

1504
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,440
and as we see these multi-state

1505
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:03,439
operators weave their brands across the

1506
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,400
country state by state the future looks

1507
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,440
very exasperating for smaller heritage

1508
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,920
players

1509
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,280
what are your thoughts on who is making

1510
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,680
profits now and into the future versus

1511
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,240
how these laws were originally sold to

1512
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:18,239
the public

1513
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,039
well i think the public didn't care to

1514
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:28,960
be honest who it was that was supplying

1515
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:30,558
the cannabis uh to a large degree so

1516
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,240
uh certainly not the part of the public

1517
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,760
that needed to be convinced about

1518
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:36,000
legalization

1519
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,359
necessarily a a lot of folks who just

1520
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,838
wanted easier access to cannabis

1521
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,759
and i think access historically has been

1522
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:47,199
culturally determined

1523
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,520
you it's your friend you know that is

1524
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:50,558
into cannabis and you know maybe comes

1525
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,280
from

1526
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,559
uh a place where where it's around a lot

1527
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,880
uh maybe it's your friend that's a

1528
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,960
grower um

1529
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,680
it's it has been difficult for something

1530
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,720
i remember a seattle journalist uh years

1531
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:04,879
ago

1532
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,399
uh happy that he could just go to a

1533
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,119
store because his dealer was so

1534
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,559
unreliable before um

1535
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,160
and so

1536
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,079
let's just say that the people voting

1537
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,078
for legalization or at least the the

1538
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,680
voting bloc that mattered definitely

1539
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,559
were not the cannabis culture people

1540
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:22,159
they're very very very tiny percentage

1541
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,599
of the population

1542
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:25,358
um

1543
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,240
and literally they were going to vote

1544
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:27,598
for

1545
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:29,439
legalization

1546
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:33,039
you know wherever

1547
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:35,599
so first of all i don't think that um

1548
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:38,719
legalization was sold originally

1549
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,640
as an economic justice thing that

1550
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:42,078
conversation has shifted

1551
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,239
tremendously

1552
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,318
in the last eight years

1553
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:49,358
um and primarily because of the black

1554
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:51,679
lives matter movement and the uh the way

1555
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:53,358
that that particular social movement

1556
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:55,440
has highlighted

1557
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:57,920
uh the the whiteness and richness

1558
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,159
essentially of ownership in

1559
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,400
the cannabis industry but let's talk

1560
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:04,078
about that let's talk about what that

1561
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,599
actually means

1562
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,760
when you refer to multi-state operators

1563
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,000
we're usually talking about um operators

1564
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,160
who are getting their funding

1565
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,199
from being listed on the canadian stock

1566
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:14,480
exchange

1567
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,480
usually

1568
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,039
um

1569
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,798
and so who's making money

1570
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,798
well

1571
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,798
none of those msos are actually making

1572
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,400
money or very very few of them what

1573
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:28,719
they're doing is losing money until

1574
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,838
their competitors can go out of business

1575
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:31,519
that is

1576
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:35,279
a tried and true

1577
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:36,639
you know uh you know uh

1578
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,640
method in the united states that

1579
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,558
especially developed you know since you

1580
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,759
know silicon valley uh and the tech

1581
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,400
sector

1582
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,400
that all you had to do was scale up and

1583
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,160
and and buy everybody and it didn't

1584
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,680
matter if you lost money you could

1585
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:51,118
always go back to the stock exchange and

1586
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,440
raise more money

1587
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,480
uh until basically you could go in into

1588
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,000
the green

1589
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,480
and i don't know how many tech companies

1590
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,159
lost money you know or even continuing

1591
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,240
to lose money today

1592
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:05,838
uh whose ceos and founders are making

1593
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:08,558
you know tens of millions hundreds of

1594
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:11,838
millions of dollars while they do this

1595
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,798
so the companies aren't making money

1596
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:15,519
but

1597
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:17,519
the ceos and the founders and their

1598
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,798
officers are making money because

1599
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:19,838
they're being paid like corporate

1600
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:21,199
america

1601
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:23,599
right like

1602
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,039
what do you pay a ceo a ceo in the

1603
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,119
united states well usually it's

1604
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,838
something absolutely ridiculous

1605
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,039
because that's what

1606
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:32,719
essentially uh you know

1607
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,400
early 21st century financialized

1608
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:36,399
capitalism has done

1609
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,838
it's created enormous inequality in

1610
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,760
terms of income

1611
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,759
uh and and the people who are kind of

1612
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,040
sitting at the bottleneck just like you

1613
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,920
know

1614
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:47,838
uh extracting you know

1615
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,920
uh what would be an enormous amount of

1616
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,239
money to any other individual while

1617
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,838
their company loses money

1618
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:55,358
uh you know those are the people getting

1619
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:56,719
rich and they tend to be white and they

1620
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:58,880
tend to be male that's absolutely the

1621
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:59,679
case so

1622
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,039
it

1623
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:05,440
in in the cannabis energy industry

1624
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,880
the media part of it really has fallen

1625
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,159
down about this

1626
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,160
because

1627
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,598
so many people want to talk about how

1628
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,759
much money is being made how much

1629
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,359
revenue is being made in cannabis

1630
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,440
and of course like that's a stupid

1631
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:18,960
question how much money is being made in

1632
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,639
cannabis

1633
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,240
means nothing

1634
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,679
if you balance it with well how much is

1635
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,439
it costing us

1636
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,759
to actually make that money right

1637
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,400
because that's where you end up you know

1638
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,839
uh with net revenue losses even though

1639
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,280
you're you're raking in millions and

1640
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:34,798
millions of dollars that just means

1641
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,119
you've got a lot of sales

1642
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:38,639
but you had to spend money to get there

1643
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,760
and so

1644
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:43,759
ultimately it's the large msos

1645
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,839
that you know can lose money but while

1646
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,520
small businesses can absolutely not do

1647
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:48,558
that right

1648
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,920
um

1649
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,680
they will go out of business they will

1650
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,000
get uh

1651
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:56,159
acquired in fact that's probably the

1652
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,760
strategy of a lot of folks who actually

1653
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:58,719
did transition to legalization at this

1654
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,640
point

1655
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,639
is they've been barely getting by

1656
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:05,358
or

1657
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,559
not at all

1658
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,078
and

1659
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,359
they're positioning their businesses to

1660
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,640
get acquired so they can get out of this

1661
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:11,838
because they didn't sign up for

1662
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,440
basically

1663
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,199
a you know

1664
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,679
a business model that was absolutely no

1665
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,639
fun and had actually no you know reward

1666
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:20,798
to it

1667
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,558
uh and so

1668
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:24,880
really they you know most of them got

1669
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,640
into cannabis to get out of the rat race

1670
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,160
right and so legalization puts them

1671
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:30,719
right back in the rat race and and

1672
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:32,239
nobody wants to be a rat racing around

1673
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,399
so

1674
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,479
this is a you know

1675
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,480
this is a an interesting question across

1676
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,318
the landscape but it's that that like

1677
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,920
popular assumption that anybody who

1678
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:43,039
starts a cannabis business must be

1679
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,039
loaded

1680
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,279
that is a problem and it's entirely

1681
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:49,039
because of all the ipo pumping

1682
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,599
that's been going on

1683
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:53,519
uh you know the the media really is all

1684
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,559
about celebrating how much revenue comes

1685
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:58,880
in and they have absolutely no you know

1686
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,880
on the other hand

1687
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,519
uh these are the costs of doing business

1688
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,200
and we don't get to you know deduct them

1689
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:07,358
uh you know when we pay our taxes

1690
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,798
because cannabis is still illegal

1691
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:10,078
so

1692
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:12,960
uh

1693
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,798
that's an issue in a couple of ways and

1694
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,880
i'd say that

1695
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,798
it gets real messy when you start

1696
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,400
talking about a lot of these equity

1697
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:22,719
programs

1698
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,720
that

1699
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:25,279
are

1700
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,599
you know

1701
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,000
oriented towards diversifying ownership

1702
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,920
in the cannabis industry

1703
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,199
because being an owner in the cannabis

1704
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,318
industry

1705
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:37,439
is not the reward for

1706
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:39,679
uh you know

1707
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,519
someone who is not a corporation

1708
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,679
that you would expect right like it's an

1709
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:45,679
invitation to go bankrupt

1710
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,679
um and so like

1711
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:50,078
we both have this problem that yes too

1712
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:52,078
many white people are owners

1713
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,720
uh but especially too many white people

1714
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,160
are ceos right of these large companies

1715
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,639
and too many companies are in fact just

1716
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,639
these giant financial conglomerations

1717
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:02,639
that are you know

1718
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,000
just whales trying to swallow all the

1719
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:05,039
smaller whales until they're the biggest

1720
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,199
whale

1721
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:07,199
so

1722
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,200
that's a problem and that problem is

1723
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,558
almost entirely produced by

1724
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:14,719
the you know

1725
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,720
levels of regulation that are required

1726
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,399
that you can lose a bunch of money and

1727
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:19,679
just you know pay those costs of

1728
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,318
regulation

1729
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,679
and upkeep and unpredictability in the

1730
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:26,558
marketplace

1731
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,679
uh if you have access to essentially a

1732
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,839
you know

1733
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:32,399
a revenue source that is you know a

1734
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:33,599
public stock exchange you just sell more

1735
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,838
shares

1736
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,000
uh and so

1737
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:38,719
the shareholders themselves also you

1738
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,480
know

1739
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:41,679
have essentially

1740
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,280
bought little pieces of something that

1741
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,399
they hope will eventually become big

1742
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,519
pieces

1743
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,119
right uh and so they themselves may

1744
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:52,079
eventually

1745
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:53,680
uh you know cash out too so let's let's

1746
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,400
acknowledge that shareholders are also

1747
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:57,919
part of this landscape

1748
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,119
what's the demographic of this the

1749
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,119
shareholders right uh well

1750
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,480
there should be more research on that uh

1751
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,318
i think that's it would be an important

1752
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,920
thing that

1753
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:09,599
to uncover really is is how

1754
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,838
financialized is

1755
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,359
the cannabis industry

1756
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:15,119
and what are the demographics of that

1757
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:17,759
financialization

1758
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,720
uh so who really is making a bunch of

1759
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,240
money

1760
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:23,358
uh and and why and when the answer is

1761
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:25,679
well they're making a bunch of money

1762
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:28,078
because they're doing exactly what

1763
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:29,118
capitalism in the united states and and

1764
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,798
elsewhere

1765
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,039
you know uh

1766
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:34,239
incentivizes them to do

1767
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:36,719
and then you're like well how do we

1768
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:36,719
change this

1769
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,079
think about that for a sec well if the

1770
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,400
problem is actually existing capitalism

1771
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,640
then

1772
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,318
maybe the issue is going to be you're

1773
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:49,759
going to do something about

1774
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:52,239
capitalism let me let me actually break

1775
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,880
that down so it's not as vague by

1776
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:57,118
capitalism let me refer to you know the

1777
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,559
financialized sector

1778
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,920
of our

1779
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,280
gdp

1780
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,838
uh let us separate out the capitalism of

1781
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,440
small businesses and

1782
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:10,400
entrepreneurs uh and and livelihood

1783
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,599
operators who are also

1784
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,519
if you you know depending on how you're

1785
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,920
defining capitalism is for example you

1786
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:17,280
know using waged labor right

1787
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,599
uh you know they're practicing

1788
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,000
capitalism but they aren't practicing

1789
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,838
the kind of capitalism that operates

1790
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,400
through stock exchanges

1791
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:30,639
uh and when you have these regulations

1792
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,160
the regulations work just fine for you

1793
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:33,759
know

1794
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:35,358
they're a small barrier for a

1795
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,200
financialized company

1796
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:39,679
relative to the kind of barrier they are

1797
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,759
for small businesses so

1798
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,279
if you don't want to be like me uh and

1799
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,119
and you know

1800
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,079
throw all of capitalism under under a

1801
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,440
bus

1802
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,079
you know it'd be good to kind of think

1803
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,280
about this in terms of well

1804
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,839
what do

1805
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,359
regulations do in terms of you know

1806
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:57,759
business competition

1807
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:59,358
uh business competition and ownership uh

1808
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,880
considerations

1809
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,480
uh well

1810
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,240
in the rest of the united states what it

1811
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,760
does is it concentrates ownership in the

1812
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,479
hands of the few

1813
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,599
and and wrecks small businesses

1814
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,838
uh

1815
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,160
makes it very difficult uh

1816
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:16,400
high you know heavy regulations are very

1817
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:17,358
difficult for small business owners to

1818
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,119
to

1819
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,400
deal with

1820
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,720
but they are not really much of a

1821
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,480
barrier for highly capitalized interests

1822
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,239
so you have this kind of

1823
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,159
ambivalent thing going on here is we

1824
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:30,078
need

1825
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:33,199
big regulations for big business and

1826
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:35,440
small regulations for small business

1827
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,759
is is probably the most sensible way to

1828
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,519
to uh to think about that

1829
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,640
uh but

1830
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:43,119
you know

1831
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:44,480
we really aren't set up in the society

1832
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,960
to uh

1833
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,318
to think that way we're set up to think

1834
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,880
oh there's either regulations or no

1835
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:52,639
regulations well actually if you want to

1836
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,519
democratize uh

1837
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:57,920
the economy and maybe do a little work

1838
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:59,599
on economic justice what you would do is

1839
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,119
have big regulations for big business

1840
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,119
and small regulations for small business

1841
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:07,919
i want to tease out one particular

1842
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:10,078
demographic that that you're talking

1843
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,599
about here um

1844
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,079
be patient with me this is kind of a big

1845
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,359
setup so so you were just telling us

1846
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,318
about how

1847
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:17,119
um

1848
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:19,119
the

1849
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,838
these these large cannabis companies

1850
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:24,160
that are creating a lot of revenue but

1851
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,759
not actually necessarily profit because

1852
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:26,719
they're spending so much money but they

1853
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,000
are

1854
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:31,279
paying their executive suite um

1855
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,318
members

1856
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:36,798
um they are they are able to take on

1857
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:38,719
more and more debt by selling at a

1858
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:42,798
profit until

1859
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:45,358
the their competition uh including um

1860
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:47,920
smaller financialized companies and the

1861
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,558
entirety of the craft artisan market you

1862
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:53,599
know the heritage folks until they are

1863
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,480
all just you know crushed and go out of

1864
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,798
business

1865
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,000
or as you mentioned get picked up and

1866
01:04:56,798 --> 01:04:59,358
we're starting to see some of the

1867
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,679
heritage brands that have been

1868
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:03,759
successful starting to ally with some of

1869
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:05,838
these distributors you know potentially

1870
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,000
setting up a you know a future buy but

1871
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:11,038
you know we'll see how that goes out

1872
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:15,679
i'm very interested in the

1873
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:18,079
vast majority of heritage growers who

1874
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:20,639
are actually buckling under the weight

1875
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,400
of the low prices and the fact that they

1876
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:25,199
are not they don't have the same

1877
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,559
efficiencies of scale that some of these

1878
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:28,399
industrial agriculture cannabis

1879
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,480
producers have

1880
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,039
what happens when

1881
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,838
their backs are finally broken in the

1882
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,680
licensed

1883
01:05:34,838 --> 01:05:40,078
system and and they're all like you know

1884
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:41,838
what screw this i'm not playing in the

1885
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,519
license system i gotta interrupt you

1886
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:47,440
shango like if

1887
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:49,358
you've gone really staticky oh all right

1888
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,679
all right let's uh let's figure out what

1889
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:53,358
that is um

1890
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:55,598
hold on let me figure out where we are

1891
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:56,598
we're at um

1892
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,280
time-wise

1893
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:03,400
58-36 all right so what it what has

1894
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,400
changed and when did it change

1895
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:08,159
are you there

1896
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,240
yeah yeah yeah um

1897
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:11,759
was i i couldn't hear your entire

1898
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:14,000
question because you were going in and

1899
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,119
out all right um

1900
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,119
is it staticky now

1901
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:21,519
testing last sentence yeah so so no

1902
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:23,519
static all right so maybe what i did

1903
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,280
let's try something let me turn my head

1904
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:28,400
this way is this what was happening can

1905
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,240
you now hear me less well

1906
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,079
no you're just kind of quiet now before

1907
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:34,719
it was literally staticky you'd go in

1908
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,640
and out all right well um

1909
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:38,078
uh i guess i will

1910
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:39,920
let's i guess we'll we can just blame

1911
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,680
that on the internet i guess

1912
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,119
yeah yeah it might have been a burp

1913
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:44,960
you're sounding good now maybe maybe

1914
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,400
just start that question yeah i will

1915
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,199
start that question from the top cool

1916
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,798
thanks

1917
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:51,199
um

1918
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:52,559
um all right uh so there'll be a moment

1919
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:55,358
for me to edit into and i'll restart

1920
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,359
your question okay

1921
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,599
there's one group in that demographic

1922
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,039
that i really would like to tease out

1923
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,798
and and

1924
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,480
you know be patient with me because this

1925
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:07,519
this question takes a moment to set up

1926
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,760
because you pointed out how

1927
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:12,639
the large cap

1928
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,559
cannabis corporations are

1929
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:16,159
financialized and they are

1930
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,760
they're they have a lot of revenue

1931
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:19,679
coming in but they're actually losing

1932
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,039
money but they're okay with that because

1933
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:23,279
their goal

1934
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:26,160
is like you said to be a bigger whale

1935
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,760
and buy out the smaller whales and then

1936
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,078
the much smaller people just run them

1937
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,079
out of business and to the point that

1938
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,400
prices are so low for cannabis that

1939
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,280
there's not enough of a premium market

1940
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,559
left

1941
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:41,039
for the smaller artisan craft producers

1942
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,880
um that i herald on this show all the

1943
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,520
time you know the heritage growers who

1944
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,838
who have been doing this for for decades

1945
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,639
so there's going to be a certain point

1946
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:51,440
where

1947
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:55,598
um you know this this substantial

1948
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:58,159
number of growers are no longer able to

1949
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,480
see financial benefit in the license

1950
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:02,798
system and so they're like all right

1951
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,440
fine we're out and you know as we

1952
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:08,159
already know a lot of these um

1953
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,599
these these craft companies have got you

1954
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:11,279
know two businesses going right they've

1955
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,880
got the licensed one

1956
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,960
that they're hoping to participate in

1957
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,239
and they've got a second one that's

1958
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,480
that's still exporting and and helping

1959
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,318
pay the bills while the legal business

1960
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,798
gets up and running but but if there's

1961
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,400
enough strength in corporate cannabis

1962
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,319
they're never going to grow to that

1963
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,399
point and eventually they'll just have

1964
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,039
to you know choose to give up their

1965
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:35,838
license and air quotes go do something

1966
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:37,759
else right but for the craft growers

1967
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:39,920
that i know who have been grown who have

1968
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,238
grown up in cannabis

1969
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,640
cannabis growing is all they know

1970
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:46,639
and and i wonder what that looks like

1971
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,960
from a you know a sociological

1972
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:52,400
perspective which you offer about these

1973
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,960
people who grew up in illegal cannabis

1974
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,079
and and then took a shot in the licensed

1975
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,960
market

1976
01:08:56,079 --> 01:09:02,399
and became publicly known

1977
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:06,158
and the public market was so broken and

1978
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:08,318
monopolized by financialized

1979
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:11,039
cannabis companies that they have to go

1980
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:14,159
do something else and i suspect their

1981
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:17,119
first choice would be to go back to the

1982
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:21,198
the unlicensed market which has now

1983
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:23,039
grossly changed um both in california

1984
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,358
and in the

1985
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:28,238
markets that they used to and still do

1986
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:30,640
to a certain degree export too

1987
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,559
so so what do you think you know from

1988
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,880
from your perspective

1989
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,520
seeing the grand landscape what's gonna

1990
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:40,239
happen to this particular pool of

1991
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,319
heritage growers who eventually give up

1992
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:44,559
and say i can't do this in the licensed

1993
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,798
market what do you think or what have

1994
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:50,560
you seen these folks starting to do

1995
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:50,560
when the black market is so changed

1996
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,159
well let's say you know

1997
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:58,319
let's acknowledge from the gecko that

1998
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:00,719
probably 95

1999
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,960
of them never made a go of the licensed

2000
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,359
market right really i didn't i didn't

2001
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,560
realize it was such a large share

2002
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:09,359
of the

2003
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,960
unlicensed market that never even tried

2004
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:12,319
that's that's an impressive that's an

2005
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,920
impressive number

2006
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:15,519
yeah yeah i mean

2007
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,880
i'm pulling that number a little out of

2008
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,400
my butt but it's also a matter of uh

2009
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,359
you know

2010
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:22,960
uh

2011
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:25,519
you know you look at humboldt but had

2012
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,840
that had you know an estimated to say 15

2013
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,800
000 you know cultivators

2014
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:34,319
you know on the on the on the eve of

2015
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,440
legalization and they have uh 800 you

2016
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:36,559
know

2017
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:40,479
uh

2018
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,920
uh in 800 distinct you know owners

2019
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:43,119
of cultivation or other kinds of

2020
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,480
licenses

2021
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:47,039
right now

2022
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:49,119
uh that are going through the permitting

2023
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:51,039
and licensing process

2024
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:53,198
um so

2025
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:54,800
that right there is 90 right like

2026
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,799
roughly

2027
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,560
and and humble you know

2028
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,640
had a very high concentration also has a

2029
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,360
very very large amount of licenses per

2030
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,719
capita way more than anybody else

2031
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,679
so

2032
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,119
uh you know mendocino certainly uh

2033
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,399
similarly

2034
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:12,960
you're already actually seeing in

2035
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:15,599
mendocino and elsewhere the revenue

2036
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,359
reports of the last year of you know all

2037
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,120
these people that had permits and were

2038
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:20,799
operating but are not reporting revenue

2039
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:22,238
this year and don't appear to be

2040
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,920
operating so we're already going through

2041
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:25,359
an extinction event

2042
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,239
in that sense

2043
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:30,079
and and so there's kind of two things to

2044
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:32,959
think about here

2045
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:32,960
one is you know

2046
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:35,519
returning to

2047
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:37,760
uh

2048
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,199
the unregulated markets

2049
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:43,119
or participating in it as a way to try

2050
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:46,559
to stay in place and not become

2051
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:46,559
displaced from their communities right

2052
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:52,000
finding something else to do in terms of

2053
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:55,000
an occupation

2054
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
um

2055
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,960
there's also

2056
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,159
uh displacement you know like uh

2057
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,560
definitely a lot of people went to

2058
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:03,519
oklahoma lately right

2059
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,280
uh

2060
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,120
so

2061
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,920
these are all you know different

2062
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,840
outcomes you know staying in place

2063
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,119
and if your name is already in the

2064
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,679
system your property is already in the

2065
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:17,279
system and you cease to be a licensed

2066
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,960
or permitted operator stop reporting

2067
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,279
revenues here

2068
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,158
you stuck your neck out and so the odds

2069
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:23,359
that you're going to be able to stay

2070
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:24,639
there and do the same thing are pretty

2071
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:25,599
low yeah

2072
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,800
because

2073
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,000
you know they're looking for you and

2074
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,039
they're they're wondering what happened

2075
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,039
to you

2076
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:33,279
uh so

2077
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:37,719
there's that aspect

2078
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:37,719
uh i think that it's important

2079
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:42,399
important to realize that

2080
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,759
a lot a lot of operators you know

2081
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,279
there's many different kinds of heritage

2082
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:53,519
farmers is the thing i'm struggling with

2083
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:55,759
here shango ah

2084
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,480
and

2085
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,239
some of them

2086
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:00,559
[Music]

2087
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:04,479
have been you know at the cutting edge

2088
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:06,719
of indoor and you know breeding and

2089
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,799
staying on top of the latest

2090
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:10,560
cultivars and and

2091
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,760
and regenerative agriculture and stuff

2092
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,280
like that and

2093
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,360
and then there's you know

2094
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:16,960
a lot of folks that uh

2095
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:19,439
you know were not they were you know

2096
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,960
they were growing and and they had

2097
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:26,799
places to to send it um

2098
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:28,800
so adapting i think to to new things

2099
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,480
especially you know

2100
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,320
staying on top of what it is you can

2101
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:33,519
export because it's not just anything

2102
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:36,799
anymore

2103
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:38,239
uh you know i i think that adapting in

2104
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,760
terms of uh

2105
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,319
what it is you're growing and how you're

2106
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:45,119
growing it are two big things

2107
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:48,319
uh and certainly reducing your inputs

2108
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:50,319
and staying you know low impact and i

2109
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:52,479
mean that you know

2110
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:55,198
environmentally as well as

2111
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:56,479
socially right uh staying under the

2112
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,238
radar

2113
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,718
uh you know these are all adaptive

2114
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:02,319
strategies that people are using

2115
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,760
uh

2116
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:05,519
i want to say that also within the

2117
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,760
licensed market

2118
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,800
the problem isn't just the msos over

2119
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,560
producing

2120
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,239
the problem is that california cannot

2121
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,640
open enough retail

2122
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,879
that like you know again

2123
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,199
two-thirds of its jurisdictions you know

2124
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,119
don't have retail

2125
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,439
and so what that means is that there's

2126
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:24,479
more and more product going to

2127
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:25,919
you know

2128
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:27,119
amount of stores that is staying

2129
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,719
completely

2130
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,920
you know the same

2131
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:34,319
and that drives down the cost of

2132
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:37,679
uh or the price of

2133
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:39,359
wholesale cannabis uh and eventually a

2134
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,800
little bit drives down the price of the

2135
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:43,599
consumer

2136
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,039
but then what's also happening

2137
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,000
is you know

2138
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:49,920
distributors uh

2139
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,119
this distribution licenses are operated

2140
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,560
as burners

2141
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,840
so then you have these entrepreneurs who

2142
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,960
basically

2143
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,400
acquire

2144
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,158
distribution licenses

2145
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,000
buy up tons of product

2146
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:01,439
and then report it all lost or stolen

2147
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,960
basically right

2148
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:05,359
uh and so it's like

2149
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,119
yeah your price on the uh

2150
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:09,279
your wholesale price that you can buy on

2151
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:11,039
the legal side is like down to

2152
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:12,559
very very little here four or five

2153
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,479
hundred three hundred

2154
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,400
uh and then you can turn around and

2155
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:17,919
export that somewhere else for

2156
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:20,079
three times as much

2157
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,158
you know per per pound

2158
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:23,519
you know that's when i think we talked

2159
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:25,198
about this before that's when basically

2160
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,560
the legal market

2161
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,479
becomes

2162
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,440
the diversion market yeah the diversion

2163
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:31,759
market

2164
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,519
uh and so

2165
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,039
uh

2166
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,520
that kind of interplay between the

2167
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:39,279
unregulated regulated you know diversion

2168
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:42,880
and not diversion

2169
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:44,800
dynamic is homeostatic in a certain way

2170
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,840
because now the unregulated market gets

2171
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,000
flooded

2172
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,360
and drives the price down

2173
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,359
uh

2174
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:53,279
so anybody going to the unregulated

2175
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:55,359
market and hoping that's what saves them

2176
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,238
is going to get chased by this flood of

2177
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:58,238
you know

2178
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:59,839
uh diversion coming from the licensed

2179
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:01,759
market in the license market so there's

2180
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,039
a dynamic that's not just like what's

2181
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,560
happening this year it's like what's

2182
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:06,800
happening next year

2183
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,360
uh and so

2184
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:12,079
uh this is all very difficult right uh

2185
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:15,599
but i what i will say though

2186
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:17,600
is that obviously you know

2187
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,760
there's there's no logical reason why

2188
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,760
farmers shouldn't have direct con to

2189
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,000
market access like why did they have to

2190
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,440
go through distributors and retailers

2191
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,119
why can't they sell directly to

2192
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:28,639
consumers right

2193
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,079
um

2194
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,640
and so

2195
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:35,359
you know if they if they got that

2196
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:38,159
that right as any other farmer or

2197
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:39,920
agriculture you know uh

2198
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:41,599
agricultural sector has you know you

2199
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,000
could sell your apples

2200
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,440
you know on a farm stand that's not

2201
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,960
nobody

2202
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,479
you don't get arrested for that you know

2203
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,439
like uh

2204
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,678
then

2205
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:54,479
that would help right

2206
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:57,840
i think that uh

2207
01:16:54,479 --> 01:17:01,678
the other part is like if you are

2208
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:04,400
producing the absolute top of the line

2209
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:06,480
craft stuff right

2210
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:07,519
then your market share isn't falling

2211
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:09,359
because

2212
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,000
basically those you know corporate

2213
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:13,519
cannabis at large scale

2214
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,279
can't produce

2215
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,360
quality that is high enough to attract

2216
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:18,960
the sophisticated consumer

2217
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:21,359
right like the sophisticated consumer is

2218
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,679
barely even patronizing the legal market

2219
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:24,559
right anyway right uh

2220
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,640
but

2221
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:32,320
the fact is you know like

2222
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:32,320
i remember in 1993 94 you know

2223
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:36,799
my stoner buddies uh

2224
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,839
you know coming to a party and they're

2225
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,920
like

2226
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,119
we got the kind bud you know like and i

2227
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,679
was like how much did you pay for that

2228
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:45,679
and they're like 400 an ounce

2229
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:47,039
and i was like oh my god because like

2230
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:50,560
what we were buying was like you know

2231
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:53,279
100 ounces of mexican seeded stuff and

2232
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,039
you know i didn't have any i didn't know

2233
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:57,198
you know

2234
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:58,800
why a poor college student would choose

2235
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:00,639
to like you know

2236
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,159
purchase a much more expensive product

2237
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,760
you know until you consume it and you

2238
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:06,079
see the difference

2239
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,600
uh and and you're ruined forever from

2240
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:10,238
mexican brickweed

2241
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,600
exactly exactly and and the fact is is

2242
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:13,198
that like

2243
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,840
you know over the course of the course

2244
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:17,678
of the 1990s and 2000s like

2245
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,880
people literally chose to spend four

2246
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:22,560
times more

2247
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,679
you know uh on the on the consumer end

2248
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,679
because they have they could have bought

2249
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,679
the mexican but our entire you know

2250
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:28,480
domestic market shifted

2251
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,719
uh

2252
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:32,718
towards the more expensive stuff

2253
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:36,000
because it was that much better

2254
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:39,439
and so like again there there is

2255
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,640
like craft actual craft you know

2256
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:42,079
uh

2257
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,400
production

2258
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:47,119
which not every heritage grower has the

2259
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:49,679
ability necessarily to do

2260
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:52,158
uh you know it will have shelf space

2261
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:55,279
uh at prices that are you know much more

2262
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:58,799
agreeable to the growers so you have to

2263
01:18:55,279 --> 01:19:01,920
actually hone your craft um

2264
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,600
uh in addition to you know embracing

2265
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,359
you know new marketing possibilities

2266
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,840
like appalachians and

2267
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:10,000
you know equity branded uh

2268
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,159
supply chains and local branded supply

2269
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,600
chains there are many other marketing

2270
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:16,000
tricks that you can do

2271
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,600
to kind of stay in the market but

2272
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,679
the fact is if you can't pay your rent

2273
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,199
you're not going to be

2274
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:23,279
you're not going to go forward with this

2275
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:24,879
and so

2276
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:27,599
those are those are kind of the options

2277
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:30,000
available is to you know embrace all the

2278
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,520
things that you can do to add value to

2279
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,600
your product

2280
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,840
and and and you know

2281
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,600
usually that

2282
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,360
means smaller scale cultivation because

2283
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,000
that's how you get really high quality

2284
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:44,079
products not mass-produced

2285
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,479
um

2286
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:48,559
and as long as you can do that you know

2287
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:50,639
if you're a heritage farmer

2288
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,520
you know that's rural on your land you

2289
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,119
know like

2290
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,120
that was the point you're you're doing

2291
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:56,960
this to stay on your land

2292
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,679
uh and you can

2293
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,920
grow you know organic

2294
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,199
food and vegetables as well and and mix

2295
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,880
it up right

2296
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:09,198
uh heritage farmers that are you know

2297
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:12,079
historically maybe more urban or

2298
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:14,079
indoor focused

2299
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:15,679
well

2300
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:17,359
is it gonna is it paying the rent or is

2301
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,960
it not you know like that's the question

2302
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:20,960
you know and if it's not and if you

2303
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,439
don't have access to market

2304
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,520
then uh

2305
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:27,198
you're gonna be displaced basically or

2306
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,159
or or you're gonna

2307
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:29,839
you know

2308
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:30,960
you're gonna get a different job

2309
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,560
and

2310
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,880
let's say that you know a lot of those

2311
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,120
those folks

2312
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,719
a lot of those folks actually developed

2313
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,719
trade skills

2314
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,800
that are pretty vital to like indoor

2315
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,279
production that are

2316
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,199
not bad options you know uh going back

2317
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:48,158
and going back into real estate going

2318
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:51,759
into

2319
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:54,719
you know hvac or or you know electric or

2320
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,880
whatever else you know

2321
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,840
those are options basically so

2322
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,760
uh

2323
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,679
like a lot of the rest of the

2324
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,440
gig economy it's kind of cobbling stuff

2325
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,520
together to

2326
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,960
to move forward so

2327
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,639
i think there's always been a difference

2328
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,000
though between the folks who were doing

2329
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:12,079
it to like

2330
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,600
stay out of the rat race

2331
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:16,880
and the people who were doing it to

2332
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:19,440
basically cheat in the rat race

2333
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,840
right yeah i followed this uh

2334
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:23,599
you follow that yeah yeah and i i got no

2335
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,679
moral you know judgment actually about

2336
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,719
the latter let's just say as well

2337
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,639
uh

2338
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:31,359
not necessarily it's like screw the rat

2339
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,279
race you know

2340
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:34,880
anybody who's trying to get around it is

2341
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:37,439
i totally understand it

2342
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,279
uh but you know like

2343
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:41,279
uh i think that's

2344
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:43,679
the right to not be displaced from one's

2345
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:45,359
community and land is a really important

2346
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:47,359
principle and and that's the one that i

2347
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:49,839
think we should be

2348
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:51,519
we we may be able to do something about

2349
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,039
um

2350
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,040
certainly the state of california is

2351
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:57,679
increasingly

2352
01:21:55,039 --> 01:22:00,000
uh maybe it's too little too late

2353
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:01,359
but you know the equity program monies

2354
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,439
are arriving

2355
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:05,359
there's another million dollars that

2356
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:07,519
uh humboldt county has taken out of

2357
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:10,960
their general fund to help their farmers

2358
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,960
this was just announced like a week ago

2359
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:16,639
uh you know jurisdictions who are

2360
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,158
collecting you know a bunch of taxes

2361
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,920
that aren't supporting their local

2362
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:22,158
businesses are going to lose those taxes

2363
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,239
so they're going to start you know

2364
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:25,759
saying okay well maybe you know maybe

2365
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:27,519
we'll you know beef up our equity

2366
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:29,440
programs try to keep people

2367
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,120
uh but but the ones that do that are

2368
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:33,279
usually the ones that recognize people

2369
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:35,439
that are part of their communities their

2370
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:36,479
mothers fathers sisters brothers and

2371
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:37,359
daughters and

2372
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:38,879
you know

2373
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:41,920
they're not trying to make a move to

2374
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:44,319
oklahoma you know yeah

2375
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:47,279
so so for the rest of this set let's uh

2376
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:49,920
let's take a let's pivot and move from

2377
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:52,800
more the governance um

2378
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,158
and cultural disciplines into

2379
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,679
public health

2380
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:57,679
and um you know

2381
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:02,800
nearly everyone knows somebody who's

2382
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:05,920
being helped by medical cannabis at this

2383
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,639
point even in states that don't have any

2384
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:11,760
sort of medical or you know wreck

2385
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:14,000
cannabis they still have their sister

2386
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,400
who lives in california or their uncle

2387
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,238
who lives in oklahoma and and these

2388
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:20,158
people are saying oh my gosh i'm using

2389
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:23,759
this and my arthritis is so much better

2390
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:25,359
so so people are aware of medical

2391
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,719
cannabis use now

2392
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:31,920
and it is very quickly tearing down the

2393
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:33,679
the taboos and and moral panic that as

2394
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,679
you refer to it in the book

2395
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:36,560
and um

2396
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,880
and

2397
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:41,199
it has now shown this interesting

2398
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:43,119
contrast between public health and

2399
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:46,319
public policy

2400
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:48,399
because public policy on especially the

2401
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,960
local level because of the patchwork

2402
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:53,439
regulations we've talked about

2403
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:56,399
local level public policy can be

2404
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:57,198
anti-cannabis and be decreasing access

2405
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:58,719
or

2406
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,039
or for example

2407
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:03,119
not having pesticide

2408
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:04,639
tests because the businesses are

2409
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:07,920
resisting it

2410
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:09,039
versus the public health drive for

2411
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,440
cannabis

2412
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:13,279
because people are finding unique ways

2413
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:14,879
to get relief from cannabis that doesn't

2414
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:16,880
have some of the same side effects as

2415
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,679
some of their other options

2416
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,880
so

2417
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:23,760
um what are you seeing um you know from

2418
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:25,679
from your 10 000 foot view of of this

2419
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,280
this contrast this friction that we're

2420
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:31,279
getting now

2421
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:35,119
between public health and and um kind of

2422
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:35,119
antiquated uh policy

2423
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,920
well i think that uh

2424
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:41,198
as usual i'm gonna point towards

2425
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,719
complexity

2426
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:44,319
yeah

2427
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,239
because i think that often you know

2428
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:47,519
public health institutions are actually

2429
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:50,079
you know

2430
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,360
uh feeding back on you know prohibition

2431
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:54,000
stigma

2432
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:56,479
uh and you know doing everything they

2433
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,520
can to actually you know

2434
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:58,959
uh

2435
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,280
keep prohibition and legalization

2436
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,198
entangled right uh

2437
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:08,000
and so

2438
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:11,279
uh you know an example of that would be

2439
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,279
the ways in which you know

2440
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,840
really strict zoning

2441
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,800
in terms of like setbacks in particular

2442
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:21,679
from parks and schools and so forth that

2443
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,840
are way more harsh than alcohol

2444
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,039
uh you know are supported by you know

2445
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,480
usually public health you know

2446
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:30,238
professionals

2447
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:33,439
uh who are all very very very worried

2448
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:34,959
about the kids yeah uh of course it's

2449
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:36,399
it's usually the white kids ultimately

2450
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:39,279
that they're worried about

2451
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:39,279
um so

2452
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:42,719
so let's just say that they're not

2453
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,079
necessarily you know opposing each other

2454
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,480
necessarily

2455
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:49,039
there are you know

2456
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:52,479
in terms of health research

2457
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:54,158
more broadly speaking um i think

2458
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:57,198
that

2459
01:25:54,158 --> 01:26:00,879
it is pretty important for

2460
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:03,439
you know uh bioscientific research

2461
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,639
to do its thing

2462
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:06,839
and

2463
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:10,800
uh this is where i want to give a plug

2464
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:13,760
to the person you last had on miyabi

2465
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,960
uh dr miyabi shields dr miyabi shields

2466
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,079
man like

2467
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,520
that's

2468
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:19,119
pretty much like both of those

2469
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,560
interviews

2470
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:22,559
i would just say

2471
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,719
you know are an answer to that your

2472
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:28,000
question you know like uh

2473
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:30,560
you know this is someone who

2474
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,960
is talking about the science of it as

2475
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,679
something that can be complementary to

2476
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,359
the herbal medicine and traditional

2477
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:39,039
medicine approaches

2478
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:40,719
and not just

2479
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:43,039
uh you know uh

2480
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:45,279
another hierarchical situation where the

2481
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:46,800
the pursuit for molecular

2482
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:48,639
you know uh

2483
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,760
double blind controlled

2484
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:51,119
studies

2485
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,400
you know

2486
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:54,880
uh

2487
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:55,759
runs herbal medicine out of town right

2488
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,079
the

2489
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,320
burns the witches at the stake

2490
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:02,000
which is i think a situation that is a

2491
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:04,319
problem for public health

2492
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,479
uh but can be complementary and

2493
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:08,880
synergistic with it um

2494
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,959
i also think that uh

2495
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,319
she had some really sophisticated

2496
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,039
answers

2497
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:16,079
when talking about the

2498
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:18,719
you know

2499
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:21,519
the the cultural value of trusting you

2500
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:23,760
know the experts in terms of you know uh

2501
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:26,400
bioscience and and this humility with

2502
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,400
respect to like what we actually know

2503
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:30,319
uh which is

2504
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:31,279
you know not much yet you know i think

2505
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:34,158
she

2506
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:36,399
they sorry my apologies for the

2507
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:38,638
um misgendering um

2508
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:41,759
they pointed towards you know really

2509
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:43,279
being at the very beginning of discovery

2510
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,280
about you know the endocannabinoid

2511
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:47,920
system and so forth which

2512
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:49,759
is often not the attitude of researchers

2513
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,119
getting big grants because they can't

2514
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,320
say that in their grant applications

2515
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:53,279
otherwise they're not going to get that

2516
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:54,158
grant

2517
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:56,800
so

2518
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:58,238
there's there's this

2519
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,960
culture i think

2520
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:02,879
that is attached entirely to funding

2521
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,520
that uh you know promotes this

2522
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:08,079
hierarchical dismissive

2523
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,920
uh approach to health that is you know

2524
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:11,039
only worried about

2525
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,960
danger

2526
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:16,000
and is not humble about what it actually

2527
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:18,480
knows as opposed to a you know health

2528
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,319
research agenda driven by

2529
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:22,479
uh

2530
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:24,238
bioscientists like miyabi

2531
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:27,279
who are

2532
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:29,119
listening to you know what what patients

2533
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:31,679
are saying about their own bodies and

2534
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:35,039
respecting that right um that's what i

2535
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:37,760
mean by a more non-hierarchical approach

2536
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:39,439
that uh expertise is developed you know

2537
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:43,400
with patients

2538
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:43,399
not in spite of them

2539
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:52,400
so um i would say that in addition to

2540
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:53,439
um this non-hierarchical approach

2541
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:56,879
um

2542
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:59,919
this this contrast that that i recognize

2543
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:02,560
that you're saying is very complex um

2544
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:06,480
it's it's also complex in other ways

2545
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:09,360
right for example the the limitations on

2546
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,959
on on scientific research still that

2547
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:13,599
even though we know

2548
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,319
there's a great need for more research

2549
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,400
into the medicine well it's still really

2550
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:21,359
hard to get them approved using these

2551
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:24,158
controlled substances or or another as

2552
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:26,479
we've seen um play out recently in the

2553
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:28,638
olympics you know the regulation in

2554
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:31,439
sports making criminals out of athletes

2555
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:33,119
who are just trying to recover there

2556
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:36,960
seems to be

2557
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:39,920
a culture-wide friction between the

2558
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,719
public health benefits of cannabis

2559
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,359
and

2560
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:46,639
the the kind of hangover

2561
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:48,559
of moral panic that drove prohibition

2562
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,000
for the last you know

2563
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:54,080
50 years

2564
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:57,359
he absolutely absolutely so

2565
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:58,719
the you know health research has has

2566
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:01,359
been a part of the moral panic

2567
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:02,960
historically it's been maybe uh the main

2568
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:04,319
driver of it

2569
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,639
uh

2570
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:08,880
because nida you know again was funding

2571
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:10,639
research for you know 40 years on how

2572
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,279
harmful cannabis could be

2573
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:15,520
um and so

2574
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:18,559
i think that that's that's important i

2575
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:20,320
think that that you know

2576
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,560
the the olympics example is a really

2577
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:24,559
interesting one as is the the general

2578
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,719
field of exercise and sport that dr

2579
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,400
whitney ogle talks about in her chapter

2580
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,079
in public health

2581
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:31,519
that

2582
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:34,158
you know when when whitney went back to

2583
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:36,880
do essentially a literature review what

2584
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:39,759
she found was in the 1960s and 1970s

2585
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:43,359
there were actually all these

2586
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:45,119
the beginnings of a body of of research

2587
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:48,719
that was about the potential public

2588
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:50,479
health or health benefits of of cannabis

2589
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:52,800
in exercise and sport

2590
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:54,879
and it completely vanished

2591
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,239
so much so that like when you're

2592
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,560
starting a paper now and you're

2593
01:30:56,238 --> 01:31:00,638
reviewing the literature like

2594
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,320
there's not much from the last 10 years

2595
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:06,319
but there's a whole lot from the 60s and

2596
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:08,000
70s and so it's like a thread to pick up

2597
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:10,719
to pick up really that got just

2598
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,158
completely obliterated and dropped

2599
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:14,560
um

2600
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:17,198
and in exercise and sport obviously when

2601
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,679
it comes to the olympics

2602
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:21,759
i think that

2603
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:24,639
what the the scandal about you know

2604
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:27,280
shikari richardson being disqualified

2605
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:29,840
from the olympics

2606
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:31,840
had more to do with like a public like

2607
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:34,079
what you know like

2608
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:36,079
like uh people being flabbergasted

2609
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:37,519
people being flabbergasted then any sort

2610
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:40,079
of like oh this is like a new thing

2611
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:43,560
because being a ross roboglio the

2612
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:43,559
olympic uh

2613
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:49,760
uh you know 15 years ago was uh lost his

2614
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,360
medal right but but nobody said okay

2615
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,000
let's change the rules therefore like

2616
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:55,198
now like this literally is okay wait a

2617
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,279
sec like

2618
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:59,678
this is a really weird thing

2619
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:01,599
that we have disqualified a world-class

2620
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:03,279
athlete for using cannabis

2621
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,920
because we have listed it as a

2622
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:08,960
performance enhancing drug

2623
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:10,000
because that's how you ban things from

2624
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,600
our

2625
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,840
you know from athletes

2626
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,520
uh it's like it's like backing into the

2627
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,279
regulations it's just completely

2628
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,040
completely and i do think that that

2629
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:20,800
things will change although

2630
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:23,760
here's the question for you shango like

2631
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,279
is cannabis a performance-enhancing drug

2632
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,560
can it be

2633
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:28,238
uh

2634
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,679
i i think that's like a next level

2635
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:32,479
question that

2636
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:34,560
you know i i would argue

2637
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:36,079
not to the level where it you know

2638
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,679
should be banned like steroids or

2639
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:38,840
something like that right

2640
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:40,560
but it is

2641
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:42,159
anti-inflammatory it might help you

2642
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,800
recover faster

2643
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:46,479
uh you know world-class athletes that

2644
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,960
use cannabis

2645
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:50,959
including like mba players you know like

2646
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,119
like at least half of them apparently

2647
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,399
uh

2648
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:56,479
you know

2649
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:59,039
is that giving him an edge

2650
01:32:56,479 --> 01:33:00,079
uh and that's a research question

2651
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:02,319
right

2652
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:04,000
uh but you don't start from the point of

2653
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:06,238
it's already banned and then then ask

2654
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,840
that recent question you you say this

2655
01:33:06,238 --> 01:33:09,519
doesn't make sense on the surface and it

2656
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,760
wasn't in here for any particular

2657
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,440
research reason there's no research that

2658
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,119
said this is performance-enhancing drug

2659
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:17,359
therefore let's ban it

2660
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:18,960
uh the the reason the research was like

2661
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:19,920
is it illegal therefore let's ban it

2662
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,480
right

2663
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,399
uh but like

2664
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:25,678
that's you know i think a very

2665
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:27,679
interesting

2666
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:29,440
research agenda which is is whitney's as

2667
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:31,440
well it's like well how can cannabis be

2668
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:33,759
integrated into you know

2669
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,559
uh exercise and sport in a healthy way

2670
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,320
and

2671
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,320
i think that's a legitimate question but

2672
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:41,759
it's you know

2673
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:43,679
i think there there there's uh you know

2674
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,920
there's a research agenda there about

2675
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:48,880
whether cannabis can be performance

2676
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,719
enhancing that shouldn't be connected to

2677
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,239
an already existing rule that like you

2678
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:53,119
know bans people

2679
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:54,399
but

2680
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:55,840
if we're going to argue that yeah

2681
01:33:54,399 --> 01:33:57,359
cannabis can be used you know when

2682
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,880
you're exercising

2683
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:01,359
then you have to embrace that as a

2684
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,880
legitimate research question right on

2685
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:04,559
well let's go ahead and take our second

2686
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,480
short break and be right back you are

2687
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,960
listening to shaping fire and my guest

2688
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:09,899
today is cannabis researcher dr dominic

2689
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,158
corva

2690
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:13,920
[Music]

2691
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:15,839
there is no doubt that autoflowering

2692
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:17,920
cannabis plants have finally come in to

2693
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,920
their own and night owl seeds works

2694

as a business owner you are incredibly

2765
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,840
busy in reality you are responsible for

2766
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:05,760
everything your company does you've got

2767
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,440
so many responsibilities every single

2768
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,520
day that often you just don't have the

2769
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:11,279
time to really dig into your marketing

2770
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,480
as deeply as you'd like

2771

you know there's more that you could do

2772
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:15,759
to reach out to new customers and

2773
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:17,198
encourage loyalty and the customers you

2774
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,800
already have but you certainly don't

2775
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:20,399
have the time for it and you're not

2776
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,840
ready to hire somebody full time for

2777
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:24,638

sales materials

2809
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,079
no doubt this is a paid commercial spot

2810
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,400
but that does not mean they bought my

2811
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:32,158
opinion i've worked with blunt branding

2812
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:34,079
on five projects now for various of

2813
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:35,679
their clients and every single time they

2814
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:38,000
have done more than they have promised

2815
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:40,239
and over delivered on results i love how

2816
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,079
they generate new revenue and focus on

2817
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:43,599
that as the goal instead of just making

2818
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:45,439
a pretty logo

2819
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,119
similarly every single friend i've

2820
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:48,879
referred them to has come back to thank

2821
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:49,679

01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:29,118
researcher doctor dominic corva

2841
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,118
so dominic i've got another point i want

2842
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:32,000
to bring up about public uh public

2843
01:39:31,118 --> 01:39:34,719
health

2844
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,719
and um throughout the book prisons come

2845
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:40,239
up again and again as an enforcement

2846
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:43,039
tool that is applied unevenly both by uh

2847
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:45,118
well i guess it's more by by locale by

2848
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:46,960
race and who the judge may be sometimes

2849
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:48,799
it's just the role of the dice

2850
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,079
the the number of americans who remain

2851
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,480
in prison

2852
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:54,639
you know props up a

2853
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:56,799
for you know for-profit prison system

2854
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:59,279
that is of course severely broken

2855
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,279
and now we see the strange inequity of

2856
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:02,880
prisoners continuing to be held while

2857
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:05,439
white-collar entrepreneurs receive

2858
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,600
licenses to sell the same stuff

2859
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:09,118
not only does that strike most folks as

2860
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:11,360
wildly unfair

2861
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:13,519
prison for non-violent cannabis offenses

2862
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:16,960
continues to break up families and have

2863
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:18,639
extensive impacts on public health

2864
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:21,359
so would you

2865
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:24,159
continue with an explanation of what you

2866
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:27,118
see happening now along the prison

2867
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:30,719
public health axis during this you know

2868
01:40:27,118 --> 01:40:34,319
difficult and rocky transition between

2869
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:37,840
prohibition and prohibition alongside

2870
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:37,840
licensed and taxed cannabis

2871
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:42,238
yeah absolutely there's a lot to say

2872
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:44,880
about that and and the first thing that

2873
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:47,279
i want to point out is that

2874
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:50,079
for example in colorado legalization

2875
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:51,439
came with new criminal penalties

2876
01:40:50,079 --> 01:40:53,840
for people

2877
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:55,919
under the age of 21

2878
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:59,440
and that this is

2879
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,880
often a knee-jerk part of legalization

2880
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:03,039
is to

2881
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:06,079
actually increase penalties criminal

2882
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:08,079
penalties uh for uh

2883
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:09,118
you know folks under the age of 21 which

2884
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:10,800
is

2885
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:14,000
you know

2886
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:16,480
absolutely counterproductive um

2887
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,520
and so you know that has to do with kind

2888
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:21,519
of like deciding an age at which

2889
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,880
cannabis is legal which is also part of

2890
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,000
the entanglement of legalization and

2891
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:26,400
prohibition

2892
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,479
because like as far as i know

2893
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:29,839
we will never be done with prohibition

2894
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:31,279
you know uh

2895
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,600
criminal prohibition sanctions against

2896
01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:35,198
people under the age of 21.

2897
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,199
so um

2898
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:38,638
perhaps these may get reduced like civil

2899
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:40,319
ones but uh

2900
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:42,400
as long as we have basically decided

2901
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:44,479
that a legal consumer is only someone

2902
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:45,519
over the age of 21 or someone with a

2903
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:48,158
medical

2904
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:50,239
uh you know uh authorization that's

2905
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:52,638
under 121

2906
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:54,799
then we're going to have

2907
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,960
uh you know a criminal justice system

2908
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,239
that tilts against the younger people in

2909
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,118
cannabis

2910
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:01,759
um

2911
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:03,279
also as we pointed out before

2912
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:05,520
demographically

2913
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:06,479
the legal licenses are going to you know

2914
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,920
whiter

2915
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:10,079
wealthier people

2916
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:12,079
and they sometimes have an incentive to

2917
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:13,760
call for more enforcement and that

2918
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:16,238
enforcement happens

2919
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,039
against black and brown people

2920
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:22,638
uh disproportionately

2921
01:42:19,039 --> 01:42:23,519
this is especially true in urban areas

2922
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:24,719
so

2923
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,520
the phenomenon we call mass

2924
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,719
incarceration

2925
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:32,480
is

2926
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:36,079
a combination of federal and and local

2927
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:38,158
you know prison systems basically right

2928
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:40,319
uh that sometimes have something to do

2929
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:41,279
with each other and sometimes not

2930
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:44,238
uh

2931
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:46,079
in large urban cities like los angeles

2932
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:49,519
new york chicago

2933
01:42:46,079 --> 01:42:54,000
in the 1990s and 2000s

2934
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:54,000
what those cities chose to do

2935
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:58,800
in terms of policing and public safety

2936
01:42:56,479 --> 01:43:00,959
was to do broken windows policing what

2937
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:03,760
they call broken windows policing

2938
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:08,000
which meant that basically the police

2939
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:09,280
had kind of a free hand to um

2940
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,479
uh

2941
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:12,479
identify

2942
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:14,559
you know the metaphoric broken windows

2943
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:16,959
uh signs of disorder

2944
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:18,960
in any given community

2945
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:22,840
and you know

2946
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:25,439
come up with ways to uh you know

2947
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:27,199
uh bring them into the criminal justice

2948
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:28,799
system and of course

2949
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:29,759
uh

2950
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,800
you know

2951
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:34,400
usually a broken window in a white

2952
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,159
community is a black person right

2953
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:37,039
there's a sign of disorder

2954
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:40,799
so

2955
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:42,719
uh in in urban areas in particular

2956
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,320
that kind of

2957
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:45,840
policy combined with that kind of

2958
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:47,840
discretion

2959
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,960
really intensified

2960
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:53,760
the you know uh bringing black and brown

2961
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,600
people you know uh into the criminal

2962
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:58,400
justice system

2963
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,639
um this is also true in rural areas but

2964
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:02,559
the the

2965
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:03,600
disproportionality is very very

2966
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,280
different

2967
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,800
that that black and brown people in

2968
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:08,479
rural areas definitely are

2969
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,000
disproportionately you know when you

2970
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:12,959
look at the numbers

2971
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,118
uh arrested uh for for for cannabis and

2972
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,760
other drug crimes

2973
01:44:15,118 --> 01:44:20,158
but there is it is it is drastically

2974
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:22,800
lower than in urban areas at the same

2975
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:25,359
time their like arrest rates are often

2976
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,639
higher than urban areas per capita

2977
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:28,079
which means that they are arresting a

2978
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:30,480
lot more white people

2979
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:31,760
as well and women actually in rural

2980
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:33,279
areas

2981
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,600
often have

2982
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:38,238
higher than state average um

2983
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:40,079
arrests of women

2984
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:42,399
and

2985
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:44,158
this is in particular let me say to

2986
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:46,238
because the data that i'm that i'm

2987
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:47,759
thinking about is from california so

2988
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:50,000
let's let's make sure that i'm not

2989
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:51,600
trying to generalize i think that that's

2990
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,319
a research agenda for everywhere else as

2991
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,480
well by the way but we know this uh uh

2992
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:58,799
uh of california and especially

2993
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:00,158
uh legacy producing regions which are

2994
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:04,000
the ones that i've been able to study

2995
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:05,519
the data for um

2996
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,439
so

2997
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,560
the other part of it is

2998
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:10,719
that

2999
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,239
a lot has been done in the last 10 to 20

3000
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:15,520
years

3001
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:18,238
to actually reduce

3002
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,239
um jail populations local local jail

3003
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:22,079
populations in big cities

3004
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:25,118
that there's been basically reforms

3005
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:27,840
going on since the early 2000s

3006
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:28,839
that are you know bail reform or other

3007
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:32,719
things

3008
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:34,800
um that are helping a lot with that but

3009
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:36,639
folks in federal prison

3010
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:39,600
it's it's a it's a population that's

3011
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:40,560
much more stable and much more long-term

3012
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,360
uh

3013
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,440
and

3014
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:44,880
part of this has to do

3015
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:47,198
with

3016
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,719
the power prosecutors especially federal

3017
01:45:47,198 --> 01:45:52,079
prosecutors

3018
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:52,079
uh that basically

3019
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:57,359
increase substantially relative to

3020
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:59,520
defense or judges actually since in

3021
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:02,960
given the the criminal justice acts of

3022
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:05,520
you know 1986 1988 1994

3023
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:07,279
that basically created these draconian

3024
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,880
mandatory minimums

3025
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:11,679
truth and sentencing

3026
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:14,319
and all this tough on crime legislation

3027
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:16,399
that basically means that whatever

3028
01:46:14,319 --> 01:46:17,759
whatever it is you did when you did it

3029
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:20,399
is actually pretty important because if

3030
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,719
you did it in 1988

3031
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:25,118
you're you got like you know 40 years to

3032
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:27,118
life or something for something that you

3033
01:46:25,118 --> 01:46:29,118
know uh today would not get you 40 years

3034
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:30,960
of life and this is true for every

3035
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:33,599
offense not just cannabis

3036
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,679
cannabis is part of of course at the

3037
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,840
federal level which means you know we're

3038
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:39,679
talking about the federal prison system

3039
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,960
uh part of

3040
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:42,399
prohibition

3041
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:44,079
that means not just that cannabis is

3042
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:45,118
prohibited but like

3043
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:46,238
all these other drugs are also

3044
01:46:45,118 --> 01:46:49,198
prohibited

3045
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:51,519
and so cannabis is part of

3046
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:53,439
you know this range of delinquencies

3047
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,119
essentially that the state has decided

3048
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:58,158
is worth like

3049
01:46:55,118 --> 01:46:59,920
you know all this effort time and money

3050
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:00,799
to imprison people for and lock them up

3051
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:01,920
for

3052
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,520
and so

3053
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,800
cannabis is kind of along for the ride

3054
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:07,840
with the other drugs whenever there's a

3055
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:10,079
moral panic about crack cannabis also

3056
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:11,679
gets caught up and it's about fentanyl

3057
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:13,279
cannabis is going to get caught up in it

3058
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:14,880
at least federally right

3059
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:16,960
it's you know

3060
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,880
to prosecutors it's it's it's a drug

3061
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:21,520
crime you know it's it's a felony it's

3062
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:23,840
not a cannabis felony it's not a you

3063
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,840
know

3064
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,479
some other kind of felony so it's

3065
01:47:26,158 --> 01:47:30,319
important and this is actually

3066
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:32,000
the other part that's that i think in

3067
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:32,880
the introduction will really lay out is

3068
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,719
like

3069
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,560
don't forget the cannabis probation

3070
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:37,920
prohibition is absolutely part of drug

3071
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,520
prohibition

3072
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,118
and that's an entanglement that is

3073
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:43,119
absolutely meta

3074
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:45,439
because

3075
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:46,960
drug prohibition you know takes cannabis

3076
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:48,238
along for the ride

3077
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,198
um

3078
01:47:48,238 --> 01:47:51,359
so

3079
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:53,839
with respect to you know

3080
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:55,839
who gets prison and not

3081
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:57,679
and in terms of you know wealthy white

3082
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:59,279
people having licenses to sell things

3083
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:01,279
people are going to prison for

3084
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:02,960
i would just point out that like

3085
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:04,559
even if those wealthy white people were

3086
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,319
getting arrested

3087
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,679
they would either not be spending any

3088
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:09,519
time in prison

3089
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:11,679
or they would be spending basically

3090
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,920
their time in prison club med like like

3091
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:17,118
martha stewart right yeah like that's

3092
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:19,440
our criminal justice system it is

3093
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:21,039
absolutely unequal in this country just

3094
01:48:19,439 --> 01:48:22,000
like our economy is

3095
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:23,439
uh

3096
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,719
the privileges you have when you have a

3097
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:26,719
lot of capital

3098
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:28,719
have nothing to do with whether that's

3099
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:31,039
cannabis capital or whether it's oil

3100
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:32,800
capital or whether it's pharma capital

3101
01:48:31,039 --> 01:48:35,840
it's privilege

3102
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:38,320
uh and so it's very important i think

3103
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,319
not to

3104
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:43,600
not to be like militantly particular

3105
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:45,279
about cannabis as an issue and and and

3106
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,679
and the prison system

3107
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:50,880
actually like our prison system itself

3108
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:53,118
is just awful prosecutorial discretion

3109
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:55,520
has driven mass incarceration

3110
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:57,759
uh no amount of you know legalizing

3111
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:00,080
discrete supply chains of cannabis

3112
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,600
are going to have a large impact on

3113
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:02,960
what's going on there

3114
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,800
and like

3115
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:07,198
you know sure it's very important to

3116
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:09,119
advocate for people to get out of prison

3117
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:10,799
but i i think that like a lot of people

3118
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:12,399
are really kind of myopically focused

3119
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,639
just on cannabis criminals and cannabis

3120
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:16,719
crimes and actually

3121
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:19,760
it's all the other ones too

3122
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:22,158
there are a lot of people who just

3123
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,199
are poorer and are you know people of

3124
01:49:22,158 --> 01:49:24,479
color

3125
01:49:23,198 --> 01:49:25,919
that are

3126
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:27,279
caught up and trapped in this prison

3127
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,639
system whether or not it's about

3128
01:49:27,279 --> 01:49:30,559
cannabis

3129
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:31,920
so uh this is one of those things that i

3130
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,719
think

3131
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:37,359
in terms of the promises and and and

3132
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:39,599
goals of legalization has shifted

3133
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:41,519
like back in 2010 there was a lot talk

3134
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:42,880
about you know ending mass incarceration

3135
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,679
because you're legalizing cannabis which

3136
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:47,920
is always a great exaggeration

3137
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,520
uh and i think in 2020

3138
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,880
what you have is actually more of a like

3139
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:53,040
let's put our money where our mouth is

3140
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:55,359
at this point um because back then it

3141
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:56,560
was just kind of a marketing play

3142
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:58,238
and in many ways it did a great

3143
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,080
disservice to black and brown people by

3144
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:01,759
legalizing cannabis and then absolutely

3145
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:04,238
having no

3146
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,840
no part of the legal cannabis system

3147
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:08,000
oriented towards you know actually

3148
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:08,800
helping black and brown people we use

3149
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,319
them

3150
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:13,760
we use them in in washington we

3151
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:16,079
absolutely use them

3152
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,440
as like let's legalize cannabis because

3153
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:18,960
it's bad for minorities but then

3154
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:20,960
legalization comes along it actually

3155
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,840
doesn't do anything good for for people

3156
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,639
of color

3157
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,319
uh

3158
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:26,719
and i think that's changed uh

3159
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:28,960
significantly in the last 10 years

3160
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:30,560
i think that the the aclu was probably

3161
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,279
the worst offender

3162
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,560
uh

3163
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:36,238
is much more in tune now to uh the the

3164
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:38,480
realities of the situation is no longer

3165
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:41,439
treating this like advertisement

3166
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:42,718
for for legalization right on

3167
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:44,319
well thank you for that perspective

3168
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:46,560
dominic you're you're always you're

3169
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:47,920
always remixing my perspective and i

3170
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:48,880
appreciate that

3171
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,560
um

3172
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,359
i've got two more questions left for our

3173
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:55,199
conversation and each of them

3174
01:50:53,359 --> 01:50:56,079
hits on different different areas in the

3175
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:58,000
book

3176
01:50:56,079 --> 01:51:00,158
i see that professor evan mills is back

3177
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,560
with an update of his groundbreaking

3178
01:51:00,158 --> 01:51:04,000
research into electrical usage by indoor

3179
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,560
cultivators

3180
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,079
his his original paper kind of blew

3181
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:11,440
everybody away back i don't know what

3182
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:14,319
was it 2013 or so 2012 yeah and it just

3183
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:16,319
floored everybody um the numbers he was

3184
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:18,559
quoting that would

3185
01:51:16,319 --> 01:51:21,279
the electricity that was being used by

3186
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:23,199
indoor cultivation and

3187
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:27,679
for a while there anyway

3188
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:30,719
it looked like it was going to influence

3189
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:33,359
regulations and encourage a

3190
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:35,679
preferred regulatory

3191
01:51:33,359 --> 01:51:38,799
environment for outdoor and you know

3192
01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:43,679
that mostly went away as um as indoor

3193
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:46,639
interests um lobbied back um but uh the

3194
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:49,118
the the press version of of of your new

3195
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:51,520
book that i got did not have the the the

3196
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:54,079
chapter from professor mills in it and

3197
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:55,599
and i think that uh i and probably a lot

3198
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:58,719
of other people who are familiar with

3199
01:51:55,599 --> 01:52:01,360
that work uh his early work are curious

3200
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:02,639
to know what he has to say now so so

3201
01:52:01,359 --> 01:52:04,158
since i haven't read the chapter i don't

3202
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:05,920
know how to direct you on this question

3203
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:09,198
but it's other than to say

3204
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:10,399
what what does evan mills say now

3205
01:52:09,198 --> 01:52:12,479
oh well

3206
01:52:10,399 --> 01:52:14,000
you know evan has a lot to say about how

3207
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:15,519
this is playing out in the regulated

3208
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,359
landscape

3209
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,320
so he's not just engaging with like you

3210
01:52:17,359 --> 01:52:21,279
know

3211
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:23,118
arcata california and the electricity

3212
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:24,880
usage in houses he's

3213
01:52:23,118 --> 01:52:26,158
he's talking about a much bigger carbon

3214
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:27,599
footprint when you're talking about

3215
01:52:26,158 --> 01:52:28,799
warehouses

3216
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:32,159
um

3217
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,840
and so uh what he really especially

3218
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:35,679
engages really very well with is how

3219
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:38,000
regulations

3220
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:39,359
that are supposed to be about you know

3221
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,279
uh

3222
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:42,559
protecting the environment

3223
01:52:41,279 --> 01:52:44,079
you know because we're

3224
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,280
real worried about as we should be you

3225
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:46,880
know water

3226
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:48,800
uh land use

3227
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,000
you know um

3228
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,000
uh

3229
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,760
impacts the wildlife absolutely like

3230
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,479
those are important things

3231
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,679
so we've we've got all these regulations

3232
01:52:56,479 --> 01:52:58,718
actually

3233
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:59,760
like

3234
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:02,000
the ones that are probably most

3235
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:04,800
difficult for you know uh heritage

3236
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,880
farmers are these sql regulations

3237
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:10,480
but at the same time we're basically

3238
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:12,319
incentivizing carbon footprint intensive

3239
01:53:10,479 --> 01:53:13,919
cultivation

3240
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:15,920
because we're making it so difficult to

3241
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:19,599
grow it outdoors and on ag land

3242
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:19,599
necessarily along with other crops

3243
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,520
so

3244
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:25,279
the perspective really is a is a bigger

3245
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:26,719
and broader structural perspective

3246
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:28,719
really um

3247
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:31,198
he reviews information from like

3248
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:32,480
california and colorado in particular

3249
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:34,399
um

3250
01:53:32,479 --> 01:53:36,319
and

3251
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:38,839
what's interesting is obviously

3252
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:41,840
his paper had a big impact back

3253
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:43,520
then and arcade you know raised its

3254
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:45,520
electricity tax rates and everybody

3255
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:49,119
moved to mckinleyville and just kept

3256
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:49,119
kept going uh so

3257
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:52,319
so

3258
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:54,158
the the issue though is that like what

3259
01:53:52,319 --> 01:53:57,118
evan wants to talk about now isn't

3260
01:53:54,158 --> 01:53:59,839
unregulated cannabis impacts necessarily

3261
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:01,839
at all like uh certainly he's concerned

3262
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,760
about that and very you know

3263
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,039
not in favor of indoor cannabis you know

3264
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,159
cultivation because of his carbon

3265
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:08,800
footprint

3266
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:09,598
but the really big you know

3267
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:12,480
uh

3268
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:13,760
problems now are in the regulated system

3269
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:15,279
and so this is a critique of

3270
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:17,280
legalization

3271
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:18,479
not just a critique of unregulated

3272
01:54:17,279 --> 01:54:20,559
cannabis

3273
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:22,799
and that in itself is is you know

3274
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:24,239
profoundly important and let's see

3275
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,560
whether it gets the kind of attention

3276
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:28,238
that his previous research did

3277
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:30,400
because his previous research may have

3278
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:32,959
been a little more convenient for

3279
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:33,920
people you know uh that wanted to you

3280
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,639
know

3281
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,158
say

3282
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:38,239
perfectly reasonable things about you

3283
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:40,559
know the carbon footprint issues of of

3284
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:44,399
indoor cultivation but also

3285
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:47,679
uh you know it played a long play played

3286
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:49,598
played into you know um

3287
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:52,158
folks wanting to essentially you know

3288
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:54,000
prohibit or or or reduce the amount of

3289
01:54:52,158 --> 01:54:56,559
cannabis cultivation going on

3290
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,079
in this case now because that is very

3291
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:00,719
inconvenient

3292
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:02,479
uh once again it's an inconvenient truth

3293
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:04,639
but it's inconvenient to the regulators

3294
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:05,919
and and

3295
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:07,279
evan is

3296
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,880
uh

3297
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:10,319
in

3298
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:12,159
fine form

3299
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:14,238
uh you know

3300
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:16,960
addressing political and regulatory

3301
01:55:14,238 --> 01:55:18,959
interests and and corporate interests

3302
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:21,039
that uh you know

3303
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,079
are are making this carbon footprint

3304
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:23,599
issue

3305
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:26,319
you know uh

3306
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:27,440
uh or metastasizing and just growing it

3307
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:28,559
massively

3308
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:30,479
um

3309
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,320
of course with with the climate change

3310
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:35,118
conversation being that much more

3311
01:55:32,319 --> 01:55:36,000
important now than it was ten years ago

3312
01:55:35,118 --> 01:55:37,519
um

3313
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,479
we hope that uh

3314
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:41,760
this is a an intervention that is you

3315
01:55:40,479 --> 01:55:44,000
know

3316
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:46,719
spread as widely and as fast uh as

3317
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,560
quickly as as his prior one

3318
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:51,279
right on well i'm looking forward to

3319
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:53,440
reading it and i am glad that uh that

3320
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:55,279
evan mills is is still in the mix and

3321
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:57,678
still looking into this topic let's

3322
01:55:55,279 --> 01:56:00,079
let's finish off our discussion with uh

3323
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:01,599
the chapter by our mutual friend uh dr

3324
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:04,238
michelle sexton

3325
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:05,840
um this chapter two i'm excited to read

3326
01:56:04,238 --> 01:56:08,559
still because it wasn't in the press

3327
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:11,920
edition because uh dr sex and i have

3328
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:14,800
been discussing that for years the nexus

3329
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:17,920
of institutional science and the good

3330
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:19,679
work done by citizen scientists

3331
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:21,199
and and it's fun because you know like

3332
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:23,039
most of the topics that you cover here

3333
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:26,079
it's a complex one

3334
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:29,039
and and she and i have both um evolved

3335
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:30,960
our ideas you know over our what 10

3336
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:33,279
years as friends and

3337
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:35,359
and and debating this topic and as a

3338
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:38,399
citizen scientist myself i know that

3339
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:40,639
often my sample sizes are low and my

3340
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:42,960
control is perhaps not the most complete

3341
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:45,440
but citizen scientists everywhere are

3342
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:47,920
also working faster than institutions in

3343
01:56:45,439 --> 01:56:49,759
many ways and blazing new paths that

3344
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:51,840
institutional researchers can you know

3345
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:54,400
follow up on later plus i'm hearing

3346
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,719
things from patients who talk to me

3347
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:59,279
that are often you know not insights

3348
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:02,239
that are are being heard um by

3349
01:56:59,279 --> 01:57:04,559
traditional you know clinical doctors

3350
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:07,118
so what are the main arguments in this

3351
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:10,239
chapter on the intersection of cannabis

3352
01:57:07,118 --> 01:57:13,679
citizen science and and institutional or

3353
01:57:10,238 --> 01:57:16,079
academic scientists

3354
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:17,279
well shango that's a very good question

3355
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:19,439
uh

3356
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:22,238
and i also want to

3357
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:24,079
just say that uh you know dr sexton is

3358
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:26,479
an absolutely you know dear friend of

3359
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:27,599
mine and and helped me co-found casp as

3360
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:29,039
as did

3361
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:31,279
sunil aggarwal

3362
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:33,439
uh both contributors to this handbook so

3363
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:37,279
it was especially great to have them

3364
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:38,399
both in here yeah for sure uh and so

3365
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:41,599
really i think

3366
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:44,479
when it comes down to it's you know

3367
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:46,639
michelle is very very concerned

3368
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:46,638
to

3369
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:51,520
address the entanglement of

3370
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:53,039
commercialization and and citizen

3371
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:55,679
science

3372
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:58,238
uh and

3373
01:57:55,679 --> 01:58:00,319
citizen science you know

3374
01:57:58,238 --> 01:58:02,479
is one thing when it's listening to

3375
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:03,519
patients and responding to them

3376
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:07,839
right

3377
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:10,880
and it's another thing when

3378
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:13,199
it's manufacturing claims in the service

3379
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:15,118
of selling you know

3380
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:16,079
uh as much

3381
01:58:15,118 --> 01:58:19,920
you know

3382
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:21,599
cbd as you know distill it as you can

3383
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:22,719
and so like these are kind of the the

3384
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:24,400
divergent

3385
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:26,000
situations like one is kind of the

3386
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:27,279
traditional herbal medicine citizen

3387
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,960
science

3388
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:30,639
that uh

3389
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:32,399
i think uh you know

3390
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:34,239
ten years ago or eight years ago when

3391
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:36,079
you when you might have met her she was

3392
01:58:34,238 --> 01:58:38,559
at the forefront of

3393
01:58:36,079 --> 01:58:39,920
certainly uh first analytics lab in

3394
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:41,280
washington state

3395
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:43,359
um

3396
01:58:41,279 --> 01:58:44,479
a naturopathic doctor

3397
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:46,559
uh

3398
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:48,879
and then kind of this explosion of all

3399
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:51,360
these claims that get made

3400
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:53,118
that are

3401
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:54,799
that have a lot of issues but the

3402
01:58:53,118 --> 01:58:56,960
primary one is that they're incentivized

3403
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:57,920
by essentially the supply chain and

3404
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:59,840
marketing

3405
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:01,118
especially around cbd

3406
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:03,199
um

3407
01:59:01,118 --> 01:59:05,519
and so these this can be problematic for

3408
01:59:03,198 --> 01:59:09,198
several reasons one is just like

3409
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:12,000
taking an anecdote and like you know

3410
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:14,079
uh turning it into a law of nature right

3411
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,279
uh and saying this will always help

3412
01:59:14,079 --> 01:59:17,599
everyone

3413
01:59:15,279 --> 01:59:18,960
just buy this cbd you know that you

3414
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:20,239
could get your

3415
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,599
gas station

3416
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:24,158
right uh

3417
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:26,800
um and the delta eight and everything

3418
01:59:24,158 --> 01:59:27,839
else that's going to gas stations

3419
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:30,440
um

3420
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:33,440
so there are those claims made that are

3421
01:59:30,439 --> 01:59:37,519
bastardizations of citizen science

3422
01:59:33,439 --> 01:59:37,519
uh and i think i'm doing uh um

3423
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:41,440
i think i'm doing her chapter service by

3424
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:43,520
by by clarifying this that there are

3425
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:46,559
those claims that that

3426
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:49,599
they come out of a tradition of you know

3427
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:51,599
healing and patient-centric

3428
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:54,159
you know uh clinical observational

3429
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:55,920
research in particular

3430
01:59:54,158 --> 01:59:57,679
uh that was not possible under

3431
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:59,199
conditions of prohibition

3432
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:01,279
just prohibition not just prohibition

3433
01:59:59,198 --> 02:00:02,960
with uh legalization right

3434
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:05,439
um

3435
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:07,840
and then there is essentially the you

3436
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:11,118
know commercial incentive to take those

3437
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:14,719
claims and completely divorce them

3438
02:00:11,118 --> 02:00:17,598
from the intimate social relationships

3439
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:20,239
that characterize you know uh

3440
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:21,360
traditional herbal medicine

3441
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:23,118
right

3442
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:25,598
and so

3443
02:00:23,118 --> 02:00:27,279
this is i think absolutely

3444
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:29,199
a fantastic intervention that could have

3445
02:00:27,279 --> 02:00:31,439
gone in the public health section

3446
02:00:29,198 --> 02:00:34,079
but we chose to put it in to the culture

3447
02:00:31,439 --> 02:00:36,238
and social change section

3448
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:40,719
because

3449
02:00:36,238 --> 02:00:43,198
it's it's it's about to me

3450
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:45,679
this this cultural difference between

3451
02:00:43,198 --> 02:00:48,158
like the commercialization cult

3452
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:50,719
basically cultures of commercialization

3453
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:51,679
and cultures of care patient-centric

3454
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:52,880
care

3455
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:55,599
right so

3456
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:57,359
citizen science is both

3457
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:59,119
something that helps

3458
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:01,759
and also something

3459
02:00:59,118 --> 02:01:04,719
that others have bastardized basically

3460
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:08,119
to make a bunch of money off of

3461
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:08,118
and so

3462
02:01:08,319 --> 02:01:13,759
that to me makes it an incredibly

3463
02:01:10,158 --> 02:01:15,920
important chapter uh because

3464
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:17,599
what happens is a backlash and i think

3465
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:18,960
you're seeing it a lot actually and you

3466
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:21,760
will see more of it

3467
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:25,920
and the backlash is from you know

3468
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:28,480
policymakers and and health researchers

3469
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:30,560
who instantly see through essentially

3470
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:32,079
the the commercialization of these

3471
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:33,840
claims

3472
02:01:32,079 --> 02:01:36,719
but they don't really

3473
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:38,000
also understand that that that

3474
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,039
the citizen science actually has been

3475
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,960
doing a lot of important work on the

3476
02:01:39,039 --> 02:01:42,479
ground so they discount

3477
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:44,560
really the traditional herbal medicine

3478
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:45,638
thing and and hits their wagons to like

3479
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:48,639
the

3480
02:01:45,639 --> 02:01:51,199
pharmaceuticalization of of of cannabis

3481
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:53,039
entirely right yeah it feels safer to

3482
02:01:51,198 --> 02:01:54,799
them yeah yeah i feel safer they're like

3483
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:57,519
herbal medicine like that's a joke you

3484
02:01:54,800 --> 02:02:00,719
know like look at these cbd companies

3485
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:02,960
uh you know uh and so like

3486
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:05,279
you know michelle shares their distastes

3487
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:06,960
but doesn't have that distaste for

3488
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:08,639
actual like you know

3489
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:10,399
herbal medicine she's she's a

3490
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:12,639
naturopathic doctor

3491
02:02:10,399 --> 02:02:14,479
and so like in many ways it's to

3492
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:16,480
preserve the integrity of

3493
02:02:14,479 --> 02:02:18,000
actually you know the entire

3494
02:02:16,479 --> 02:02:19,279
you know tradition of verbal medicine

3495
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,279
herbal traditional mission which is

3496
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:23,359
finally be becoming recognized in the

3497
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:25,279
united states in the last 30 years

3498
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:28,719
as something that's actually valid

3499
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:31,039
but still is kind of seen as you know

3500
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:34,560
um

3501
02:02:31,039 --> 02:02:36,399
not scientific right because it's not uh

3502
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:38,239
it's not working with molecules and

3503
02:02:36,399 --> 02:02:40,238
standardizations

3504
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:42,238
uh as opposed to herbal medicine which

3505
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:43,919
can work with like the whole plant and

3506
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:46,079
actually address

3507
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:47,440
differences in people's you know body

3508
02:02:46,079 --> 02:02:49,359
chemistry

3509
02:02:47,439 --> 02:02:50,719
that actually standardizing medicine is

3510
02:02:49,359 --> 02:02:53,198
a terrible idea

3511
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:54,960
uh from a certain perspective

3512
02:02:53,198 --> 02:02:57,439
because everybody's bodies are different

3513
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,520
right uh and so

3514
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:02,158
uh it's a really really crucial

3515
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,679
intervention um and and i hope to see

3516
02:03:02,158 --> 02:03:05,839
more of it but

3517
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:07,520
it's really kind of this like

3518
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:10,560
we don't want

3519
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:12,239
cannabis to become snake oil

3520
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:14,159
right like like when it comes down to it

3521
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:14,959
and snake oil is all about marketing

3522
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:16,638
over

3523
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:18,079
you know safety

3524
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:19,440
um

3525
02:03:18,079 --> 02:03:21,920
but safety is not defined by

3526
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:23,678
pharmaceutical procedures like uh that

3527
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,599
is something that is part of the the

3528
02:03:23,679 --> 02:03:27,039
herbal tradition as well

3529
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:29,360
so i

3530
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:31,198
if dr sexton is listening to this i hope

3531
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:32,880
i've i've done her chapter

3532
02:03:31,198 --> 02:03:34,719
uh you know the kind of service it

3533
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:36,159
deserves it's a crucial intervention

3534
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:38,158
well it's also great it was i was very

3535
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:40,638
happy to see dr michelle sexton's

3536
02:03:38,158 --> 02:03:43,198
chapter in the book uh

3537
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:45,920
uh for for a host of reasons but but

3538
02:03:43,198 --> 02:03:48,559
what i like is that she's always been a

3539
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:50,800
friend to the patient first

3540
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:52,320
you know she has been involved you know

3541
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:54,960
advising

3542
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:56,719
different uh companies in cannabis and

3543
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:59,439
and of course she's been working with

3544
02:03:56,719 --> 02:04:01,039
cannabis as an herbalist for uh for a

3545
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:04,319
very long time

3546
02:04:01,039 --> 02:04:07,279
and even myself you know with with with

3547
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:10,399
michelle and i being allies and and

3548
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:13,519
having very similar agendas she would

3549
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:15,519
often catch me and say well you know

3550
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:17,599
shango you're kind of overstating what

3551
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:19,440
we know about cannabis based on your

3552
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:22,400
anecdotal you know

3553
02:04:19,439 --> 02:04:24,238
uh conversations with um with patients

3554
02:04:22,399 --> 02:04:26,638
and and sometimes that would frustrate

3555
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:29,678
me but then then i had to come back to

3556
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:32,639
to what's real and realize that you know

3557
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:35,440
um you know relying too much on hype is

3558
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:38,880
where we get into these problems

3559
02:04:35,439 --> 02:04:42,638
and um you know if dr michelle sexton is

3560
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:43,679
anything she is anti-hype so

3561
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:45,440
so yeah

3562
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:47,440
i'm uh i am grateful for the chapter and

3563
02:04:45,439 --> 02:04:48,238
her participation as well

3564
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:50,319

myself humble state university

3579
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:24,639
sociologist uh

3580
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:26,319
he was he's been just a we've been a

3581
02:05:24,639 --> 02:05:28,719
dream team together and we're doing a

3582
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:30,078
lot of other things together too uh so

3583
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:31,760
i just i'm so grateful for his

3584
02:05:30,078 --> 02:05:34,399
friendship and and

3585
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:36,960
collaboration uh and

3586
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:38,158
he deserves a lot of credit uh as well

3587
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:39,920
and so

3588
02:05:38,158 --> 02:05:41,359
i want to make sure that i don't don't

3589
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:42,560
leave him out but

3590
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:44,719
uh so

3591
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,960
the other thing is of course is that

3592
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:49,279
you can buy the handbook on amazon you

3593
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:51,118
can buy it on routledge.com routledge is

3594
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:52,559
a global academic publisher

3595
02:05:51,118 --> 02:05:54,639
this is the hardback version right now

3596
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,800
there's going to be a a soft cover

3597
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:59,279
that's going to be much less expensive

3598
02:05:56,800 --> 02:06:00,960
the book is you know uh part of the the

3599
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:01,840
routledge handbook series which is sold

3600
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,520
to

3601
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:06,000
universities around the globe basically

3602
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:08,639
and so that's a price that

3603
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:11,599
is essentially reflecting the

3604
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:13,359
the you know business model of routledge

3605
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:14,560
which is that universities are you know

3606
02:06:13,359 --> 02:06:16,719
institutions and they're gonna pay more

3607
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:18,400
for books

3608
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:20,560
and so and then there's also obviously

3609
02:06:18,399 --> 02:06:22,719
an electronic document which is also

3610
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:24,239
often very good for universities to

3611
02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:26,800
to get because then they can their

3612
02:06:24,238 --> 02:06:28,399
students can use it

3613
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:30,079
this is the kind of handbook that is

3614
02:06:28,399 --> 02:06:31,839
going to have a much wider appeal though

3615
02:06:30,078 --> 02:06:35,039
and a bigger audience

3616
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:36,239
and so i recognize that and i want to

3617
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:37,760
make sure that

3618
02:06:36,238 --> 02:06:40,238
folks don't feel like they're you know

3619
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:41,599
economically squeezed out because of the

3620
02:06:40,238 --> 02:06:45,279
the you know

3621
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:47,119
at 25 off 200 uh price of the hardcover

3622
02:06:45,279 --> 02:06:48,719
there will be a soft cover we'll be out

3623
02:06:47,118 --> 02:06:50,399
you know in a few months

3624
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:53,840
and uh you know

3625
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:56,238
uh strongly encourage folks who are

3626
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:58,078
not you know particularly wealthy

3627
02:06:56,238 --> 02:07:00,000
you know not to go out of their way uh

3628
02:06:58,078 --> 02:07:02,078
and get the expensive one but the the

3629
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,920
cheaper one will be available

3630
02:07:02,078 --> 02:07:05,679
