2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,279
i have been interested in the days right

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,959
before death my entire life

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,558
when i was a child my aunt started one

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,440
of the first hospices in the united

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,278
states

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,278
i grew up mowing the lawn of the small

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,879
house that acted as its office

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,480
my mom worked there for almost 20 years

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,079
in grant writing and development

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,760
my dad worked there too in public

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,759
outreach hospice

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,160
death and dying was a constant topic at

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,480
my house it wasn't dark or sad in any

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
way

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
it was just the service my family

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,320
provided in high school i was on the

18
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,000
debate team and we had an entire debate

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,280
season on the topic of euthanasia and

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,119
living wills

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,439
even though debate is a game i learned

22
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,079
the intricacies of what legally defines

23
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,079
life

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,039
and how the state and families play a

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,039
role beside the wishes of the patient

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
and now as an adult talking and teaching

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,760
about cannabis medicine

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,000
people come up to me right at the

29
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,079
grocery store and they got me and they

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,399
asked to talk to them in their car or

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
they stop me after public speeches

32
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,759
and very often they let me know they are

33
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,518
dying and they want to learn about

34
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,359
cannabis relief

35
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,118
i've learned to give an efficient dry

36
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,438
and to the point response

37
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,118
folks seem to appreciate that and off

38
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,798
they go to find some cannabis tincture

39
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,719
with an understanding of dosing and how

40
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,960
to use cannabis

41
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,640
this episode is important because dying

42
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,319
is not cool and there will be no

43
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,200
marketing or information

44
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,319
provided to cannabis folks who are dying

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,478
people who will die

46
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,399
soon and their families need one place

47
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,239
to get most of the information they may

48
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,118
need to get started down this path

49
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,399

oh it's so great to be back

120
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,280
shango well let's get let's get right

121
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,039
into it and make clear what we're

122
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,439
actually talking about today because you

123
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,759
know

124
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,919
a lot of us have heard you know our

125
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,719
friends and family and even the news

126
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,679
talk about

127
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,639
end-of-life care but um except for the

128
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
idea that oh

129
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,919
that person's probably reaching the end

130
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,239
of life we don't

131
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,359
really have a real grasp on what that

132
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,480
might be so

133
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,959
when caregivers use the term end of life

134
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,318
care

135
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,360
what exactly are they saying

136
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,359
well end-of-life care is um

137
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,080
in in this in this country usually

138
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,040
happens in in hospice care

139
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
if most most people um you know when

140
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,400
they are facing

141
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,759
end of life means in hospice your

142
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,918
prognosis is

143
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,439
you have a medical condition which two

144
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,680
doctors certify

145
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,199
that you might have six months or less

146
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
to live

147
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,520
so it's a it's a it's a it's kind of a

148
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,919
care when you have you know that

149
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,519
somebody is near the end of life

150
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,439
and how how do you manage their care

151
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,399
such that you maximize the quality of

152
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:47,918
life uh with the time you have left

153
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,279
and that's that involves a whole range

154
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,758
of

155
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,279
of uh skill sets uh from the care from

156
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,720
the caregiver standpoint from the

157
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,239
medical system standpoint from the

158
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,639
family standpoint

159
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,918
um so you know that's and and that sort

160
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,680
of all falls under the umbrella of

161
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,959
end-of-life care

162
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,038
so how far away from death

163
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,000
does a patient have to be to to i don't

164
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,000
know qualify

165
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,360
for end-of-life care hospice treatment

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,560
because you know in a certain way we're

167
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,000
all terminal right

168
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,038
um but there's there's got to be a

169
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,319
window where it's it's it's so close

170
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,599
that that the strategy changes

171
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,000
yeah that's right i mean that's why

172
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,439
i mentioned hospice at the at the get-go

173
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,360
because this this really is

174
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:34,560
um how we build our system of care so

175
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,960
um hospice is sort of the most intensive

176
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
like um palliative that's another term i

177
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,638
want to let your listeners know about is

178
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,840
palliative care which

179
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,720
grew out of hospice it was the type of

180
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,758
care

181
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,400
palliative means to cover or to cloak

182
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
and so it's a medical specialty it's you

183
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,439
know where you're

184
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,720
working on symptom management really

185
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,160
high quality symptom management

186
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,319
supportive care

187
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,199
uh looking at physical emotional

188
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,039
psychological

189
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,319
spiritual suffering we call that total

190
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,599
pain

191
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,120
and so that type of care happens most

192
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
intensely a hundred percent

193
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,600
in hospice um it's like a palliative

194
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,080
intensive care in hospice

195
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,280
um where and that usually happens at a

196
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,478
patient's home

197
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,439
um and the team comes to them and also

198
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,359
is available by

199
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,478
by phone or you know telemedicine in

200
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,439
these days

201
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:28,000
so that's that's kind of um and that

202
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,959
that really is as a benefit that anybody

203
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
is eligible for

204
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,038
like i said if two doctors say that they

205
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
are potentially six months or less to

206
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,599
live no matter what

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,600
what medical condition that might be

208
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,079
sorry i was just going to say earlier

209
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,600
than that though now but people know

210
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,599
that even you know

211
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,759
patients need need some kind of

212
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,039
palliative care much earlier

213
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,240
than than in being a hospice care um

214
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,478
and and certainly anybody

215
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
you know you're right i mean we could

216
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,639
all benefit from greater quality of life

217
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,079
and better symptom management and

218
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
care for the total pain that we

219
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,918
experience in our lives

220
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,279
which is a very holistic model of care

221
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,038
and definitely that's

222
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,198
that's somebody something that anybody

223
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,800
can benefit no matter their age or

224
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,520
or illness status but um

225
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,240
the the medical field of palliative care

226
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,478
um has decided to focus its efforts

227
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,160
on patients with any anyone who has a

228
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,120
what we call a serious

229
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,360
uh or a life-threatening illness and so

230
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,399
that's at any stage of that illness

231
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,759
so that could be you know years before

232
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,839
somebody might um

233
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,879
you know reach and reach their death we

234
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,000
don't really know

235
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,159
but it is that patients can still be

236
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,319
eligible for that kind of care

237
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,800
even though they're not in hospice it's

238
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,319
just it just happens in a different way

239
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
it's interesting the that that

240
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,960
definition that you gave us for

241
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,318
palliative care

242
00:07:52,959 --> 00:08:00,159
where it is care that is

243
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,879
more holistic and uh taking care of

244
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,599
the whole human instead of just let's

245
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,919
say the

246
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,519
the chemistry and mechanics of the body

247
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,038
when you describe that i thought to

248
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,279
myself well hell that's that's the kind

249
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,719
of

250
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,478
care that i wish i was getting from my

251
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,639
doctor my entire life

252
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,038
and it's just not how we how we do tend

253
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,280
to do things in the united states which

254
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,240
which is interesting um because you know

255
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,279
our general

256
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,000
fear of death in total

257
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,638
um you hit on palliative care and you

258
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,959
hit on

259
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,478
end of life care as far as definitions

260
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,598
go but since so many

261
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,958
people use the term terminal care um why

262
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,640
don't you hit on that too and then your

263
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,679
answer may be it's the same thing but

264
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,918
but but

265
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,958
specifically what do people mean about

266
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,799
terminal care

267
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,799
for folks who are listening and they're

268
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,919
they're trying to decipher

269
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,039
what their doctor is telling them sure i

270
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,679
mean terminal

271
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,240
if your terminal if you get a diagnosis

272
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:57,120
the doctor says you're terminally ill

273
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,519
that just means that you um have a

274
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,799
diagnosis of an illness that

275
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:06,240
um based on statistical tables um

276
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,079
you know will will lead to your death um

277
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,278
you know and that that there's a lot of

278
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
ranges of variable

279
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,480
variability in terms of you know two

280
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,719
years

281
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,920
one year or six months that's there's

282
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,200
like a lot of

283
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:22,240
um variation in that but like

284
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,440
for example uh an illness like uh

285
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,839
als or lou gehrig's disease um

286
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,760
people may live with that for many years

287
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,399
and the decline might be slow

288
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,759
that's where you know the patient might

289
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,759
slowly lose

290
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,200
muscle function and we don't we don't

291
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,879
have a cure for that right now although

292
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
there are some experimental approaches

293
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,120
out there that

294
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,680
might modify the disease but uh you know

295
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,799
so

296
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,479
there's there's another kind of

297
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,679
philosophy or school of thought where

298
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,639
people say well

299
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,079
we say the word terminal too quickly uh

300
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,360
in medicine and that

301
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,360
really it's kind of a um it's it's a

302
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,879
it can be a sort of um what do you call

303
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,759
it like a arrogance

304
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,600
because um we don't really know you know

305
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,159
there are there are definite examples of

306
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,040
spontaneous

307
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,719
remissions there are um you know there

308
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,199
are experimental approaches

309
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,160
and other types of things out there that

310
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,079
you know

311
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,919
uh there are people with stage four

312
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,239
cancer you know who are living

313
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,159
um for many many years now with certain

314
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,839
types of advancements that we have so

315
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,759
if somebody gets a diagnosis of stage

316
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,320
four cancer you know and they say well

317
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,600
that's

318
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,200
that's terminal they might not pursue

319
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,440
those other types of therapies that

320
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,240
you know have are showing effectiveness

321
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,160
for for survival or longevity

322
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,919
so that's why i'm a little i i'm

323
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,319
cautious with the term terminal

324
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,958
um because of the like i said it implies

325
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
a lot

326
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,599
more than we really know but it is

327
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,278
helpful to know the statistical tables

328
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
you know and doesn't necessarily mean

329
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,240
that they all apply to the

330
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,719
individual there's a lot of individual

331
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,200
variation and so that's that's where

332
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,560
that

333
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,079
comes from but we've we've kind of um um

334
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:03,518
i i think we still use it in in hospice

335
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,120
um so that's in hospice care you do

336
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,879
certify that somebody is

337
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
um you know we think we'll have six

338
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,439
months or less but then

339
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,800
what happens people still get ex let's

340
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
say they're living longer because then

341
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,439
now they're having better quality

342
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,360
of life and um and then the doctors have

343
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
to recertify the patient periodically oh

344
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
no they live longer than we thought so

345
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,399
let's

346
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,679
do we still think they're they're

347
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,440
terminal and then they have to go

348
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,359
through a process like that so

349
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,560
that that's it's kind of a it's a moving

350
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,919
target

351
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:34,000
um so just for the clarity of folks um

352
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,759
when we talk about terminal or not

353
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,639
terminal but let's use end of life care

354
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,039
in this case

355
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,919
we're not really looking for a solution

356
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,159
anymore right

357
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,278
because very often on this show we talk

358
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,399
about you know

359
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:49,600
taking large doses of cannabinoids to um

360
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,639
to fight cancer or you know other

361
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,040
um you know traditionally terminal

362
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,879
diseases but but really by the time

363
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,039
you're in end-of-life care

364
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,078
the goal really isn't to okay what are

365
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,719
the ways that we can

366
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,519
we can stop this it's really about how

367
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,320
can we make you

368
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,839
comfortable how can we make you mentally

369
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,120
present so that you can interact with

370
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,839
your family

371
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,120
how can we decrease your pain so you can

372
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,440
experience some joy

373
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,159
and maybe a little bit of

374
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,639
self-actualization um

375
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:21,519
before your last breaths but it's not

376
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,560
really about curing you anymore right

377
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,480
well you know people still uh

378
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,759
people can still have hope for that kind

379
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,278
of thing if they

380
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,600
we don't we don't want to um discourage

381
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,360
that you can still have that kind of

382
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
care uh you can see you can have the

383
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,919
care exactly as you describe the

384
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,879
impeccable a management of comfort

385
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,519
family support

386
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,159
psycho spiritual physical health and

387
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,278
healing

388
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,278
in terms of quality of life you know

389
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,399
improving your like you said your mental

390
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:51,600
acuity or just

391
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,759
physical comfort all the different

392
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,720
layers and then making sure that your

393
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,919
family is

394
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,480
also cared for and has support and we

395
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,799
usually accomplish this with not just

396
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,320
like one doctor or one nurse but really

397
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,000
like a whole team of

398
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,079
we call a multi-disciplinary team of

399
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,958
specialists like chaplains social

400
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,120
workers

401
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,239
you know integrative therapy um

402
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,720
acupuncture

403
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,039
providers or reiki or any you know

404
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,200
there's a there's very broad range of

405
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,480
specialties that get involved to to make

406
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
that

407
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,000
that kind of care um possible uh at the

408
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,920
end of life

409
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,360
but at the same time a patient might say

410
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,639
well you know i'm

411
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,800
i still want to take my ex

412
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,320
you know because even though that that

413
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,559
might

414
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,240
might be like an experimental therapy

415
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,838
you know to help a patient to see if

416
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,240
that'll um

417
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,880
improve their the length of time that

418
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
they have

419
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,919
or or slow the disease that's that's not

420
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
a

421
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,120
incompatible with that and patients

422
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,680
still have a right to

423
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,360
explore experimental treatments even

424
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,159
while they're on hospice

425
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,959
it's just generally the hospice the

426
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,639
medical

427
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,799
medicare which is usually most patients

428
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,120
in the hospice or medicare

429
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,078
they don't pay for that care they do let

430
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,679
you see a doctor

431
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,519
on the outside one doctor on the outside

432
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,958
like your old primary doctor or somebody

433
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,120
else so

434
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,000
so there there is a way to still have

435
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,240
hospice care

436
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
high quality of life care and still

437
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,039
explore the other aspects that you're

438
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,320
talking about but of course i'm

439
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,679
the we we we don't the end of life care

440
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
folks are focused on

441
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,719
how to make that quality of life as good

442
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,879
as possible so

443
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,160
so that um no matter what the patient is

444
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,159
doing um

445
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,198
you know that's that's the best possible

446
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,759
day and

447
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,198
and then also the people who live on

448
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,559
after the patient that they're they're

449
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,599
not racked with um

450
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:44,399
complicated grief or um you know

451
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,399
trauma from the um from from their loved

452
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,120
ones um

453
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,559
so right on so so just for the sake of

454
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,639
clarification because

455
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,159
of the particular audience that i have

456
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,159
you know you you said that the the

457
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,879
patient may still want to be taking

458
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,919
their ex

459
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,320
and it's a you know a a a it may be an

460
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,120
uh

461
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,160
you know not totally researched or

462
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
finished

463
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,639
um uh medicine or whatever when you say

464
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,720
x you meant like a variable

465
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,079
like whatever pharmaceutical that they

466
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
were getting good relief on you

467
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,679
are not referring to ecstasy mdma

468
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,079
correct oh yeah

469
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,078
yeah on another show you wouldn't have

470
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,719
to clarify that but on this show you do

471
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,159
so we work with a whole lot of different

472
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,160
entheogens so

473
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,600
although i mean certainly we can talk

474
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,838
about in theogens and and

475
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
and then pharmaceutical endogens like uh

476
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,440
mdma here

477
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,159
or the cogeners mdma is like similar to

478
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
um

479
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,078
you know uh something from sassafras

480
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,958
ceferol

481
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,120
and that um these are you know and and

482
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:46,319
and also has similar it's similar to

483
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,039
um masculine and it's been mescaline's

484
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,360
been used for

485
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,639
you know thousand years at least or more

486
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,399
in in in

487
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,159
different types of healing like holistic

488
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,958
healing that we're talking about so

489
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,159
there's definitely a uh like that we can

490
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,000
talk about that too

491
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,838
but i was referring to in that context

492
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,679
like if anybody wants to

493
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
sort of use i've had a lot of patients

494
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,519
in hospice that continue to use

495
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,879
different like supplements or natural

496
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,959
medicines um

497
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,958
that are you know they hope that have

498
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,638
anti-cancer activity for example

499
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,559
but at the same time they're receiving

500
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,639
high quality hospice care so

501
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,838
it's it's still possible to have that

502
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,240
hope of

503
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,240
of um having something to you know do

504
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,120
something about the disease process

505
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,839
uh but also being under the care of a

506
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,679
team that's

507
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,040
really focusing on your um comfort and

508
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,799
quality of life so

509
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,399
so while we're probably not gonna have

510
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,919
time to get into

511
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,679
the the mdma mimic that you just

512
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,958
suggested which is like

513
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,319
um uh mescaline and from a root

514
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,638
i know that there's a lot of people

515
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,320
whose ears just perked up like mine did

516
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
can you just give us a quick search term

517
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,600
for folks who want to look that up like

518
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,120
what what would they google to find out

519
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,879
more about this preparation you're

520
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,159
talking about

521
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,360
oh oh sassafras root yeah oh it's

522
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,360
sassafras okay

523
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,278
yeah that was that was just i was just

524
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,959
giving an example of

525
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:09,759
like you know it's a mdma was made

526
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,839
in german by german chemist in the 19th

527
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,400
early 1900's

528
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,838
but its chemical structure is very

529
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,360
similar to

530
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:21,359
um chemical that's been used in

531
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,798
natural medicine for a long time uh

532
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,198
sassafras oil

533
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,959
an ingredient in sassafras oil um so

534
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,679
that's all i was just sort of tying it

535
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,240
back to

536
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,440
back to a natural um cogener or

537
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
something in nature that it's very

538
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,080
similar to

539
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,519
and then i was also tying it to the

540
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,759
class of of um

541
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,200
compounds called phenylethylamines

542
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,200
phenylethylamines um

543
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,759
are are you know what mdma is like that

544
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,798
and

545
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,079
um and then there are naturally

546
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,319
occurring phenylethylamine

547
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,199
mescaline as your listeners might have

548
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,599
heard of so

549
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,759
i was i was just giving you some some

550
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,519
you threw mdma over there

551
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,440
and talked about anthogen so i wanted to

552
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,879
one of my interests is this class of

553
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,360
compounds and i think they're

554
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,480
they have a huge role to play in um in

555
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,359
end-of-life care and

556
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,960
and we're getting a lot of uh research

557
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,399
studies on that nowadays so

558
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,840
uh it's even more um compelling um

559
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,200
and um and i i'm i'm incorporating some

560
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,759
of that in my practice but we can talk

561
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,640
about that

562
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,798
later right on so because cannabis is

563
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,440
such a versatile healing herb you know

564
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,359
it's it's used for a wide range of

565
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,279
relief in all sorts of ways capsules and

566
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,399
vaped and tinctures and suppositories

567
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,759
and smoked

568
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,600
but you know as as a doctor you know

569
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,440
who still has um a very active clinical

570
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,038
life and you are seeing patients and

571
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,440
families all the time

572
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,879
i i imagine that even though there's a

573
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,200
wide range of

574
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,400
possible um uses for cannabis

575
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,919
that um that there are some that come

576
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,080
up more often what are these uses that

577
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,160
come up more often that you see

578
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,240
um when actually dealing with real life

579
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,360
patients

580
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,200
well cannabis is a widely

581
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:13,279
utilized um for managing the

582
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:18,080
pain managing fatigue

583
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:22,000
managing insomnia managing

584
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,000
like nausea and vomiting

585
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,599
the those are some of the uh did i

586
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,159
mention mood

587
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,519
i think i think though that that there's

588
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,640
like

589
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:37,119
a whole symptom cluster that

590
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,480
um you know cannabis can help patients

591
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,279
with and that's

592
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,720
that's exactly um what i have seen in my

593
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,440
practice and encourage

594
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,160
patients that um have access to cannabis

595
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,720
um who are

596
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,519
at um you know in in end-of-life care

597
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,919
settings

598
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,440
it's not it's not always easy to to make

599
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,960
that access thing happen i know we're

600
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,440
going to talk about that later

601
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,720
but when you do have access to cannabis

602
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,960
it can do a lot of work

603
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,600
to take care of these um really

604
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,519
difficult symptoms that

605
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:10,399
normally doctors would prescribe opioids

606
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,639
and benzodiazepines and some

607
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,559
pharmaceutical anti-nausea medicines to

608
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,679
treat

609
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:20,558
it is really interesting isn't it how

610
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,559
some of the some of the symptoms that

611
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,558
patients want relief for

612
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,079
are are some of the more basic things

613
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,200
that cannabis helps with like

614
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:32,158
nausea and pain and just general

615
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,440
muscle tension stress anxiety about

616
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,559
being sick

617
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,640
and and yet um you know once folks start

618
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:42,000
taking it for that they start to realize

619
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,720
all these other benefits like oh gosh my

620
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
my my ibs has gone away or my headaches

621
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,079
have gone away and

622
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,200
and and then suddenly now they're now

623
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,359
they're taking it for

624
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,798
a much wider range of symptoms than they

625
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,558
are originally taking it for

626
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,079
because once they have first-person

627
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,558
experience with it they're like oh my

628
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,240
god where's this been all my life

629
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,720
you got it that's right it's called i

630
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,359
call those side benefits as opposed to

631
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,240
side effects

632
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,759
so so um we're going to go to the we're

633
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,038
going to go to a break soon

634
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,480
and then we're going during the second

635
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,839
set we're going to talk much more

636
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,480
specifically about

637
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,000
using cannabis for end-of-life care but

638
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
yeah i want to before we go i want to

639
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,400
make sure

640
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,079
that we we talk about how this process

641
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,440
gets started you know

642
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:30,319
when cannabis comes up do you

643
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,880
find that it's normally you as the

644
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,599
doctor

645
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,559
who is mentioning it to the patient and

646
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,719
their family

647
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,798
or do you find that usually it's the

648
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,600
patient who has found out about it on

649
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,599
their own

650
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,439
and they are requesting this guidance

651
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,599
from you

652
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,200
well shingo i would say that the answer

653
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,678
to that question has shifted

654
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
quite a bit over the the last you know

655
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,798
10

656
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,759
i guess i've been i've been interacting

657
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,158
with patients

658
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,359
um you know as a professional medical

659
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,880
student or something for

660
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:03,279
almost 20 years so the situation

661
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,720
from the first half of my career

662
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,678
practice has shifted

663
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,640
where um to initially where i was

664
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,720
bringing it up more

665
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,400
to now where patients are already

666
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,279
already know about this and are bringing

667
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,080
it up for

668
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,200
for more specialized guidance so it's

669
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,599
it's it's really

670
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,480
um you know that now of course that

671
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,319
changes

672
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,919
in terms of demographics that you're

673
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,839
you're you're working with

674
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,640
um you know what is the age range the

675
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:31,279
patient what is their ethnic background

676
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,640
um what kind of setting are they in like

677
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,839
in a nursing home or

678
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,919
hospital or in a community setting so

679
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,199
it's really those variables and then now

680
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,520
i'm in a practice where

681
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,558
you know cannabis is very prominently um

682
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,558
featured on our

683
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,639
or you know on our materials and and

684
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:49,918
people know me for that kind of work so

685
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,000
it's um i end up getting patients who

686
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,840
already know about it and are

687
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,759
more like well yeah i know it can be

688
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,399
helpful i've tried it but i don't really

689
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,079
know how to

690
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
i need to kind of refine that or i need

691
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,319
more guidance so a lot of times patients

692
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,159
are bringing it up

693
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,000
well actually that's a that's a great uh

694
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,120
transition so our next set is going to

695
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,839
be all about

696
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,959
um refining and patient understanding of

697
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,240
how best to use

698
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,840
cannabis so that'll be great let's go

699
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,960
ahead and get this first commercial out

700

[Music]

735
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,158
as a business owner you are incredibly

736
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,439
busy in reality you are responsible for

737
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,278
everything your company does

738
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,960
you've got so many responsibilities

739
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,240
every single day that often you just

740
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,319
don't have the time to really

741
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,278
dig into your marketing as deeply as

742
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,480
you'd like

743
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,159
you know there's more that you could do

744
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,759
to reach out to new customers and

745
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,480
encourage loyalty in the customers you

746
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,079
already have

747
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,519
but you certainly don't have the time

748
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,839
for it and you're not ready to hire

749
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,720
somebody full time for that role either

750
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,798
for you i recommend blunt branding at

bottom line

754
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,639
you know most marketing firms are

755
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,038
excited to make your logo

756
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,120
packaging and website very pretty but

757
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,960
they leave responsibility for improving

758
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,000
your bottom line up to you

759
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,000
they don't want that kind of

760
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,919
responsibility but that's pretty much

761
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,960
the most important part of marketing

762
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,400

763
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640

point of sale whether it be

766
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,520
online or a storefront and keep them

767
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,480
coming back to you and telling their

768
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,319
friends

769

781
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,320
team put together a whole brand package

782
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
for them

783
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,079
built their website and wrote their

784
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,600
sales materials no doubt this is a paid

785
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,960
commercial spot but that does not mean

786
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,959
they bought my opinion

787
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
i've worked with blunt branding on five

788
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,200
projects now for various of their

789
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,798
clients and

790
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,159
every single time they have done more

791
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:57,599
than they have promised and over

792
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,679
delivered on results

793
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,519
i love how they generate new revenue and

794
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,679
focus on that as the goal instead of

795
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,519
just making a pretty logo

796
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,200
similarly every single friend i have

797
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:07,599
referred them to has come back to thank

798

me

799
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,439
and that just does not happen every day

800
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,798
grab a pen and paper because the website

801

00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:12,079
topic started on cannabis medicine

866
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,600
um during this set we're going to talk a

867
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,480
lot more about the how

868
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,918
right as as sunil was talking about

869
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,278
before we went to break

870
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,038
um there's a lot of different ways to

871
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,599
use cannabis and not all of them

872
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,480
are appropriate for for each kind of

873
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,798
ailment

874
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,000
now before we get into those specifics i

875
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,398
want to point out that

876
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,440
there is no way that we are going to get

877
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,319
through

878
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,919
all of the different ailments and ways

879
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,558
that cannabis can help

880
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,440
um during this show or or during one of

881
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:41,278
any show

882
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,360
and so there's i want to refer you to a

883

migraines with cannabis with dr ethan

907
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,480
russo

908
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,720
so um so with that um sunil you know

909
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,599
most people think of using cannabis

910
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,038
medicine by

911
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,319
smoking a joint right just because

912
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,558
that's kind of what the picture that

913
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,038
they have in their head from culture

914
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,759
but really smoking's not usually the

915
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,440
proper

916
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:55,200
form for most patients both because

917
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,320
uh the dosing comes on so fast and also

918
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,278
most terminal or end-of-life patients

919
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,079
are are not usually a location that that

920
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,278
smoking

921
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,720
is um you know appropriate because

922
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,200
they're they're likely indoors and

923
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,679
perhaps

924
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,480
in some kind of an institutional setting

925
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,038
so so

926
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,480
what when when people ask you about well

927
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,798
well doc should i get some

928
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,278
cannabis flower to smoke what do you how

929
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:22,398
do you interpret that for them

930
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,679
yeah i also the other i i say the same

931
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,879
thing you just said

932
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:30,320
and also the fact that with smoking you

933
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,919
um it doesn't last as long it might

934
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,839
might be quick to come on which actually

935
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,799
can be nice and helpful

936
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,879
and for that reason i don't i try to if

937
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,679
a patient has the accessibility

938
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,200
to have vaporizers access dry flower

939
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,798
vaporizer or

940
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,360
or clean a clean oil that's vaporizable

941
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,639
without

942
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,678
pesticides or solvents um and you know

943
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,159
any excipients

944
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,798
so there are oils can be vaporized too

945
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,960
and and

946
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,240
inhalation is can be really effective

947
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,600
when you need relief like

948
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,319
now and you don't need that much

949
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,879
so you're fast acting and titratable you

950
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,158
know

951
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,840
as i'm sure your listeners know is

952
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,320
there's so many advantages of that route

953
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,480
but

954
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,319
the disadvantages are like you said

955
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,440
context environment that might not be

956
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,079
conducive to that

957
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,919
and also the uh the fact that um you

958
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,519
know your relief might not be as long

959
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,120
lasting because the onset

960
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,679
and and and fall-off is is short

961
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,798
so i just kind of educate patients about

962
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,200
that and that

963
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,000
if you do smoke you know the institute

964
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,278
of medicine

965
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,079
uh 99 their earlier report on cannabis

966
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:36,880
and in end of life care you know um they

967
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,199
said that

968
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,240
yeah hey you know the risks would be uh

969
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,519
outweighed by the

970
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,440
i mean the benefits will be updated with

971
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,000
the risk risks of smoking in patients

972
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,320
who are

973
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
terminal or end of life so we don't

974
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,519
really

975
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,200
i mean if a patient wants to do that and

976
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,079
and likes that and likes the flavor the

977
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,798
taste

978
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,319
you know um that approach and they have

979
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:57,200
a setting that's conducive to that i'm

980
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,439
not gonna

981
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,399
i'm not gonna you know stop that or get

982
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,960
because

983
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,158
that yeah there are risks like soot um

984
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,679
you know coughing

985
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,600
um and of course you mentioned the

986
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,399
respiratory sensitive individuals in

987
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,759
that earlier

988
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:13,518
show you had on copd um so those are the

989
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,038
those are the risks but if if they're

990
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,880
okay with those things or

991
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,480
and and i think i still think it's worth

992
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,200
supporting patients to do that it's a

993
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,759
very

994
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,960
old method of use and it might be part

995
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,798
of their tradition

996
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,600
it might be part of their um you know

997
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,278
the the sensual aspects of cannabis

998
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,278
and i i didn't get to mention that in

999
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,200
the last section that cannabis is also

1000
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:36,398
useful for patients at end of life

1001
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,798
on on improving you know their um

1002
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,518
sense of being and well just overall

1003
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,000
general

1004
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,440
psycho-emotional spiritual wellness and

1005
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
so anything that's going to help connect

1006
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,440
them to

1007
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,599
a tradition or a aroma that feels

1008
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,519
you know comforting is is great so

1009
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,839
that's that's all the big caveat i would

1010
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,558
say

1011
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,720
to patients about that i like how you

1012
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,759
put point that out about the tradition

1013
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,038
culture and the um i don't know the

1014
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:02,720
emotional connection

1015
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,359
with flower because it really is

1016
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,360
different isn't it between people who

1017
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,359
are learning about cannabis and starting

1018
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,839
to use it for the first time at end of

1019
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,839
life versus a lifelong user

1020
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,678
of cannabis who is using it at end of

1021
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,720
life i mean i have gone to so many

1022
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,640
patient events where

1023
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,759
you know you've got these these these

1024
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,278
older

1025
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,200
folks who've been smoking weed their

1026
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:26,319
whole life and you know

1027
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,440
they look so much more at ease and in

1028
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,798
their realm when they've got a joint and

1029
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,038
there's smoke in it and for me

1030
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:34,798
as an asthmatic i'm like oh you know all

1031
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,839
that combustion and all that heat

1032
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,319
that's not you know for me um that in

1033
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,839
that it

1034
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,359
makes it harder to breathe and isn't

1035
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,439
great but but you see these

1036
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,398
you see these folks and like it's it's

1037
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,640
been their release from anxiety and part

1038
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:52,319
of their social world for so long

1039
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,880
i discourage people to you know

1040
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,558
try to have those people switch to you

1041
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,440
know something else

1042
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,200
just because they are you know dealing

1043
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,038
with end-of-life care

1044
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,960
because you don't want to take from them

1045
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,440
something that they have been using

1046
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,000
effectively their entire life you know

1047
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,960
let

1048
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,760
the the they're going to get the the

1049
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,119
muscle relaxation the anti-anxiety the

1050
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,720
increase in appetite you know they're

1051
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,200
gonna get the basics whether or not

1052
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,918
they're

1053
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,799
you know smoking and combusting a joint

1054
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,000
or

1055
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,679
using a vaporizer but gosh you know

1056
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,358
let them let them let them use it the

1057
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,159
way that they want to

1058
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,000
yeah exactly we our philosophies often

1059
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,960
don't take away what people it's already

1060
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,039
working for them

1061
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,119
but maybe you can add to it or

1062
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,559
supplement you know as long as it's safe

1063
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,320
um so i i you know then i would educate

1064
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,799
patients about the value of tinctures

1065
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,639
you know

1066
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,679
um or or suppositories or method or oral

1067
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,320
edible route

1068
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,440
the you know if they aren't um that that

1069
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,599
they could add that in

1070
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,480
and enhance the benefit that they're

1071
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,879
getting

1072
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,920
um so that that's sort of how i approach

1073
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,519
that like it's

1074
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,000
both and you know yeah possible and so

1075
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,838
but before

1076
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,358
we move on from smoking so i guess again

1077
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,679
essentially the summary is is

1078
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,799
if if there's no uh health reason for

1079
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,879
the patient to

1080
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,400
stop smoking and they love smoking

1081
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,960
joints let them

1082
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,000
you know go about their their way that

1083
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,358
they always have

1084
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,239
but if um if there are lung issues

1085
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,759
um or or if they might be able to be

1086
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,479
allowed to do this indoors

1087
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,880
you know consider a flower vaporizer

1088
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,240
which

1089
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,200
um you know honestly i've heard from so

1090
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,439
many patients

1091
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,358
who they just close their door and they

1092
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,960
vape in their room in an institution

1093
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:38,159
that's federally funded and it's not

1094
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,720
allowed but because

1095
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,719
you know vaporization isn't smoke it

1096
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,519
doesn't get the same kind of attention

1097
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,959
from staff

1098
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:49,519
and so um you know that's that and so

1099
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,240
you know be aware of vaporization as an

1100
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,039
option

1101
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:56,078
um but don't think it's the only option

1102
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:59,039
um just because somebody's sick

1103
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,519
so so let's move on to capsules so um

1104
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,079
you know

1105
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,079
uh capsules are good for many patients

1106
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,359
because of the ease of use right there's

1107
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,640
there's no smell

1108
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,199
it's it's discrete um it's it's very

1109
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,960
easy

1110
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,199
with the dexterity of the fingers you

1111
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,400
know to just take a capsule versus

1112
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,960
you know roll a joint or or you know

1113
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,000
take tincture or things like that but um

1114
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,320
but it's not so

1115
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,760
good for some folks with like throat and

1116
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,440
some stomach issues so

1117
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,800
so please speak to your experience about

1118
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
capsules

1119
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,000
yeah you got it i mean a capsule can

1120
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,358
basically people talk about um

1121
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,559
encapsulating

1122
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:40,239
in usually like cellulose capsules

1123
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:42,799
um various extracts of cannabis

1124
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,319
some people just use raw fla or heated

1125
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,079
up flour

1126
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,920
and ground up you know cannabis flour

1127
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,240
or more commonly an oil extraction

1128
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,079
like a coconut oil extraction or you

1129
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,358
know a glycerin

1130
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,560
um and then you and then your alcohol

1131
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,480
extraction and then you

1132
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,239
you just take take a chunk of that and

1133
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,559
then fill it into a capsule

1134
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,479
and there you have an encapsulated um

1135
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,599
cannabis product which

1136
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,519
um you know as you said by you it

1137
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,559
bypasses it's not the lungs it's not the

1138
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:16,639
oral mucosa

1139
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:17,679
it goes straight to the stomach and in

1140
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,000
the small intestine

1141
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,519
it um you know absorbs the absorption is

1142
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,679
more variable

1143
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:25,280
but it's still it's longer lasting and

1144
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,480
if you have if you take it with a fatty

1145
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,760
meal

1146
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,000
you know or oil drink sip some oil

1147
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,119
it'll improve the absorption ability and

1148
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,800
then it goes

1149
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,160
has first pass effect through the liver

1150
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,440
so you get more potent

1151
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,519
and if you're working with a thc you get

1152
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,960
11 hydroxy thc which is

1153
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,838
more potent and you know you can have

1154
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,240
several hours

1155
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,559
of of effectiveness and you know all you

1156
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:53,519
had to do was just swallow one capsule

1157
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,159
so that's very convenient and um you

1158
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,480
know i think

1159
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,358
uh can can do a lot of um good for

1160
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
patients

1161
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,679
uh for for the symptom clusters and um

1162
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
that we were talking about before so

1163
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,239
yeah it's

1164
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,000
it's very i i think you're right the

1165
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,479
swallowing challenges are there

1166
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,920
uh i've had some patients um i've heard

1167
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,240
about patients that

1168
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,280
just skip the uh who have feeding tubes

1169
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,559
in um

1170
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,760
and um i had a doctor teacher a doctor

1171
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,519
who was a teacher of miami medical

1172
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,160
school and she told me stories how they

1173
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,960
would just

1174
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,118
in the 80s uh somebody who hadn't used

1175
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,079
cannabis for for nausea vomiting symptom

1176
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,480
relief

1177
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,680
but couldn't swallow so they would just

1178
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,719
they made an oil

1179
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:35,279
um and dripped it into the

1180
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,919
opening of the uh food the feeding tube

1181
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,920
yeah

1182
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,400
so that's the you know sometimes you got

1183
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,358
to just skip the entire upper

1184
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,440
gut upper gi and go straight to the the

1185
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,279
opening that patients use

1186
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,119
yeah wow that's that's that's

1187
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,720
extraordinary i've not heard of that

1188
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,400
before

1189
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,319
one of the interesting things about

1190
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,880
capsules and you hit on it just a moment

1191
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,680
ago

1192
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,838
that there are there are some uh uh

1193
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,319
stomach issues that you have to avoid it

1194
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,279
because

1195
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,079
even though cannabis is good for stomach

1196
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,480
issues

1197
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,240
the capsule itself is irritating for

1198
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,599
lots of different types of patients and

1199
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,919
so

1200
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,359
it's weird to say that you know cannabis

1201
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,680
is great for stomach issues and

1202
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:19,039
digestive issues with it which it is

1203
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,159
but a the method the capsule itself may

1204
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,960
be the irritant

1205
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,598
so you know patients patients and

1206
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,838
caregivers

1207
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,200
they'll get more sophisticated as as as

1208
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,279
we go with this

1209
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,960
um you mentioned a wide range of things

1210
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,160
that could be in capsules

1211
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,760
uh you know from um you know uh

1212
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,199
just just uh flour that has been put

1213
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,320
into a capsule

1214
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,399
um and and then oils and then and then

1215
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,640
whatever type of combinations that they

1216
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,440
might purchase at a at a uh

1217
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:49,920
at a recreational legal cannabis store

1218
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
um

1219
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,200
i think it's probably a good idea for us

1220
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,079
to mention that if you

1221
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,039
are interacting you know if you're using

1222
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,720
uh

1223
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:03,199
capsules that are homemade versus

1224
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,118
capsules that are store-bought you're

1225
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:06,480
going to want to make sure that you take

1226
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,400
you know at least one of these capitals

1227
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,760
maybe a few if they're if you think that

1228
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,318
there might be a lot of variability to

1229
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,520
them

1230
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,039
and go ahead and drop them off at a a

1231
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,519
cannabis

1232
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:18,800
analytics lab hopefully you know if you

1233
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,239
don't have one in your state you'll have

1234
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,000
one soon

1235
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,639
the point i'm trying to make is that

1236
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,519
dosage is very relevant when it comes to

1237
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,759
this because

1238
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:30,000
you know one of the big aspects of

1239
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,040
medical cannabis is repeatability of

1240
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,599
results

1241
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,318
you don't want to have a patient who is

1242
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,640
taking

1243
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,440
you know a particular dosage of a

1244
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,759
cannabis

1245
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,280
product consistently and then all of a

1246
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,240
sudden they take the eighth or ninth

1247
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,800
capsule

1248
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,679
and and now they're over the moon high

1249
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,480
because

1250
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,559
um there's so much variability in it so

1251
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,559
so i'm a big fan of people

1252
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,920
you know making their own cannabis

1253
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,799
medicine but

1254
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,480
um would you agree that the the

1255
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,039
repeatability of results

1256
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,240
is essential when it comes to this type

1257
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,279
of care

1258
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:08,000
absolutely yeah if you if you can get to

1259
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,560
a lab uh if that if you're in a state

1260
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,239
where you have access as a patient or as

1261
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,519
a consumer

1262
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,399
um why not utilize it it's good to know

1263
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,960
how much

1264
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,760
you know at least the the potency no

1265
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,400
there's other

1266
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,839
testing for safety too you know if you

1267
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,838
got it from some place and you're not

1268
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:26,559
sure the pesticide content or heavy

1269
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,159
metal

1270
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:32,719
residue so those are also important for

1271
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,759
safety purposes

1272
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,480
and um and then potency is great too so

1273
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,119
you can know

1274
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,800
okay i'm i'm trying to i want to get

1275
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,519
five milligrams of thc

1276
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,839
and 25 milligrams of cbd or or i want to

1277
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,679
have a high cthc low cbd

1278
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,920
or you know i want to i want to some

1279
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,639
places offer terpene testing

1280
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,838
so those kind of things will give you a

1281
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,000
chance to

1282
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,000
to understand more about what your

1283
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,199
responsiveness is and and what you might

1284
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,280
need to adjust

1285
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:02,399
to maximize the response you're looking

1286
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,960
for so it's

1287
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,838
it's very uh it's very helpful though i

1288
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,679
it's hard

1289
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,358
some places don't have it and sometimes

1290
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,399
the testing is expensive

1291
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,000
so um those are the draw the limitations

1292
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,599
sure and and while we're talking about

1293
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,358
limitations let's let's hit on the

1294
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,640
limitations of capsules we've already

1295
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,799
hit on the fact that

1296
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,118
that the actual act of swallowing them

1297
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,920
can be an impedement for

1298
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,119
many patients but also the the putting

1299
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,838
them together the actual

1300
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,440
physical capping them up is is very

1301
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,279
likely going to be something that

1302
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,119
is going to be difficult for the patient

1303
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,319
and gosh it's it's also very possible

1304
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,318
that it's going to be difficult for the

1305
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:40,079
family members too because making caps

1306
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,480
is not the easiest thing

1307
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,480
uh unless you've got you know very fully

1308
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,358
functioning phalanges you know

1309
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,519
and so there is a capsule making

1310
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,639
machines you can get which we sometimes

1311
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,480
patients benefit from

1312
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,199
simplifying their lives you know it's

1313
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,440
like an auto auto capper

1314
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,719
absolutely and and you know for somebody

1315
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,039
who is

1316
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,559
uh uh working in end-of-life care and

1317
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,119
it's not going to be immediate that

1318
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,838
might be

1319
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,240
that may make a lot of sense um the

1320
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:07,838
thing

1321
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,439
the biggest drawback for me when

1322
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,039
recommending capsules to patients though

1323
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,519
is the fact that you're you're kind of

1324
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,960
uh

1325
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,920
tied to the preset dosage that's in the

1326
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,280
capsule

1327
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,838
and i'm a big fan of uh

1328
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,400
variability and dosing uh from day to

1329
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,119
day

1330
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,800
uh based on the patient's needs so they

1331
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,280
can titrate themselves

1332
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,960
and for this um tinctures become very

1333
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,319
popular

1334
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,880
what have you seen as far as like the

1335
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,079
the benefits of a patient being able to

1336
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,960
control

1337
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,160
their dosage up or down based on their

1338
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,358
day

1339
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:48,239
oh let's yeah that's very

1340
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:48,639
beneficial especially when you're um you

1341
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:50,799
know

1342
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,879
struggling with getting your regimen

1343
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,800
right or you're in the early phases for

1344
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,480
for patients who you know kind of

1345
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,640
already know what their

1346
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,519
what their sweet spot is what their um

1347
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,440
you know about

1348
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:02,639
amount of medicine that's going to

1349
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,200
improve their um

1350
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:05,679
whatever symptom or you know global

1351
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:07,358
cluster

1352
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,279
they're treating and then it's some

1353
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,039
capsules you know can be a simple

1354
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,800
sort of fix but if you haven't really

1355
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,960
nailed that down there's nothing like

1356
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,000
the tincture

1357
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,159
um to really help to um kind of

1358
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,480
play with okay let me half a milliliter

1359
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,799
here there or quarter mil

1360
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,000
um increments just to kind of see what

1361
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,400
happens

1362
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,039
and that's we call that auto titration

1363
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,599
um it's

1364
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,559
it was this it was a back in the day uh

1365
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,160
when we were still

1366
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,679
fighting where whether we can even you

1367
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:36,159
know have medical marijuana and all

1368
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,919
these

1369
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:39,519
states that we have it now there was all

1370
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,358
this you know

1371
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:42,960
um there would be this the conservative

1372
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,719
establishment would say oh well

1373
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,400
gosh you know there's no there's no

1374
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,318
single dose and that's that's terrible

1375
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,559
like what kind of medicine is that

1376
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,079
and um and then we'd go back and say

1377
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,519
well no this is even this is called auto

1378
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,519
titration you can actually

1379
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,119
you would the patient can self-adjust

1380
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,719
their dose based on what they what their

1381
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,519
need is and how they respond because

1382
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:02,559
there's so much

1383
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,318
variability in you know each individual

1384
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,078
patient's endocannabinoid tone their

1385
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,400
absorption their

1386
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,760
metabolism of different cannabinoids and

1387
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,519
they're based on their their

1388
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,680
genetic profile so it's um it's really a

1389
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,519
it's a huge asset to to cannabis

1390
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,799
medicine to have this

1391
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:23,039
ability to safely you know

1392
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,599
have little slight scales of sl you know

1393
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,199
sliding joe sliding skills so to speak

1394
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,280
it's interesting too how different

1395
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,480
patients use that variability that

1396
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,400
sliding scale

1397
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,880
uh differently than each other for

1398
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,039
example i have seen about the same

1399
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:41,039
number of patients who

1400
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:43,279
have a smaller dose of thc and a higher

1401
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,400
dose of cbg and cbd

1402
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,440
in the morning and and then maybe a

1403
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,280
little bit more

1404
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,559
by day time as their body is getting a

1405
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,040
little more sore

1406
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,799
and then by evening when they've already

1407
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:55,920
you know visited with their family and

1408
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,318
done whatever they have to

1409
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,000
productive or whatever during the the

1410
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,880
day and they get to the evening they

1411
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,480
increase their dosage to decrease the

1412
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,160
the stress on their body and just make

1413
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,280
their body more inhabitable

1414
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:11,920
whereas in that example where you start

1415
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,119
slow and you increase the dosage

1416
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,039
throughout the day

1417
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,800
i've seen just as many patients go the

1418
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,838
opposite way where they wake up

1419
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,318
in a great amount of discomfort because

1420
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,880
uh for many of them it's it's from you

1421
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,079
know

1422
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,079
sleeping or or being horizontal and not

1423
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,000
sitting up or whatever and so they wake

1424
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,240
up in a great deal of discomfort

1425
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,079
and so they start the day heavily and

1426
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,838
then and then they slow down

1427
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,599
through the day and then and then they

1428
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,078
increase again at night so they

1429
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,519
they can increase their cannabinoid load

1430
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,480
before they go to sleep

1431
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,759
and it's that kind of variability which

1432
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,519
a lot of patients

1433
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,760
love about cannabis right because you

1434
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,400
just not really offered these options

1435
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,119
as a doctor in your situation where you

1436
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,079
can really

1437
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,079
go up and down and and give the patient

1438
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,160
so much control

1439
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,160
well that's fascinating shango that

1440
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,039
you've been able to see that kind of uh

1441
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:07,039
you know range of variable usage and

1442
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:10,400
effectiveness that's just so

1443
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:13,440
fantastic to hear so so

1444
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,639
when you are explaining uh

1445
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,400
uh um variability of dosage

1446
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,000
individualized medicine and that the

1447
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,639
patient's in control

1448
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,440
for for for most patients throughout

1449
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,879
their life

1450
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,559
their relationship's been with the

1451
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,440
doctors that the doctor tells you how

1452
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,440
much to take

1453
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,599
and you're not supposed to deviate from

1454
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,679
that but we all know that we all pretty

1455
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,039
much deviate from what the doctor tells

1456
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,679
us and then we

1457
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,159
often are not clean about that with our

1458
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:40,399
doctor

1459
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,199
because we because they're an authority

1460
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,559
figure

1461
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:44,639
how do you how do you go about

1462
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,880
explaining to a patient that

1463
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,318
they are in control of this medicine and

1464
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,960
they can take as much or as little as

1465
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:50,558
they want

1466
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,000
how do you kind of get them past the

1467
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,240
taboo that they

1468
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,358
are in control and that they don't have

1469
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,239
to do it the way

1470
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,199
um the way that they're being told yeah

1471
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,479
absolutely

1472
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:05,358
i mean that i think um a lot of

1473
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,199
what i've i'm coming from this

1474
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:12,078
integrative medicine background

1475
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:13,358
you know where um people are used to

1476
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,599
you know having a little bit more

1477
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:16,719
autonomy or a little more involvement in

1478
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,880
their health care

1479
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,078
um and so that that certain type of

1480
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,119
consumer or patient

1481
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,119
that that has already you know learned

1482
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,000
to listen to their body and then to

1483
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,760
to be more active in that pursuit and

1484
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,079
cannabis is a traditional

1485
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,880
plant medicine natural medicine and and

1486
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,359
that's

1487
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,960
you know people grew their own and and

1488
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,519
made their own products for

1489
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,880
thousands of years probably and um i

1490
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,559
think it's just um

1491
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,039
um you know just reminding people that

1492
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:47,200
this is not um kryptonite

1493
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,639
uh and that it's not gonna be like you

1494
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:49,118
take too much and then you're gonna go

1495
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,199
to the

1496
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,160
you know fatal overdose and you know

1497
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,358
something like that

1498
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,078
like might happen if you're um you know

1499
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,679
trying

1500
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:01,280
um some other more higher risk profile

1501
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,799
natural substances because there are

1502
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,880
definitely you know if you

1503
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,079
take too much datura or something like

1504
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,240
that you know you can have a really

1505
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,160
significant reaction or other types of

1506
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,598
plant medicines that have value but but

1507
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,480
also have a narrow window

1508
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,000
so it's emphasizing the safety um you

1509
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,760
know from the medical standpoint

1510
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,760
is really important and it's we we're

1511
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,880
fighting you know decades and decades

1512
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,599
of of political um and you know

1513
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,960
health political politicized public

1514
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:31,039
health messaging

1515
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:33,440
on the um you know uh extremely

1516
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:34,880
severe dangers of cannabis so that even

1517
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,079
one you know micro

1518
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,000
fragment is enough to you know um

1519
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,280
be so dangerous to society that somebody

1520
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,519
needs to be put away

1521
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,800
in jail and that that's just that that

1522
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,280
kind of reinforces the

1523
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,480
that fear and that cons that like let me

1524
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,119
be very very cautious

1525
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,039
the other thing i would say is that

1526
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,160
there's been a kind of a proliferation

1527
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,480
of para educators uh um

1528
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,358
para health professional educators um

1529
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,318
who who help

1530
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,679
patients um with with dosing uh with

1531
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,800
titration with kind of

1532
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,799
feedback and so it's it's having

1533
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,000
having somebody who you can kind of work

1534
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,880
with

1535
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
who can help kind of guide you in a more

1536
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,000
you know

1537
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,760
definitely you can still you're still in

1538
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,079
control but it's still nice to have

1539
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,079
a back and forth you know to to check

1540
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,079
yourself with to get other ideas

1541
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,000
other other suggestions of medicine or

1542
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,880
product and so i i've

1543
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,239
i've found valuable for patients um when

1544
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,680
i can refer them to

1545
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:35,519
um a company or an educator that's

1546
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:37,358
you know doing that work and coming from

1547
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,679
a patient advocacy standpoint where

1548
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,440
they're trying to empower with education

1549
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:43,199
so that's uh that's another way to kind

1550
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,720
of be in the in in between ground it's

1551
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:44,960
not just the doctor the patient it can

1552
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,078
be

1553
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,079
like a team of um with health educators

1554
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,280
i i like that we keep on coming back to

1555
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,880
this team approach

1556
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,319
uh because you know while this is

1557
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,400
becoming more and more popular

1558
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,000
historically it's not really how

1559
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,680
americans have interacted with the

1560
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,519
medical establishment and

1561
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,199
and i think that the the more examples

1562
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,199
you give uh the more

1563
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,838
apparent it is that this this level of

1564
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:10,960
care that hospice patients are getting

1565
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:12,558
is so much higher um that and it's so

1566
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,639
effective that it would really be great

1567
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,960
if if we all had that

1568
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,078
um so so let's talk about this last

1569
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,199
category of

1570
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,599
methods for using cannabis medicine and

1571
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:24,318
and that's suppositories and while you

1572
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,400
know while he

1573
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:27,519
always gets giggles when when i speak

1574
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,680
about it publicly

1575
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:35,280
um when push comes to shove

1576
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:37,919
it it can it can cause so much

1577
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,680
symptom relief that it brings patients

1578
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,200
to tears because

1579
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,719
they they've gone through all these

1580
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:44,799
different um

1581
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,799
pharmaceuticals and and they they didn't

1582
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,559
reach the needs that they wanted

1583
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,880
and so then everybody tells them they

1584
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,119
should try you know cannabis medicine

1585
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,358
and

1586
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,559
and generally you know suppositories are

1587
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:56,480
not the first things

1588
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,240
suggested by friends you know so they go

1589
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,519
through they go through smoking and

1590
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:00,879
maybe they'll go through capsules and

1591
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:02,480
maybe they'll go through tinctures and

1592
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,119
then they're finally like what the hell

1593
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,280
you know

1594
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,720
none of this stuff is working for me but

1595
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,760
it's supposed to work and it's working

1596
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:09,759
for other people

1597
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,000
but because of their particular health

1598
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,720
issues you know these other methods are

1599
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,838
not working

1600
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:19,039
and so you can take an oil

1601
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,440
and and make it into a suppository and

1602
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,480
then

1603
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,280
when you insert it rectally the the the

1604
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,039
capsule

1605
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,440
or the the the oil uh so some people use

1606
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:31,440
like a

1607
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,280
like a frozen um uh frozen oil

1608
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,720
uh i don't know pill i guess i'd

1609
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,920
consider it and

1610
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:40,399
and then that melts and the the uh the

1611
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,440
tissues on the walls of the rectum

1612
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,880
will absorb the oil and

1613
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,960
and the two biggest benefits that i find

1614
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,480
that are unique to it is number one it

1615
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,480
skips the stomach and

1616
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,599
and whatever kind of problems could be

1617
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,480
going on in the stomach

1618
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:59,440
but also um you can take a higher dosage

1619
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,440
of thc

1620
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,800
as a suppository than you can otherwise

1621
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,679
for

1622
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,318
pain relief so how do you see it

1623
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:08,399
actually

1624
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:10,079
play out first person and i guess

1625
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,160
suppositories are rare enough that you

1626
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,440
that you may not have uh seen much of

1627
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,199
this firsthand but

1628
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,880
but uh but perhaps you have so what are

1629
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:20,159
your thoughts

1630
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,440
well i think it's really i think you've

1631
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:24,558
pretty much said it all it's

1632
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,838
we don't have as much you know like

1633
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,200
pharmaco pharmacological data for a

1634
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:29,838
pharmacokinetic is what it's called

1635
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:31,838
where you know

1636
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:33,759
you look at absorption and you kind of

1637
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,279
calculate how much is in the bloodstream

1638
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,839
as a function of how much you put into

1639
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,480
the

1640
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,279
into the suppository that data isn't is

1641
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,318
there as much as

1642
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,559
we have with other routes of

1643
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,519
administration so it's there's a little

1644
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,359
bit more of um

1645
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:47,599
you know individualized or anecdotally

1646
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:48,318
driven um recommendation pattern which

1647
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,240
is fine

1648
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:52,400
i think it's um it's just we just need

1649
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:55,919
more learn to learn more i think

1650
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:58,400
you know um like for example i think you

1651
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,318
know the the absorbability of cbd might

1652
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,519
be higher than thc or

1653
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:05,759
actually i think the the thc we have

1654
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:08,079
better data on than cbd let me put it

1655
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,240
that way in terms of absorption from the

1656
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,359
even the ability to absorb from the um

1657
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:12,639
rectum

1658
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:14,719
so and then the other there are other

1659
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,318
issues with um

1660
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,000
um whether you're placing it in the

1661
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,159
right level

1662
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,358
in in the rectum because there's there's

1663
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,078
actually like um

1664
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,679
some the blood supply and there there's

1665
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,200
a there's there's a like a line of

1666
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,440
tissue that separates

1667
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:31,039
uh one one level of the rectum from

1668
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,440
another and there might be some some

1669
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:33,279
people

1670
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,358
might need even deeper insertion for

1671
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,119
better absorption but then

1672
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:38,558
you know you really want to make sure

1673
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,960
you don't have anything in there that's

1674
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,839
going to

1675
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,960
cause any any harm like it should really

1676
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,880
just be a dissolving

1677
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:50,880
um you know like bullet shaped type

1678
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,200
like oil oil object so the suppositories

1679
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,079
can be there's more of an art to it and

1680
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,199
um

1681
00:54:54,079 --> 00:55:00,798
and i i think um i i think

1682
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:03,039
you you it's sort of like uh smoking

1683
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,239
where you do bypass a lot of the liver

1684
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:06,239
effects

1685
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,679
at the first stage so that's kind of

1686
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,919
nice um

1687
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,078
and but you also get the longevity of

1688
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,798
effect of effect so that's also very

1689
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,200
okay can be very helpful so i think it's

1690
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:17,599
um

1691
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:20,000
i have a less experience i have patients

1692
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,519
that certainly use cannabis depositories

1693
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,280
and and they're very happy with the

1694
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:24,639
effect um i have we

1695
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,200
prescribe other medicines by its

1696
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,558
depository so it's not not a new

1697
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,879
method to me it's just that we don't

1698
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,280
have as much data on it with cannabis

1699
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,039
it's really interesting helping patients

1700
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,400
and their families

1701
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,838
you know once they've decided that

1702
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,798
suppositories are going to be their

1703
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:40,639
solution

1704
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:42,318
um it's amazing how much i've learned

1705
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,719
about suppositories

1706
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:46,480
just from trying to help uh families

1707
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:48,719
figure out how to do it right you know

1708
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,559
they're they're suppository kits online

1709
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,480
on ebay that you can pick up and

1710
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,160
it's really funny they look like um you

1711
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,719
know they just they look like ice

1712
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:57,759
make ice trays right and and people are

1713
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,959
putting you know a little

1714
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,119
a little squirt of cannabis oil from a

1715
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,199
syringe and a little bit of shea butter

1716
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,680
and a little bit of coconut oil in there

1717
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:07,039
and then

1718
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,039
tossing them in the freezer which is

1719
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:12,159
like a really really basic

1720
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:13,920
um recipe and um

1721
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:15,279
and you know they get harder and then

1722
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,760
once they take them out you know they've

1723
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,400
got a few moments to um

1724
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,119
introduce it to the body before it warms

1725
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,079
up and gets

1726
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,000
uh soft and of course that's always an

1727
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,920
interesting experience for the patient

1728
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,599
um to have something so chilly down

1729
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,838
there but

1730
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,160
but um it's interesting like i find that

1731
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:37,440
more and more people are realizing that

1732
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:39,118
a lot of um just regular old capsules

1733
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,079
like you'd buy at the pharmacy just like

1734
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,119
empty

1735
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:47,119
you know number three capsules um

1736
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,760
they as well will uh disintegrate in the

1737
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,519
rectum

1738
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,440
and it really doesn't have to you don't

1739
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:54,159
really necessarily have to go down

1740
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,240
this path of you know building your own

1741
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:59,279
reinventing suppositories

1742
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:01,439
um right but but you know it's a

1743
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,599
it's a whole rabbit hole of its own you

1744
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,880
know

1745
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,880
yeah i i think it's um we need more data

1746
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,559
um but i think i'm really happy to hear

1747
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,358
that patients are making their own

1748
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,160
products and

1749
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:15,039
exploring it and um i think a lot of

1750
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:16,639
folks are also

1751
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,719
interested in this for disease

1752
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:20,639
modification you know to get the night

1753
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,159
higher number of milligrams to see if

1754
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:25,199
that will help to

1755
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:25,759
change the course of their cancer and i

1756
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:27,759
just

1757
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,359
i think it's harder we need more

1758
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,720
information to find out exactly how much

1759
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,719
is coming out of there

1760
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,558
uh into the bloodstream so that we can

1761
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,000
um you know help guide better

1762
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,839
and i think there's gonna be we're gonna

1763
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,519
find it's not it doesn't not everything

1764
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,078
absorbs the same way

1765
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:43,519
that um and that that you get in the you

1766
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,960
know small intestine

1767
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:50,000
so it's um it's going to be um

1768
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:53,119
uh i don't know um hopefully somebody is

1769
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,960
going to do that those studies

1770
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,160
so so what what advice do you have for

1771
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,039
folks who are going to use

1772
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:00,239
different methods together so say

1773
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:04,318
they're going to use

1774
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:05,039
capsules and smoking or vaporizing and a

1775
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:06,960
tincture

1776
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,239
or or you know one of the others in

1777
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,440
suppositories

1778
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:13,199
um uh because you know in

1779
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,119
taking these different ways you you have

1780
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:16,558
issues with you know timing of when it

1781
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,960
hits your body and also

1782
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,680
having to do the math of your your

1783
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,880
dosage

1784
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,440
you've got a you know a lot of

1785
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,559
experience with you know a variety of

1786
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,200
medicines and stacking them right so so

1787
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,760
so how do you teach that to patients

1788
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,318
yeah it's

1789
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,280
it's pretty much like a uh you want to

1790
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:34,719
have

1791
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,400
what we're talking with end of life

1792
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,159
patients so a lot of there's a lot often

1793
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,760
times a lot of symptom burden that's

1794
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:41,199
just going to be there throughout the

1795
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,119
day so

1796
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:46,078
so it's useful to have a kind of a

1797
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:49,119
workhorse you know something that's

1798
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,880
giving you a steady state or more

1799
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,480
you know long-acting effect and that's

1800
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,599
like we talked about you know

1801
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,358
tinctures or capsules um and

1802
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,720
and then you can think of other methods

1803
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:01,838
uh vaping

1804
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,039
uh and even suppositories it's kind of a

1805
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,880
shorter acting

1806
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,159
like breakthrough or you know it's a

1807
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,599
thing something that you can layer

1808
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:12,159
on top of that longer acting workhorse

1809
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,240
so i'd like to think of it that way to

1810
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:15,358
help patients understand that there's

1811
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:17,358
something you're going to kind of need

1812
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:18,000
at the bait at the basal level and then

1813
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:19,519
what else

1814
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,039
do you need when when you need something

1815
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:22,639
beyond that and that's

1816
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,239
that that that's that's sort of a good

1817
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:25,920
way to think about it yeah that's

1818
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:27,279
that's a really good idea have have the

1819
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,240
one be your central

1820
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,240
solution and then have have these these

1821
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:35,118
extras that you might add as

1822
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:36,078
as needed um do you normally recommend

1823
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:40,000
that patients

1824
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:41,760
uh keep some sort of dosing journal too

1825
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,519
yes that's very helpful especially when

1826
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,359
you're trying to figure things out and

1827
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,119
seeing what's working not working

1828
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:50,159
and of course with the you know this is

1829
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,920
a complex botanical medicine with

1830
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:53,838
uh it's not just one active ingredient

1831
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,838
so the more you also know about

1832
00:59:53,838 --> 01:00:00,400
you know what what percentage or

1833
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:01,519
consistency or potency material you're

1834
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,559
putting in your body

1835
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:07,679
so by making note of that quantity

1836
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,519
and time of day um will

1837
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,039
you know and and if you have you know

1838
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:12,639
you can put on the other on the columns

1839
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:13,119
okay these are the symptoms i'm treating

1840
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:14,719
and

1841
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,559
and this is what it was before and this

1842
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,879
is what it was after in terms of um

1843
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,760
you know severity on a 1 to 10 scale for

1844
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,559
example

1845
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,319
so that that kind of data can be really

1846
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,960
you can look at do that over like five

1847
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:27,358
days and

1848
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,159
get a lot of information and show that

1849
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:30,558
to your

1850
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:31,598
you know to whoever's helping you um

1851
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,319
with with dosing

1852
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,039
and and and you know because it can

1853
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:37,279
become comp

1854
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,239
it can become a lot but this is just

1855
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,319
really to help

1856
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:41,759
you know make sense of everything and

1857
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:42,400
there's just so many products is the

1858
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,720
problem too

1859
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,440
so people kind of get overwhelmed and

1860
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:47,439
and that's where

1861
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,358
um you know starting with at least like

1862
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,039
one you know that's one and then

1863
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,798
and then another layer on top of it and

1864
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:56,000
then keeping keeping notes

1865
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,759
will help to um simplify

1866
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,440
this and you know this is just just the

1867
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,760
idea just to sort of dial us in so that

1868
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,400
then

1869
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,599
you know you can you know move on with

1870
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,039
your life you know and

1871
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,720
and do the things that you want to do

1872
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:07,519
and yeah the other thing i didn't

1873
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:09,519
mention in the

1874
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:11,199
in the previous section about the

1875
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:14,559
details on cannabis is

1876
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:17,919
in end of life care you know

1877
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,480
there may not be like a set dosing

1878
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,240
pattern

1879
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,920
just it might be like you know

1880
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:25,598
people just are finding something that

1881
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,400
helps them with their mood

1882
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,599
and you know they they they just they

1883
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,160
use that or they

1884
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,680
they use it when they like to because um

1885
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:34,879
you know their mood varies throughout

1886
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:36,719
the day or their their

1887
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,720
level of interaction with people changes

1888
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:39,759
or they get they get fatigued after a

1889
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:42,639
certain amount of time

1890
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,599
or they use it for energy so sometimes

1891
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:45,279
it can just be

1892
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,640
a really like okay let me just have

1893
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,720
these on hand

1894
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:50,239
and i kind of know what they all do and

1895
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:53,358
what they're all good for

1896
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:55,759
and so let me just sort of mix and match

1897
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:57,279
you know so that that's also another

1898
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,480
like i don't want to like make it so

1899
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,839
complicated and like

1900
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,760
a program you know it should be a chance

1901
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:06,239
to also have a spontaneous

1902
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,680
um kind of empowerment toolkit yeah

1903
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:09,759
excellent i like that an empowerment

1904
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:12,719
toolkit yeah i like that

1905
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,200
so um you know it's not uncommon to hear

1906
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:15,279
from

1907
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,639
a patient you know three months into

1908
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,720
this process

1909
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,480
that uh the cannabis just isn't working

1910
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,719
like it used to anymore

1911
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,318
and um and you know it's one of the

1912
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,358
challenges with cannabis medicine that

1913
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,400
over time

1914
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:30,798
the human body can develop tolerance um

1915
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,559
would you explain a little bit about uh

1916
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:35,038
tolerance to cannabis and

1917
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,760
and how you what kind of advice you give

1918
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,200
your

1919
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:42,079
um patients about uh manipulating their

1920
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:45,519
doses or taking tolerance breaks

1921
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:46,240
absolutely i mean i i've got my

1922
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:49,679
colleague

1923
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:51,598
dr dustin sulak in maine uh an amazing

1924
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:54,159
osteopathic physician and cannabis

1925
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:57,440
researcher and scholar

1926
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:59,440
he has made such a nice um like websites

1927
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,440
and patient literature and videos

1928
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:05,679
about his um re-sensitization protocols

1929
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,159
i just always refer my patients so

1930
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:10,639
please go listen to dr schulack's

1931
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,399
lectures or videos about this he has a

1932
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:14,798
website healer.com

1933
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,798
and so i i just have him do the

1934
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:18,639
explanation but i mean

1935
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:21,119
what he explained to people basically in

1936
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:24,078
a bottom line is that that you know your

1937
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,519
cb1 receptors even cb2 but all any

1938
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,720
receptor which is the

1939
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:30,559
um protein on the cells that um on the

1940
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:31,679
surface of the cells like up nerve cells

1941
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,000
for example that

1942
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:35,679
um cannabis cannabinoids from cannabis

1943
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,679
um you know bind to

1944
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,960
and signal through to cause the

1945
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:41,519
downstream effect of

1946
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,240
modulating excitability whether it's

1947
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:44,079
like um

1948
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:45,358
you know overactive pain circuits

1949
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:48,400
overactive

1950
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:49,598
vomiting circuit or you know um boosting

1951
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,318
up the activity of um

1952
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,720
of a neurons that are involved in mood

1953
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:54,798
or

1954
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:56,078
or slowing down the activity of neurons

1955
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:58,239
that are involved in

1956
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,200
negative thoughts all that kind of

1957
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:00,879
modulation that

1958
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:02,159
is through those receptors you know

1959
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,200
through tickling or binding to those

1960
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:05,199
receptors

1961
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,838
and you know if you just keep pushing

1962
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:09,759
and pushing and pushing cannabinoids

1963
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:12,719
um for a long period of time those

1964
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,640
receptors can get desensitized

1965
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:15,838
and that means that they just they don't

1966
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:19,279
make as many of them

1967
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:20,159
or um you know it's usually that like

1968
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,839
they just kind of

1969
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,199
come back into them into the cell

1970
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:26,558
membrane rather than being

1971
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:29,598
out there ready to receive signals so

1972
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,798
it's a dynamic system so if you kind of

1973
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:34,000
take a break from the

1974
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:35,280
cannabinoid exposure or the holidays

1975
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,760
all the different protocols that dr

1976
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,359
schulack has advised you can really just

1977
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,039
re-sensitize the whole system it can

1978
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,038
kind of reboot nicely

1979
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,039
so that's that's the that's the solution

1980
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,119
there i mean and on the extreme

1981
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,480
sometimes you take too much not only is

1982
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,440
it not working it can actually make

1983
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,639
things worse

1984
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,119
there's there's something called the

1985
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:55,118
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

1986
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,960
which is more rare but it does happen i

1987
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,200
do see it in my practice and

1988
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,960
i we we think that there's a you know

1989
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:03,118
the body's like having an over

1990
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,240
overactive immune response to all these

1991
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,000
cannabinoids and

1992
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:08,639
ends up making an antibody this is one

1993
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,960
theory that kind of um might be blocking

1994
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:11,279
the

1995
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,960
um the receptors and and end up ending

1996
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,079
up giving you more nausea and vomiting

1997
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,559
rather than less

1998
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:18,160
so that that's kind of the um everything

1999
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,720
is in moderation so

2000
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:22,480
so that's where i if uh if cannabis

2001
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:22,879
isn't working as well it's also possible

2002
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,159
that

2003
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:29,599
um you know other therapies might be

2004
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,558
helpful you know um cannabis is not a

2005
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,000
complete medicine

2006
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,920
it's certainly a holistic medicine it

2007
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,880
can do a lot of things but there are

2008
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,400
also other

2009
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,240
other natural medicines out there and

2010
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:42,160
other strategies um

2011
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:43,358
that you know can can synergize with

2012
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:45,279
cannabinoids so

2013
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:47,358
that's the other thing i would say about

2014
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,480
that so let's take that and go the other

2015
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:51,519
direction with it

2016
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,920
what kind of um interaction with

2017
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:54,639
other drugs have you seen in your

2018
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,200
practice

2019
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:58,480
between um you know the pharmaceuticals

2020
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:03,038
that there may be

2021
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:06,079
and and um and then using cannabis

2022
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,839
well the most common one that i see in

2023
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,079
my type of practice

2024
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,358
um is the combination of cannabinoids

2025
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,400
and opioids

2026
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:15,759
um and this is opioids from are derived

2027
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:20,000
from opium poppy

2028
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:22,720
like morphine a codeine

2029
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,159
and and then derivatives from the bain

2030
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:24,480
which is another ingredient anyway

2031
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:26,879
that's

2032
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,079
there's a whole class of opioids maybe

2033
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,480
people heard about hydro

2034
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,240
hydrocodone hydromorphone uh you know

2035
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,798
dilaudid fentanyl the

2036
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:35,358
the long list those medicines can be

2037
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:36,960
helpful

2038
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,480
for pain but if they're the only ones

2039
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,960
you rely on they have

2040
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,159
also significant problems with tolerance

2041
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,119
um with um

2042
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:46,879
dependency with the constipation um with

2043
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,000
suppression of adrenal access with

2044
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,400
long-term use

2045
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,239
so if there's any way that you can make

2046
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,119
the dosing of those

2047
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:56,959
more effective like you know that you

2048
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,920
take cannabinoids and layer that with

2049
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,000
opioids

2050
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,680
and the pain relief is synergistic or

2051
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,280
greater or last longer

2052
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:05,679
that's kind of the one of the drug

2053
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,280
interactions that is very positive and

2054
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:08,798
actually has been studied in clinical

2055
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,559
trials and we know it's a real

2056
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:12,159
phenomenon and it actually probably

2057
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,680
makes opioids safer

2058
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:15,358
because the blood level of the opioids

2059
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,399
also comes down which

2060
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:20,639
lowers the chance for having an overdose

2061
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,240
so that's that's kind of a big one that

2062
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:24,400
i i see a lot there's

2063
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,399
there's many there's long tables of drug

2064
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,920
interactions and

2065
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,680
cannabinoids one of the ones that was

2066
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,358
really pointed out with the introduction

2067
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:34,798
of high dose cbd on the market

2068
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:37,119
epidiolex that's the tincture of um

2069
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:37,920
cannabis that is used in in seizure

2070
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,440
disorders

2071
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,838
uh fda approved for that um

2072
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,440
they go on pretty high doses or they can

2073
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:46,960
go on pretty high doses of

2074
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,798
cbd like hundreds and hundreds of

2075
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,159
milligrams per day

2076
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:55,358
and at that level um it can impact your

2077
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:57,519
ability to metabolize um other

2078
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:58,719
anti-seizure medicines that your doctor

2079
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:00,559
might have prescribed one of them is

2080
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:02,558
called clobazam it's as well known or

2081
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:05,680
our trade name is anfi

2082
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:07,599
and if you take a lot of cbd um with on

2083
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:10,318
fee the on sea levels become

2084
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,359
more toxic in the body and so they have

2085
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:14,400
to be monitored

2086
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:15,759
more closely uh and that's that's been

2087
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,279
shown in these studies and

2088
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,880
you know that that does come up from

2089
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,319
time to time i have patients who

2090
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,079
who have seizure disorders who come to

2091
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,400
see me for advice and they're they're

2092
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,000
taking on feed so we always monitor the

2093
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,079
blood levels of on fee while we're

2094
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,759
titrating up cannabinoids

2095
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:31,838
um so that you know we know that we're

2096
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:34,000
in a safe range so that

2097
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:35,039
it's it's kind of like on on one hand i

2098
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,439
can count the sort of

2099
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:39,359
some of the major issues in general

2100
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:43,039
cannabinoids play well with others

2101
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:46,560
from most medicines so um i think

2102
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:48,719
it's it's just a matter of um

2103
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,159
what can what can you mix it with

2104
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,759
therapeutically i think there's a lot

2105
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:53,599
more to talk about in terms of

2106
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:56,000
what can you mix it with or what can it

2107
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,520
help to reduce the amount of reliance on

2108
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,279
i'm not a purist i think

2109
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,880
it's nice to use other medicines if you

2110
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,960
need them but maybe cannabis will help

2111
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,199
to reduce the dose of those medicines

2112
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,239
excellent fantastic well oh were you

2113
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:08,798
done

2114
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:09,358
yeah all right fantastic so um during

2115
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:11,439
the set

2116
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,480
third set we're going to talk about

2117
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,559
trying to

2118
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,399
use cannabis medicine in real life so

2119
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,159
far we've talked a lot about

2120
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,399
you know the theoreticals and the ideal

2121
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:22,000
situation but after the set or after the

2122
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:24,158
break we're gonna talk about

2123
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,158
um you know resistance by the family and

2124
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:27,838
resistance by the care facility which

2125
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:30,399
which is its own thing to tackle

2126

01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:56,079
talked a lot so far about you know

01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:58,239
the why and the how of cannabis medicine

2324
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:59,359
in kind of like an idealized environment

2325

but we both

2326
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:04,238
know that um when it gets down to the

2327
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:07,119
moment of helping a patient

2328
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:08,639
there are challenges and and hoops that

2329
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:12,479
we have to jump through

2330
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:14,960
to to make it work so um number one

2331
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:17,119
on that list is usually resistance by

2332
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:20,560
the family right because we've had

2333

um you know what 70 plus years

2334

of of um federal resistance to cannabis

2335
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:28,559
medicine

2336
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:29,840
and and it's and it's taboo and a lot of

2337
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,880
people do not feel

2338
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,840
comfortable having their parent or loved

2339
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,640
one

2340
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,039
using cannabis which they are unfamiliar

2341
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,119
with

2342
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:44,079
and may have have some you know societal

2343
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:45,599
beliefs against i i figure you probably

2344
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:47,279
run into that all the time because you

2345
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,120
have such an integrative approach you

2346
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:49,599
use a lot of stuff that people don't

2347
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:53,119
even

2348
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:56,560
know what it is and um so so how do you

2349
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,599
normally uh approach a family do you do

2350
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,520
you normally

2351
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,600
um i guess this probably has a lot to do

2352
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,880
with the the state of the patient but

2353
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,400
i'm just going to kind of set it up for

2354
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:06,159
you do you normally talk to the patient

2355
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:08,719
first or the family first

2356
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:11,279
when you know that cannabis is going to

2357
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:13,279
be a helpful thing if used properly

2358
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:15,439
how do you go about introducing it and

2359
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:17,599
working with a family that that may be

2360
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:20,719
resistant

2361
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:23,760
now it's um the the first thing i

2362
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:27,279
always try to do is to name

2363
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:30,560
the what it is um

2364
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:32,079
what the barrier is in this case and and

2365
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,640
you know putting a name on it makes it a

2366
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:37,279
little bit more um

2367
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,880
you know like a tangible understandable

2368
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:42,399
um contextualizes it

2369
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:45,440
into the larger um social

2370
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:47,839
fabric of of of a patient

2371
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:48,639
and family's life um you know other

2372
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,840
issues

2373
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:55,440
in society uh where we face

2374
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:58,319
discrimination based on you know age

2375
01:17:55,439 --> 01:18:00,000
gender race religion all the different

2376
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:02,799
things that unfortunately we still

2377
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,079
are are living with and and are trying

2378
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,600
to systematically

2379
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:10,719
address so and that that term is stigma

2380
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:14,159
the the the issue of stigma which

2381
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:17,198
is tied to shame and fear

2382
01:18:14,158 --> 01:18:19,039
and um ostracization that's that's what

2383
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:20,158
you know stigma comes from this idea of

2384
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:22,880
being marked

2385
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:23,839
a stigmata a mark that that kind of

2386
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,719
makes you

2387
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,920
uh you know ostracized or socially

2388
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,760
outcast

2389
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,960
and so there's there's a stigma of

2390
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,480
cannabis that

2391
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,319
persists and that was you know

2392
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,799
engineered um or

2393
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:37,840
pushed pushed by the uh the government

2394
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,400
for a long time

2395
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,960
not that there wasn't um there's always

2396
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:43,839
been

2397
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:45,840
kind of in puritanical settings some

2398
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,159
concern about substances that

2399
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,199
change your ordinary state of mind and

2400
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:51,439
so i think people

2401
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:54,238
just need to understand that that's can

2402
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:57,599
be done safely and appropriately and in

2403
01:18:54,238 --> 01:19:00,799
any accepted context that's safe

2404
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,880
and healing and so i after you

2405
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,400
talk about you say this is stigma that

2406
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,960
you're facing and if a patient tells me

2407
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:06,319
that they're

2408
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,319
you know they'd love to try this but

2409
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:11,679
their their loved one is really

2410
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:13,519
like doesn't see it that way um or you

2411
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,239
know they'll they'll put limits i've had

2412
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,080
some

2413
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:17,279
loved ones patients tell me oh well you

2414
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:20,399
know my uh

2415
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:21,119
my uh siblings older siblings somebody

2416
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:23,439
who has a long

2417
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:24,880
lifelong disability she has siblings

2418
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:25,839
that's looked after else looked after

2419
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,079
her but

2420
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,760
one of the siblings is really in favor

2421
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,000
of cannabis the other ones are not

2422
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,440
and so they kind of like don't go as far

2423
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,800
as they could go in terms of what could

2424
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:37,359
help the patient

2425
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,279
so things like that i i come across and

2426
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,359
i always tell family i tell patients

2427
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:43,279
listen i'm happy to have a

2428
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:44,479
family meeting you know a conversation

2429
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:47,119
with your family members

2430
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,559
um to help them address their concerns

2431
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:49,119
or questions that they have about this

2432
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,800
it's

2433
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,079
you know it's just it's it's stigma and

2434
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,960
it's something that we should talk about

2435
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:56,399
it's usually

2436
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:58,079
grounded in some um ignorance uh or you

2437
01:19:56,399 --> 01:19:59,839
know lack of knowledge and then there

2438
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:02,000
there is there's fear too

2439
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,079
and the that's sort of the other angle

2440
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,158
is that sometimes the fear is

2441
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:08,158
sort of warranted you know in terms of

2442
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:10,638
like actual

2443
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:12,399
legal repercussions that can befall a

2444
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,560
family or a patient that they're

2445
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:15,519
concerned about and you know that's

2446
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,719
where

2447
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,719
you know and that's what the other

2448
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:21,119
context around well what is

2449
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,399
exactly the what are the legal issues

2450
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,039
here what are the

2451
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:26,559
you know what are the you know who's

2452
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:28,238
making the rules and who's enforcing

2453
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,159
those rules and

2454
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,079
is there any way we can find medical

2455
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:35,839
exemptions or exceptions or

2456
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:37,039
you know utilizing that angle of of um

2457
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,119
of medical care where you have to

2458
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:40,560
advocate for a patient's rights or their

2459
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:43,039
patients needs

2460
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,920
um you know and if the laws and rules

2461
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:47,198
are

2462
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:49,359
impinging on on medicine then um

2463
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:51,039
then you know what what can who which

2464
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,479
social worker do we need to call which

2465
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:54,960
lawyer do we need to call

2466
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:56,238
who do we need to write a letter to um

2467
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,679
you know how how can we

2468
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:01,439
um you know

2469
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,719
overcome that barrier so that that's

2470
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,039
sort of how i

2471
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,960
um family conversation identifying

2472
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:09,760
stigma talking with the family

2473
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,319
um inviting you know educating and then

2474
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,079
um

2475
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:14,158
you know if there are real barriers like

2476
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:14,880
a legal or administrative barriers

2477
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:16,799
trying to

2478
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,079
address those with with them with the

2479
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,279
team approach and

2480
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:21,840
and medical and letters if needed it is

2481
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:24,079
interesting

2482
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,039
how you know even though the family is

2483
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:28,719
coming to you

2484
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:32,800
for expert advice how often they will

2485
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:33,600
then try to um create the ground rules

2486
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,400
for with

2487
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,880
for within which you work so for example

2488
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:38,559
um

2489
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,920
you know it's it's not uncommon for a

2490
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,000
family to say yeah we're okay with

2491
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,399
cannabis medicine but only cbd and not

2492
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,960
thc but they don't really understand

2493
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:49,759
that thc even at low

2494
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,880
uh doses that don't cause euphoria are

2495
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,639
still

2496
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,159
you know thc is generally going to be

2497
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,000
part of a healing process when it comes

2498
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:58,319
to cannabis medicine

2499
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,079
yeah that's right that's those those

2500
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:03,279
kind of the the cbd only

2501
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:05,439
um like is a thc stigma is

2502
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:07,679
is even more specific you know and and

2503
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:10,719
and that's also requires

2504
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:12,960
um the same approach uh

2505
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:14,000
when you when you need to interact with

2506
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,719
a family

2507
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and and and they say yeah let's do a

2508
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:21,679
family meeting

2509
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,279
um uh it is

2510
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,440
it's hard right because you've got all

2511
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:26,960
these different uh communication styles

2512
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,960
of all these different people

2513
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,639
and you might you know the patient

2514
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,960
probably knows you decently

2515
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:34,000
and and maybe the the spouse or maybe

2516
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:38,079
the one

2517
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,840
the one uh child who is kind of running

2518
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:41,198
point for the family knows you pretty

2519
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,159
well but then you've got all these new

2520
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:43,839
people

2521
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:45,839
in the room or on the zoom call or

2522
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,199
whatever and they don't know you and

2523
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,920
like you're like oh my gosh

2524
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:50,638
how am i gonna communicate to this room

2525
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,319
where

2526
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:54,400
i've got all these varying people how do

2527
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:57,679
you how do you deal with that

2528
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:59,198
yeah well um these are these are

2529
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,960
things that they teach us a little bit

2530
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:02,799
about in in um in

2531
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,158
hospice and palliative medicine training

2532
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,880
fellowship training

2533
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:08,879
and it's it's really just the the the

2534
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,199
research shows that the more that

2535
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,199
family members speak in meetings have an

2536
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:13,519
opportunity to to actually be heard and

2537
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:16,879
to

2538
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:20,080
to to speak rather than being spoken to

2539
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,840
um um improves their um

2540
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:24,000
their satisfaction with the experience

2541
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:27,360
you know so it's it's really more

2542
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,760
about creating a venue a space

2543
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:30,799
a platform for family members to listen

2544
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,880
to each other

2545
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,880
um and and to be heard about their

2546
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,840
concerns so you know asking open-ended

2547
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,719
questions

2548
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,480
and um you know certainly leading the

2549
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,359
meeting but giving a lot of space for

2550
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:44,479
people to

2551
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:45,759
kind of state their concerns and

2552
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:48,319
and you know and then if there are

2553
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,880
emotional aspects um in

2554
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:51,840
in that in their concerns uh oftentimes

2555
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,639
there are

2556
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,000
um very strong emotional issues fear

2557
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:59,520
like i was mentioning or

2558
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,279
um you know the shame or um

2559
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,280
the tied to stigma or whatever it might

2560
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:05,439
be then you know naming those

2561
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:06,960
naming those emotions like i can unders

2562
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:08,238
i can hear your frustration i can hear

2563
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:11,439
that you're worried

2564
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:14,238
um and and that that helps to

2565
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:15,759
improve the the communication name name

2566
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:17,119
the concerns and you know start to

2567
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,039
hopefully move towards

2568
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:20,719
uh you know if if this is actually

2569
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:22,560
something a patient needs and then being

2570
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,279
the advocate for the patient as a doctor

2571
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,760
and you know giving me advice that's

2572
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:27,279
right

2573
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,199
my recommendation and then you know

2574
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:31,599
seeing what people say so that's

2575
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:32,479
that's how that's how to approach those

2576
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,600
it's

2577
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:38,559
it's there's an art to that

2578
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,239
i i would think that uh clinical doctors

2579
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:43,600
that is one of the key

2580
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:46,238
tools in their tool box is communication

2581
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,840
skills because certainly uh somebody

2582
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:48,959
who's interacting with family all the

2583
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,560
time is going to

2584
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,079
need a different version of

2585
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:55,199
communication skills

2586
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:56,960
than a uh you know a research doctor

2587
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:58,559
right who who still needs to know how to

2588
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,119
interact with people but it's a lot

2589
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,280
different

2590
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:05,760
dealing with the folks in a lab versus

2591
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:06,559
family members who are dealing with a

2592
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:10,000
end of

2593
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,520
life patient

2594
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,198
because they've got all their own

2595
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,000
emotions are all on

2596
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:16,799
like hyper then because they're they're

2597
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,119
freaked out

2598
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,440
and and and they're trying to review

2599
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:23,198
their life's history with this person

2600
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:25,759
and they're they're they got their own

2601
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:27,359
taboos oh my gosh what a what a soup of

2602
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,600
a mess

2603
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:30,559
yeah you got it and and that's that is

2604
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,120
our um

2605
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,920
in my field um hospice and palliative

2606
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:36,880
care

2607
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,639
um communication is really one of the

2608
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,000
critical skill sets that we

2609
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:44,800
work on because it's very important to

2610
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,158
um you know to deal with to to even

2611
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,840
figure out what's going on with the

2612
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:50,559
patient how you can better help their

2613
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,199
their distress levels or or the family

2614
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,760
or

2615
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:54,879
sometimes i'm involved in helping them

2616
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,719
um

2617
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,400
you know develop the care goals like

2618
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,960
whether they should go this way

2619
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:02,719
take that treatment take this treatment

2620
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,960
you know or focus more on

2621
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:06,960
a fully palliative approach like trying

2622
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:10,480
to sort that out

2623
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:14,000
requires a lot of um ability to um

2624
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:15,919
understand the various um competing um

2625
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,119
you know interests that are involved in

2626
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,600
trying to center the

2627
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:21,439
what the patient's values are so it's it

2628
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,760
is a um

2629
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:25,359
it's is you know in general i would say

2630
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,880
um when it comes to cannabis

2631
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:28,479
discussions and talking about this

2632
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,800
stigma if people

2633
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:32,079
are are ready to sit down and talk about

2634
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,159
it um or

2635
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:35,119
we've already made huge progress i

2636
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:37,119
remember

2637
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:39,039
when um you know the state of washington

2638
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:39,760
had no legal access to cannabis you know

2639
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:41,519
until this

2640
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,360
law passed i mean they had medical

2641
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,719
marijuana but they didn't have uh adult

2642
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:46,960
use and

2643
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:48,399
you know the big campaign uh that the

2644
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,198
aclu ran was

2645
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:52,799
marijuana it's time for a conversation

2646
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:55,119
you know and it was this this whole idea

2647
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:57,679
hey we can sit down and talk about this

2648
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:58,158
yeah you know we can sort of change some

2649
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,399
of our

2650
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:02,719
um preconceived notions and that that

2651
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:04,238
was kind of a brilliant stroke and i

2652
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,158
think the same thing is true in

2653
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:07,359
in the individual context with the

2654
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:09,279
family

2655
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:10,479
it is often frustrating because even

2656
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:12,719
when you have a

2657
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:14,319
family that is totally into it and

2658
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:15,359
they're you know they're modern they're

2659
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:16,639
open-minded

2660
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:18,719
and they're actually thinking about

2661
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,800
what's best for the patient

2662
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:22,079
then you've got resistance from the care

2663
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,800
facility because

2664
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:25,600
generally they accept federal money and

2665
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,079
therefore

2666
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,719
are beholden to federal laws i can

2667
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:32,719
imagine

2668
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:35,359
that as a you know integrative caregiver

2669
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:36,480
um that running up against that barrier

2670
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:40,079
causes you

2671
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:42,879
unending amounts of frustration

2672
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:44,559
oh well yeah i mean again as i mentioned

2673
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,039
earlier in our podcast

2674
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,480
i have seen i've seen a nice amount of

2675
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:50,399
change

2676
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:52,319
in the in the greater you know

2677
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:55,039
healthcare environment um

2678
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:57,279
residential care facility environment um

2679
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:58,800
in the 20 years that

2680
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:00,960
or so that i've been thinking about this

2681
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,920
topic and and being in clinical settings

2682
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,119
i would say

2683
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:07,920
so i think um so and

2684
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:08,880
and and so to to add to that like i've

2685
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,079
had um

2686
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:16,239
examples of where i've had um like

2687
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:18,319
privately owned chains of um

2688
01:28:16,238 --> 01:28:19,919
assisted living or end of life

2689
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:20,719
residential care facilities which have a

2690
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,199
lot of older

2691
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:24,239
population like um one one i'll just

2692
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:26,479
name this

2693
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:27,759
aegis living aegis he's just living

2694
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,959
there they're a huge

2695
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:34,000
they're in multiple states um they

2696
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:37,198
um like i would say five years ago

2697
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:40,238
or uh something like that worked out

2698
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:43,359
a policy for um you know

2699
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:46,718
allowing cannabis in their facility

2700
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:48,399
uh and having having um uh

2701
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,920
i've seen other facilities that are

2702
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,198
privately owned also that allow their

2703
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,158
nurses to handle

2704
01:28:51,198 --> 01:28:54,479
cannabis that patients bring in um you

2705
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:56,079
know

2706
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:57,919
their care staff if they're if they're

2707
01:28:56,079 --> 01:29:02,000
helped getting help with medicines

2708
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:03,920
and so so i've kind of interacted with

2709
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,679
clusters of facilities that

2710
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,199
chose to not be beholden to some of the

2711
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:08,079
federal rules even though their patients

2712
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:10,158
might be on

2713
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:11,439
you know medicare or receiving some

2714
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:13,679
federal benefits

2715
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:15,359
it's probably because they're you know

2716
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:18,158
independent

2717
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:19,759
um or largely independent um but you

2718
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:21,679
know there's always still some overlap

2719
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,280
there's always some federal regulations

2720
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,679
state regulations

2721
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:26,719
involved in all of these facilities you

2722
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:28,880
know and so it's

2723
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,399
it's just a matter of like well is it

2724
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,639
enough to make a difference or are we

2725
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:35,359
just using that as an excuse

2726
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,159
you know um to to just sort of pump the

2727
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:38,000
issue

2728
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:39,759
so i've been i've been very heartened by

2729
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,520
the fact that some of these facilities

2730
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,239
develop their own internal policies in

2731
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,080
general

2732
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:46,079
they'll say no to smoking cannabis

2733
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:47,359
they'll say you know non-smoked products

2734
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:50,319
they'll say that the patient needs to

2735
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:52,399
have a medical cannabis authorization

2736
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:53,599
um and that things need to be labeled

2737
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,158
and this and that so

2738
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,440
um you know sometimes security around

2739
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:00,479
the product so

2740
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:03,759
um like i mean like a secure secure um

2741
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:05,759
storage so that that's where i i think

2742
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,119
i've seen some changes now

2743
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,719
and then the other place that i

2744
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:09,599
struggled a lot on this with was the

2745
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:11,679
hospital

2746
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,360
you know the hospital is really like the

2747
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,639
the center of you know advanced

2748
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:17,839
high-tech medical care

2749
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:20,239
and lots of regulations on hospitals

2750
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,800
um and you know many times patients

2751
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:25,359
would sneak things in and just sort of

2752
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,520
you know the hospital didn't want the

2753
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:29,198
liability of saying okay well

2754
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,040
you had a something happen to you and

2755
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:32,238
it's a medicine that we did not give you

2756
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:34,319
or authorized so

2757
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:35,439
we we just don't want you on it and so

2758
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:38,960
that kind of like

2759
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:41,439
legal impasse prevented a lot of um

2760
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,960
you know uh acceptance it's stigmatizing

2761
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:44,158
environment to use cannabis and even

2762
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,198
though when patients might be

2763
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:46,479
hospitalized for

2764
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:48,960
things where cannabis could actually

2765
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:51,759
help their symptoms so i would you know

2766
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,439
oftentimes prescribe like thc pills you

2767
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,800
know the patients from the pharmacy so

2768
01:30:53,439 --> 01:30:56,638
as a way to

2769
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:59,679
you know use some aspect of cannabis in

2770
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:02,319
a legal in a legal framework

2771
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:04,079
but but now i've seen um there are some

2772
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:05,359
hospitals that are allowing cannabis in

2773
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:08,399
their in their wards

2774
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:11,599
not everywhere but it's changed um we

2775
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:14,719
had patients at children's hospital

2776
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,039
in the last couple years where um they

2777
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:17,039
all

2778
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:18,238
are allowing children to bring in

2779
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:20,880
cannabis that their

2780
01:31:18,238 --> 01:31:22,399
parents are bringing in administering um

2781
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,719
as long as they've had they've gone

2782
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:24,238
through

2783
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,840
some kind of approval process that they

2784
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:26,238
have on the inside which goes through

2785
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,400
their

2786
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:29,519
pediatric attending doctor and some

2787
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:33,920
regulatory

2788
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:36,239
setup and you know it it changes the um

2789
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,520
the stigma significantly the child now

2790
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:39,839
you know and family members

2791
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,440
don't have to hide it and and it's it's

2792
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,800
um you know on

2793
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:44,638
i've had some patients where they put it

2794
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,679
on the white board you know their family

2795
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,840
members are writing

2796
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:50,480
like this is what we're doing and so

2797
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,319
that's been kind of a changing

2798
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:54,158
there is an opening there happening i

2799
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:55,599
would say in the hospitals

2800
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:57,759
and then i contacted the department of

2801
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,199
health in washington and they had said

2802
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,280
oh you know we don't have any

2803
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:02,319
problems to patients using cannabis in

2804
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:03,840
facilities like

2805
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:05,439
it's not it's not anything that the

2806
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,440
state of washington is

2807
01:32:05,439 --> 01:32:10,158
um limiting you know they they have

2808
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:12,960
granted these rights to patients

2809
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:13,920
and so anyway it's it's kind of a uh

2810
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,679
there but

2811
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,199
all of that said there are definitely

2812
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:17,679
facilities that are still out there that

2813
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:21,439
are

2814
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:24,239
uh far more um tied into um federal

2815
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:26,399
pools of money um and just say hey we

2816
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:29,039
don't allow that here

2817
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,000
and in those cases patients have to be

2818
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:33,198
um

2819
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,719
you know um discrete um this is probably

2820
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:37,678
a good point for us to give a

2821
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:39,119
loving shout out to nurses right because

2822
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:42,399
there is no doubt

2823
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:44,559
that nurses their creativity and

2824
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:47,119
hearts and knowledge are there at the

2825
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:49,920
center of these decisions between

2826
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:51,519
the doctor and the family and sometimes

2827
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,679
the gray market right

2828
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,360
i mean so often i have come across

2829
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:56,880
nurses who are like okay i've got a

2830
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:58,960
patient who uses cannabis

2831
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:01,039
at home they're in hospice but they're

2832
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,198
moving into the facility now

2833
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:04,800
and i'm trying to move their medicine

2834
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:06,839
into the facility

2835
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,279
what are the methods that are most

2836
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:10,960
discreet and you know i i play that role

2837
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:12,639
i can i can share with them it's it's

2838
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,198
for them in the family to decide right

2839
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:17,199
but

2840
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:19,439
um nurses play such an important role in

2841
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:22,559
making sure that the patient gets the

2842
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:26,479
care that the patient wants oh that's

2843
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:29,760
amen amen to nurses they have definitely

2844
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:32,319
played a critical role um there's

2845
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,840
one nurse who's been a huge leader in

2846
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:35,840
the national

2847
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,920
you know american nurses association's

2848
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:41,520
largest organization of nurses

2849
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:44,719
um her name is mary lynn mathery

2850
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:45,520
and she has um you know been a huge

2851
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,319
leader from

2852
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,880
for decades on cannabis and medicine

2853
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:51,198
starting

2854
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,239
professional education doing her own

2855
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:54,079
research about

2856
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:56,959
her own master's research when she was

2857
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:58,800
in graduate school about cannabis and

2858
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,480
you know talking to doctors and how it's

2859
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,760
important to have an open lines of

2860
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:04,238
communication

2861
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,679
so i just wanted to put shout out to

2862
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:07,439
mary lynn because

2863
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:09,440
and then of course many many nurses have

2864
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:11,039
now come forth and started cannabis

2865
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:13,439
nursing associations and

2866
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:15,039
all across the country and um they've

2867
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:17,039
really taken the mantle on

2868
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:19,279
to advocate for patients and and to kind

2869
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:20,800
of help them toe that line

2870
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:22,319
yeah for family members who are

2871
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,279
listening who are thinking about going

2872
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:25,920
in this direction

2873
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,639
with their with their family i highly

2874
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:29,440
recommend

2875
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:30,560
finding a nurse that is uh educated and

2876
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:32,879
pro-cannabis

2877
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,400
as an ally because you know you're not

2878
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,679
going to do anything that's going to be

2879
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:38,079
more effective

2880
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:40,158
towards winning than than allying with a

2881
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:42,800
good nurse

2882
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:44,158
that's right yeah yeah so so sunil

2883
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,480
before we wrap up here

2884
01:34:44,158 --> 01:34:48,638
you know i've heard you speak a number

2885
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:50,000
of times and one of the things that i

2886
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:51,600
really enjoy

2887
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,840
is is when you get to the part of your

2888
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,960
presentation where you talk about

2889
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:57,679
humans having a right to use healing

2890
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,880
plants

2891
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:03,600
and you know certainly cannabis has been

2892
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,719
you know taboo for many decades but

2893
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,360
before that

2894
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:09,439
you know it was 70 of the pharmacopoeia

2895
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:12,799
we used it for everything

2896
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:15,279
and and then it fell out of favor and

2897
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:16,159
with the government because it was uh it

2898
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:19,198
was you know

2899
01:35:16,158 --> 01:35:20,559
used as a scare tactic and and so now

2900
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:23,279
everything's kind of a mess

2901
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,239
and and it's and it's slowly coming back

2902
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:25,519
but at the end

2903
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:27,359
you know this is a plant that's

2904
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,880
naturally occurring and

2905
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:30,559
um you know i'd just like to you to

2906
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,520
speak to the idea

2907
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,880
that um that that that the plant is

2908
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,719
naturally occurring

2909
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:38,159
and and it's something that we should

2910
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:42,560
have as an option

2911
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:45,839
as a patient at any point in our life

2912
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:49,280
well you you said it i amen i mean

2913
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:52,239
there there's no i don't think there's

2914
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:52,559
i i i i don't think there's much else to

2915
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:57,519
say

2916
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:59,760
it's just simply the fact that we are

2917
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,360
i mean my area of interest is a human

2918
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,840
environment relationship and

2919
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:05,759
that's i came i came into medicine

2920
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,600
having a background in

2921
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,960
in geography a human environment

2922
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,000
relationship and how it applies to

2923
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,760
health and disease to

2924
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,319
access the resources the therapeutic

2925
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,960
resources the healing power of natural

2926
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:17,519
landscapes and nature and you know all

2927
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:20,079
this

2928
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,840
critical ecology that that that we're

2929
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:24,319
part of that determines

2930
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,840
you know uh illness and and access to

2931
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:27,920
health resources so it's

2932
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,880
health health and the environment is

2933
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:32,158
integral to

2934
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:33,600
our um you know to who we are as humans

2935
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:36,000
to our evolution

2936
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,360
our connection to all other life on the

2937
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,520
planet i mean it's a

2938
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:41,198
it is a we we are cannabis and humans

2939
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,840
are and all these these plants are

2940
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:44,319
actually like

2941
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,440
distant cousins on the evolutionary like

2942
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:48,639
you know

2943
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:49,118
tree of life so it it to me was always

2944
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:52,480
very

2945
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:54,079
um you know the the idea that you have a

2946
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:57,118
natural right to

2947
01:36:54,079 --> 01:37:00,319
um you know the bounties or the

2948
01:36:57,118 --> 01:37:03,519
to natural plant resources um

2949
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:06,399
is a very old concept in in in

2950
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:08,320
law and you know i'm i don't know i

2951
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:12,079
think it's called natural rights

2952
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:14,238
um and the the idea that the state

2953
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:15,279
that what is the compelling interest of

2954
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:18,319
the state to

2955
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:20,000
limit somebody's right to access um you

2956
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:22,158
know natural resources

2957
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,520
and that that's where you know that's a

2958
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:25,439
social contract question

2959
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,199
it's like well you know what limits are

2960
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:30,319
are are there for

2961
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:33,359
for example safety or resource

2962
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:33,679
conservation so you know you might say

2963
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:35,599
oh

2964
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:37,039
you know if everybody took all the

2965
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,039
firewood from this area

2966
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:40,158
then the wood you know it collected as

2967
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:42,560
much as they wanted then

2968
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:43,920
then there'd be no none left for for

2969
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,239
everyone's needs and

2970
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:47,039
and so there has to be a limit or if you

2971
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:48,959
say you know

2972
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:51,118
i don't want people collecting this

2973
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:54,239
particular um

2974
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:56,079
rare um rare bird or

2975
01:37:54,238 --> 01:37:57,359
you know making these kind of endangered

2976
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:59,359
species pets because

2977
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:01,279
this this species at risk of extinction

2978
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:04,399
there's this huge

2979
01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:07,279
you know global uh social

2980
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:09,519
reason to to withhold um you know

2981
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:11,279
trading an endangered species and

2982
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,639
and conserving resources that are very

2983
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:15,519
limited

2984
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:17,039
um and that's that's you know that's

2985
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,080
pretty much the limits that we play and

2986
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:18,560
then and then i guess the other one

2987
01:38:18,079 --> 01:38:21,359
would be

2988
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,920
um like how much verizon can you make

2989
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:24,039
ricin

2990
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:26,639
is a you know naturally occurring like

2991
01:38:24,039 --> 01:38:27,439
bioterrorism biotoxin which you can you

2992
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,600
can grow from

2993
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,118
from plants and so there's limits on

2994
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,360
that for the safety

2995
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:36,158
of of people's ability to you know be

2996
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:38,479
free from bioterrorism attacks

2997
01:38:36,158 --> 01:38:39,599
so those are really the the idea that

2998
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:42,319
there's these

2999
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,760
plant medicines that are going to be so

3000
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:46,960
dangerous for you

3001
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,840
that you know uh so you're gonna abuse

3002
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,600
them so much

3003
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,679
and they're they're so unsafe and we

3004
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,280
have to take them away from people

3005
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:55,840
that's sort of the that's the sort of

3006
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:56,479
overreach that infringes on that natural

3007
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,960
right and

3008
01:38:56,479 --> 01:39:00,319
people have to really you know ask the

3009
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,480
question is there

3010
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:04,158
is there a compelling interest of the

3011
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:06,000
government to limit this

3012
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:07,920
um you know natural connection or you

3013
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,279
know or to completely in the case of

3014
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,079
cannabis or these other natural

3015
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:13,679
medicines like

3016
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:16,079
completely you know remove it from

3017
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:16,800
entirely sever the relationship you know

3018
01:39:16,079 --> 01:39:18,719
like uh

3019
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,039
legally speaking there's no legal

3020
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,760
context there's no legal way that you

3021
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:23,279
can um

3022
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,199
have a connection with these these

3023
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:27,840
natural um

3024
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:28,638
medicinal plants um and and that's that

3025
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:31,679
to me is

3026
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:33,760
is is what it comes down to you know uh

3027
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,719
do we really think that that's a that's

3028
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,560
a valid um

3029
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,840
reach of our of our government and is

3030
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,280
there a compelling

3031
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,319
and that that comes down to well what is

3032
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:41,039
the argument they're making they're

3033
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:43,679
saying it's very

3034
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:44,158
unsafe and dangerous and i think that's

3035
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,880
um

3036
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:48,079
you know been proven wrong so uh and and

3037
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,760
you know the fact that there's a long

3038
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:51,600
traditional history of use

3039
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,679
already um should have proven that

3040
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:56,480
lauren a long time ago

3041
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:58,239
and and i think that's um that's the

3042
01:39:56,479 --> 01:40:00,399
mess that you talked about you know that

3043
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:02,238
we kind of took these political

3044
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:04,319
um we took these allowed the government

3045
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:08,000
to take these steps of overreach

3046
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:10,319
um for naked racist political

3047
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
you know economic interest purposes and

3048
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:13,198
i'm sure some people along the way were

3049
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,118
convinced that there was

3050
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:16,960
oh some real danger here and we're doing

3051
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:17,759
this to you know save the children to

3052
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:20,560
protect our

3053
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:22,000
future or to you know like like getting

3054
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,960
rid of lead lead

3055
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,560
lead paint and lead gasoline you know um

3056
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,719
but this is not that

3057
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,480
and that's that's really where um if we

3058
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,118
don't have a historical context if we

3059
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:32,799
don't have

3060
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:34,158
uh knowledge of our traditions and we

3061
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:37,520
don't have a

3062
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:40,399
appreciation and reverence uh for

3063
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,600
the uh right to access and be part

3064
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:43,359
connected to nature

3065
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,360
we're gonna we were gonna just kind of

3066
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:47,599
give that up entirely and that's

3067
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:48,399
that's really um you know i think that's

3068
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,760
that's where i'm

3069
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:51,920
one of the struggles that i'm very

3070
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,600
passionate about and i appreciate you're

3071
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,000
asking me and it's not you know cannabis

3072
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,159
is one

3073
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,399
but i'm also there's a whole family of

3074
01:40:56,158 --> 01:41:01,439
um psychoactive biota

3075
01:40:58,399 --> 01:41:04,479
um you know um anthogen natural

3076
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:07,519
subsidement mushrooms and um

3077
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:08,559
like ergot fungus that has a lysergic

3078
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,320
acid in it

3079
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,000
or you know we mentioned peyote which

3080
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:15,840
has masculine in it

3081
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:18,479
ayahuasca which you know is a has

3082
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,960
a dmt in it and these are all substances

3083
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:20,879
that

3084
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,198
all these natural plants have chemicals

3085
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,600
in them that are like our brains

3086
01:41:22,198 --> 01:41:24,879
neurotransmitters they're

3087
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,800
you can call them neurotransmitter

3088
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,239
analogues and so you know nature has

3089
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:31,760
provided these amazing

3090
01:41:28,238 --> 01:41:32,000
um substances that that are you know fit

3091
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,239
like

3092
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,760
locks and keys in our in our body and

3093
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:38,479
that's no surprise because we're all

3094
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,760
evolutionarily connected so anyway it's

3095
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:40,638
just kind of a i think we're we're

3096
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,920
having a price

3097
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:46,560
a crisis of connection to the world

3098
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,600
and and to our own connection to the

3099
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,719
natural world and

3100
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:52,960
and a sense that the government is

3101
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:54,399
uh has passed laws that have tried to

3102
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,439
break that connection and that's where

3103
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:57,759
we're

3104
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:58,638
we're trying to get back on on footing

3105
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,480
and and

3106
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:02,319
and i think for as a doctor i can't i

3107
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:03,678
think without these kind of without

3108
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:04,238
addressing this problem we're never

3109
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,840
going to be

3110
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:07,599
we're never really going to achieve a

3111
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:10,480
public health about uh

3112
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:12,320
a a modicum of public health that that

3113
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:14,959

3114
