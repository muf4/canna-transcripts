1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:14,570
check check one hey who's life here is

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:17,719
better because of marijuana right so who

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:20,028
else here knows a patient or a friend

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:24,320
who's getting relief from an ailment

5
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:26,990
because of cannabis right cannabis is

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,679
healing humans and that is the important

7
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:33,890
part the problem is is last spring House

8
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:36,890
bill 50 50 to pass which dismantled

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,200
medical marijuana in our state right so

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,570
now we have to shop at the recreational

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,190
stores we've got friends and family who

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,530
we love who are not able to access the

13
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:50,899
specific medical kind of marijuana that

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,850
they need at the recreational stores I

15
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,769
mean we all love the smoke weed and

16
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,109
they've got that at their recreational

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,640
stores but they don't necessarily have

18
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,229
the medicine you're not going to get

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,430
Rick Simpson oi you're not going to get

20
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:06,798
high CBD tabs I'm Shango low some from

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,469
the shaping fire podcast and I also

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,979
represent the Trade Organization of bash

23
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:14,899
on Arab that's one Island marijuana the

24
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:18,379
important thing for us to remember here

25
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:21,200
is that just because the legislators

26
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:24,140
change the law and there and the

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,999
regulators have told us that hey man I

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,069
know that you've got ailments I know

29
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:30,560
that your loved ones have got ailments

30
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:33,889
you just have to stop growing you have

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,600
to stop providing from them I don't

32
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:40,728
think that's legitimate illegitimate

33
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:42,709
laws are meant unjust laws are meant to

34
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:45,649
be ignored and that is what I'm

35
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:49,099
suggesting that you do today ignore the

36
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:52,340
new laws that set patient limits to only

37
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:55,759
four plants per person I don't know any

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,819
patient that can survive on four plants

39
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,799
a year that means one of two things that

40
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:03,649
he means that you either have to move

41
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,979
your grown indoors and not grow under

42
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,460
the beautiful sun or you have to grow

43
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:11,469
outdoors only and

44
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,120
they have four plants a year how are you

45
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:16,780
going to take care of yourself for an

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,159
entire year on for plants you can't do

47
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,219
that even if you're just rolling joints

48
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,159
right got healthy if you have to make

49
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:26,740
your own RSO you need pounds to be able

50
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,740
to extract it down and concentrate it to

51
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,740
make your RSO to keep your rheumatoid

52
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,330
arthritis at bay to try to solve your

53
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,990
cancer you're not going to do this with

54
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:40,480
four plants it's frustrating right

55
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,550
because as patients we're constantly

56
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,729
reaching out to our legislators to say

57
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,730
hey we know that need the cats out of

58
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:50,769
the bag we all know now that cannabis is

59
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:52,780
healthy it's not hurting us it's not

60
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,700
addictive it doesn't lead to all these

61
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,500
bad reefer madness things we're

62
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,079
concerned about so how are you going to

63
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,389
take the plants back out of the

64
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,790
patient's hands Camaro this is why I

65
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:08,079
suggest ignore the new rules ignore the

66
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:11,289
fact that you're only supposed to allow

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,080
to have four plants I mean we used to be

68
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:18,189
able to have 15 and many patients needed

69
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,830
25 for are you kidding me eventually our

70
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:23,349
state will get in line right all the

71
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,570
other states allow a realistic home grow

72
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:28,019
as start and then we'll expand from

73
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:30,969
there six plus plans from there

74
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,340
Washington is a good place retweet we're

75
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:35,979
at the head of the medical cannabis

76
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,379
movement we should expect that to

77
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:40,329
continue forward but we need to give

78
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,530
them a little time well alright we're

79
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,420
going to give them a little bit of time

80
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,919
to change their regulations but that

81
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:48,669
does not mean that we need to stop

82
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:51,129
growing now for plants keep growing 15

83
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:53,769
if that's what you need to provide for

84
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:56,049
yourself and your family and your loved

85
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,840
ones you know what if you need 30 do

86
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,930
that as well the important thing here is

87
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,259
to realize that cannabis is a human

88
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,319
right

89
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:10,068
does the does the government owned the

90
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:12,859
plant no does the LCB on the planet no

91
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:14,658
and it sure as hell is not owned by the

92
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,209
502 stores that are selling the

93
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:20,029
recreational marijuana we could really

94
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,490
own the plan it's ours and if you are

95
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,069
presently a patient if you are presently

96
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,560
a grower if you presently have family

97
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:30,079
and loved ones that are growing for each

98
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,259
other I encourage you to continue to

99
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:37,009
grow ignore the law give a loss some

100
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:39,560
time to evolve but in until then just

101
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:42,199
ignore it and go your own way if enough

102
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,079
of us do that we will be secure because

103
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,660
they cannot bust us all and when they

104
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,889
try to bust one after another you know

105
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,930
that that's going to come up in the

106
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:55,639
press and the press is going to say what

107
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,889
the hell is going on here they say we

108
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,990
have legalization in our state but we do

109
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,870
not have legalization we have

110
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,360
corporatization and commercialization of

111
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,418
the plant they have given us just enough

112
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,030
Liberty just enough Liberty so that they

113
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:13,728
can get their taxes that's not what it's

114
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:15,769
about marijuana cannabis is about

115
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:17,779
healing humans and that is what I

116
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:20,359
encourage you to do annual ignore the

117
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:24,709
new laws throw your plans and hold out

118
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,479
until the laws evolve to where we are I
