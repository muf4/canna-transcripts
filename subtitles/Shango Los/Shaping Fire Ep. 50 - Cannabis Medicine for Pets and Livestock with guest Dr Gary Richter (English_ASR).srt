[Music]

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:11,968
so here we are at episode 50 in some

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,400
ways it feels like episode 104 because

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,829
before I started shaping fire I recorded

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,439
54 weekly episodes for my friends over

6
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:22,259
at ganja preneur calm but this episode

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,420
is number 50 of shaping fire the shaping

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,130
fire show is in its third year and some

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,320
folks ask me why there are only 50

10
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,538
episodes which works out to about two or

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,159
so a month belonging the short of it is

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,530
that to make a quality show

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,509
I can't just spit them out for most of

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,000
my guests I need to read their research

15
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,920
or their book or bone up on some aspect

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,689
of cannabis just so I can ask the

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,390
questions that you most want to hear

18
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,589
answered if I just asked generic

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,960
questions the show wouldn't be

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,309
particularly interesting and the number

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,170
one piece of feedback that I get from

22
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:54,479
folks is that they love my lines of

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,000
questioning so I make sure I take my

24
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,159
time when preparing a show also as an

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,170
interesting side note I went to college

26
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,578
on a full debate scholarship so that's

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,450
probably where the question-and-answer

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,219
skills come from also not only do I like

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,109
to take some time building a show but

30
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,329
I'm out in the field constantly learning

31
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:14,519
more and meeting new experts to bring

32
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:16,140
them to you on the show I'm down in

33
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,938
California a few times a year hearing

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,560
what farmers are saying and trying to

35
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,209
get introductions to hard people to

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,340
reach like Caleb Inspectah who was

37
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,048
recently on the show that interview took

38
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,299
almost a year to bring together but it

39
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,460
was hella worth it I also run my own

40
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,409
test garden and spend the bulk of my

41
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,269
time working with cannabis patients and

42
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,100
caregivers teaching them how to use

43
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:37,228
cannabis medicine and set up patient

44
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,699
grows it doesn't pay anything but it's

45
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:41,250
the most important part of all this to

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,829
me and while the podcast can now support

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,629
my basic needs through advertising I am

48
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:47,339
still doing some brand strategy and

49
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:48,569
business consulting for select clients

50
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,659
so I could afford the occasional

51
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:53,639
vacation you know I think because I am

52
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,439
involved in so many aspects of cannabis

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,599
and I'm not cloistered at home in the

54
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,639
studio that it offers you a perspective

55
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,048
that you won't find anywhere else but

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,829
that also means this will probably never

57
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,509
be a weekly show but we'll see and while

58
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:08,219
I can finally live off the commercials

59
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,530
on the show you'll notice that I still

60
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,169
don't have any bottled salt nutrient

61
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,830
companies as advertisers while most of

62
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:16,289
the industry

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,940
propped up by helping sell salts there's

64
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,709
no way I would take that kind of money

65
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,169
while being such a proponent of

66
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,330
regenerative agriculture poly culture

67
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:27,319
and organic cannabis farming techniques

68
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,280
I'm doing my best to walk my talk

69
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,560
similarly you may have realized that I'm

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,599
doing fewer shows on canvas business now

71
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,759
and more about cannabis health and

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,139
technique sure there are still shows

73
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,250
about the industry because I'm still

74
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,049
interested in that and I'm still very

75
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,819
much a part of that but you aren't gonna

76
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,370
find me doing a show about like track

77
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,769
and trace software the content I am

78
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,780
producing now is much more for hardcore

79
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,790
cannabis enthusiasts than it is

80
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,099
necessarily for business owners though I

81
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,689
love business owners too it's just that

82
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,489
I'm more interested in the plant and the

83
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:59,310
medicine than I am about spreadsheets

84
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,620
and regulatory changes so as you'd

85
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,349
expect shaping fire evolves like it

86
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,340
would over three years of the show

87
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,569

88
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,610

Shango lows today my guest is

124
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,569
veterinarian dr. Garry Richter I had the

125
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,310
pleasure of hearing dr. Richter speak at

126
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,659
Emerald cup a while back and have been

127
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,509
excited to have him on the show ever

128
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,640
since gary is a holistic veteran

129
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,250
and scientist with a practice in Oakland

130
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,500
California while Gary cannot legally use

131
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,329
cannabis in his practice being in

132
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,730
California means that he had to research

133
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:40,859
can have an apotheca s'en anyway just to

134
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,990
answer the questions of pet owners he

135
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,939
has become a national expert and is a

136
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,160
sought-after speaker and he's also a

137
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,560
really nice guy today we're gonna talk

138
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,820
about in detail the use of cannabis with

139
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,490
pets and livestock

140
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,500
welcome to the show Gary thank you great

141
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,810
to be here so glad you could join us so

142
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,089
let's start at the very basic because

143
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,579
you know we talk about cannabis medicine

144
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:04,560
on the show all the time and one of the

145
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,449
key aspects of cannabis medicine of

146
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,269
course is that it interacts with the

147
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,360
human endocannabinoid system and often

148
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:15,209
when we talk about cannabis and pets

149
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,220
people are often surprised that Oh an

150
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:19,019
animal has an endocannabinoid system too

151
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,290
and I generally explain to them that

152
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:24,629
that you know all mammals do to varying

153
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,600
degrees and and people are surprised

154
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:30,240
about that when you talk to people about

155
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,320
the endocannabinoid system and their pet

156
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,850
kind of explaining to them how it works

157
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,579
for the pet instead of the human how do

158
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,780
you go ahead and explain that to folks

159
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:41,009
yeah that's a really good question I

160
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,919
mean you know explaining the

161
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,659
endocannabinoid system can get can get

162
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,430
tricky even when you're when you're

163
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,370
trying to explain it to medical

164
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,199
professionals because you know remember

165
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,090
very very few medical professionals be

166
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,979
they physicians or veterinarians learned

167
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:58,829
anything about the endocannabinoid

168
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:02,280
system in medical school either but but

169
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:04,949
you know the way I approach it is is is

170
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,439
you know the endocannabinoid system it

171
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,149
is a system of neurotransmitters that

172
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,129
are present throughout the body both in

173
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:13,949
the central nervous system as well as in

174
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:16,139
the rest of the body and and and while

175
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,800
we could talk for days about all of the

176
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,659
various all of the various actions and

177
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,360
and physiologic responses that are

178
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,600
caused by the endocannabinoid system the

179
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,939
overarching message is that the

180
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,760
endocannabinoid system is designed to

181
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,219
promote what is called homeostasis which

182
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,480
means balance within the body so whether

183
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,130
you know whether there

184
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,520
some sort of physiologic stress and

185
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:43,529
illness and injury emotional stress the

186
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,599
endocannabinoid system can help balance

187
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,419
all of that out and keep the body on an

188
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,220
even keel that's fantastic and and I

189
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,410
think it's interesting to the idea that

190
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,040
that that the endocannabinoid system is

191
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:58,710
constantly bringing any system that is

192
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,030
running hot or running cold back to the

193
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,609
center and I think that's interesting

194
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:04,829
because people say how can cannabis

195
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,569
potentially help so many different

196
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:07,889
things and I tell folks it only really

197
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:09,449
helps one thing it helps your

198
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,519
endocannabinoid system it's just that

199
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,189
hat that happens to have its fingers and

200
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:17,849
everything sure yeah I mean it's it's

201
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:20,160
almost like it's almost like when people

202
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,340
talk about stem cell therapy and-and-and

203
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,380
stem cell therapy being able to treat

204
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:28,109
this incredibly wide range of medical

205
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:31,800
conditions is because it's because stem

206
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,600
cells are really at the root of of what

207
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,569
cells can be in the body and therefore

208
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,550
they can address so many different body

209
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,310
systems and and while endocannabinoids

210
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,420
are clearly not stem cells it is similar

211
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,470
in the sense that the endocannabinoid

212
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,180
system touches almost every system

213
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,970
within the body and therefore there is

214
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,220
the potential to utilize the

215
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,340
endocannabinoid system and and phyto

216
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,400
cannabinoids to to positively affect

217
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:02,129
those systems I think that in many cases

218
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,139
pet owners are pretty darn sophisticated

219
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,659
and with access to the Internet a lot of

220
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,430
folks are doing their research before

221
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,740
they even go to the doctor's office I

222
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,240
was curious you know when people come to

223
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,160
your office and I know that you don't

224
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,740
recommend cannabis in your practice

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,140
because of the laws in California

226
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,699
but people constantly come to you asking

227
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:25,019
about it which kind of forces the

228
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:27,209
question you know to be answered and do

229
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,310
you find that people generally already

230
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,919
know that their their pet has got an

231
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,779
endocannabinoid system or is is that

232
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,789
very advanced for just about everybody

233
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,860
you talk to coming in you know what I

234
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,889
think a lot of people that come in while

235
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,000
they may have seen the term

236
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:45,809
endocannabinoid system somewhere either

237
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,549
on the internet or wherever they don't

238
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,349
really have a firm ground

239
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:53,490
but exactly what that means or how it

240
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:55,950
applies but what they do know is that

241
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,379
there is the potential for cannabis as

242
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,390
medicine to help their pet and while

243
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,278
many of them may not be concerned with

244
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,100
the with the specifics and the science

245
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,289
of the Y they certainly are concerned

246
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,230
with what can I do to help my animal

247
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:11,490
yeah you know sometimes people will come

248
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,810
to me and we'll be talking about pets

249
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,579
and they'll say you know I understand

250
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:16,379
there's this thing called

251
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:19,049
endocannabinoid deficiency and you know

252
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:20,820
they've often read dr. Ethan Russo's

253
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:23,159
papers about endocannabinoid deficiency

254
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,660
in humans and they're all like you know

255
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,889
how do I tell if my my animal has got

256
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:30,120
endocannabinoid deficiency and I usually

257
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,370
tell them you know what there's not even

258
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,370
tests for that in humans what do you

259
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,259
tell them well I that's that's pretty

260
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,570
much the long and short of it I mean

261
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,120
even even for people I mean you know

262
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,459
even Russo's paper on endocannabinoid

263
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,549
system deficiencies which is a fantastic

264
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:50,549
paper you know a lot of it is

265
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:53,429
speculative you know because we're

266
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:56,399
really we're really at the very very

267
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:59,129
early stages of understanding the the

268
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,019
more subtle nuances of how the

269
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:03,689
endocannabinoids system works and

270
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,789
there's certainly no diagnostic testing

271
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,490
on the veterinary side to be able to

272
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:11,159
measure endocannabinoid tone if you will

273
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,810
and that actually kind of feeds into the

274
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,429
kind of a general theme today that we're

275
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:17,278
probably gonna run into a bunch of times

276
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:19,979
which is these studies haven't been done

277
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:23,879
yet and so a lot of the insight that

278
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,879
you're going to be offering is is based

279
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:30,778
on kind of a combination of anecdotal

280
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,519
evidence your intuition you know stories

281
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:34,588
that you've heard come back to you and

282
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,559
and you know you're you're very

283
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,730
experienced hunches and and I know that

284
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,919
you know you you you've said that you'll

285
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,509
point those out when they're more

286
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,099
hunches than anything but I think it's

287
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,588
important for people to realize real

288
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,079
clearly upfront that these studies

289
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,180
generally have not been done but people

290
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,979
are asking so many of these questions

291
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,379
that we decided to go ahead and do an

292
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,629
episode about it kind of like the this

293
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,389
this the state of the art like you know

294
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:00,720
the the best we know so far

295
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:02,490
yeah you

296
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,790
and that's true and and but one other

297
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:08,299
thing to mention is there's certainly a

298
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:11,579
lot more clinical data out there

299
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:14,009
regarding cannabis as it as it affects

300
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,670
humans from a medical perspective and

301
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:22,080
while clearly a person is not a dog nor

302
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:23,490
nor a cat you know they are all complex

303
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,040
mammals and they all have an

304
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,590
endocannabinoid system so while we may

305
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,620
not be able to necessarily you know draw

306
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:34,500
direct correlations from one to the next

307
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,720
there's enough similarities here to

308
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,700
where if we have reasonable scientific

309
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,529
data on the human side there is an

310
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,360
expectation that we would see similar

311
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:43,919
effects on the veterinary side awesome

312
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,399
yeah that's a really good clarification

313
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,870
there are there are a lot of very

314
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,250
reasonable similarities and jumps that

315
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,710
we can make and we'll probably be doing

316
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,620
some of that today so all right so now

317
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,269
that people generally have an idea of

318
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,710
what we're trying to interact with in

319
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,490
the animals that were talking about

320
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:05,370
today I have have taken the kinds of

321
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,680
animals and topics that that people ask

322
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,590
me about most often and let's go through

323
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:14,729
them over the next you know hour or so

324
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:16,410
and talk about each so that whoever's

325
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,750
listening they're their particular

326
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:22,069
animal with that particular issue will

327
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,909
hopefully come up and by far most

328
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,470
everybody is talking to me about their

329
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,990
cats and dogs and I'm figuring that's

330
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:32,399
probably the same for you and the number

331
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:34,740
one question I get is my domestic pet is

332
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,480
getting old and their joints or

333
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,700
arthritis or they're just not they don't

334
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,090
have the the same get-up-and-go because

335
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,589
it hurts for them to get up and go and

336
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,230
people are asking me all right so they

337
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:49,080
often come to me for the CBD and and

338
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,720
then we often talk about the TIA we talk

339
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,280
about THC instead for the

340
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,970
anti-inflammatory so when people are

341
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:00,899
talking to you about simple joint pain

342
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,950
for a house pet what kind of guidance do

343
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,588
you give them or what kind of

344
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:07,200
perspective do you set them up with well

345
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,810
you know as it pertains to cannabis that

346
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,590
that happens to be one of the areas

347
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:12,599
where we do

348
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,300
have a little bit of scientific data on

349
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,850
the on the veterinary side there was a

350
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:21,929
study that was published last year out

351
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:25,139
of Cornell that looked at using CBD to

352
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:27,719
treat arthritis pain and dogs and what

353
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,879
they found was is that is that CBD was

354
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,450
in fact effective at controlling

355
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,919
arthritis pain and dog so that is as I

356
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,230
say it's one of the few areas where we

357
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,409
actually have some real data

358
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,870
you know perhaps the the bigger question

359
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:45,419
or at least the other question is is

360
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,659
okay well if CBDs effective what about

361
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:50,759
THC what about other cannabinoids and

362
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,889
that is something that we really don't

363
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,319
know definitively yet although again

364
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:58,110
going back to the human literature we do

365
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,300
know that THC or a combination of THC

366
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,690
and CBD can be very very beneficial to

367
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:05,459
treat people with pain and and as such

368
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,370
it's it's probably reasonable to assume

369
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,759
that similar things could be could be

370
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,830
experienced by dogs and cats now the so

371
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:18,509
the the trick to all of this of course

372
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:21,180
is is is what product and what dose and

373
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:23,009
that's you know that's where that that's

374
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:25,500
where the you know the rubber hits the

375
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:27,210
road so to speak as it pertains to it's

376
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,929
a sort of veterinary medicine or human

377
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:34,379
medicine and and the use of cannabis so

378
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:35,969
that's something that you know as I'm

379
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:39,750
sure you and your and your listeners

380
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:42,690
know really plays a huge bearing on the

381
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,700
effect of any any kind of cannabis

382
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,220
preparation you know the varying either

383
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,500
amounts or ratios of cannabinoids

384
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,879
terpenes what-have-you and that's that's

385
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,470
that's really where we need to be

386
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,490
looking and where we need to be focusing

387
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:59,879
yeah you know I often which wish that I

388
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,529
could speak to these dogs and cats that

389
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,250
people come to me and then they say oh

390
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:08,309
we've got our dog and we we gave it just

391
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,740
a little bit of THC based tincture

392
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:12,750
because it had joint pain and we were

393
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,539
hoping for the inflammation to go down

394
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:19,169
enough that the dog can you know yeah

395
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:22,649
heck sometimes just go outside to to

396
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:24,000
defecate you know and and so people will

397
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:27,360
give their animal just

398
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,009
little bit of THC you know maybe maybe a

399
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,710
milligram maybe a milligram and a half a

400
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:34,019
very very small amount and then and then

401
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:36,090
the dog will you know you know you know

402
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,740
get up and kind of lumber around and

403
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,690
seem like it's in good spirits and step

404
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,230
out and I'm always curious to know

405
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:45,750
whether or not is this the dog

406
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:48,690
experiencing muscle relaxation and less

407
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:51,450
tension of the muscles and less

408
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,720
inflammation somehow in the moment or is

409
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:57,390
it just that the dog somehow is

410
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,940
experiencing a pleasant cannabis

411
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:02,250
experience like so many of us have which

412
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,190
kind of changed their mood and caused

413
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,940
them to get up because we try to

414
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:11,370
anthropomorphize their actions and and

415
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,290
it's so important what the motivation of

416
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,860
the actions are when we're talking about

417
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:20,009
dosing humans and the doses are so much

418
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,470
more sensitive and and and lower for an

419
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:24,269
animal it it it makes it very

420
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,149
challenging to come up since there's no

421
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:29,338
studies yet yeah I mean it is very

422
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:33,120
challenging but you know one thing that

423
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:37,380
we do know with dogs in particular is

424
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,929
that dogs actually have a greater number

425
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:42,570
and a greater concentration of cb1

426
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:46,679
receptors in their brainstem then do

427
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:49,230
people and as such they are much more

428
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:53,009
sensitive to the potential toxic effects

429
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:57,120
of THC then would be a human on a sort

430
00:16:53,009 --> 00:17:00,419
of on a per weight basis so what that

431
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,610
means is is that is that we do have to

432
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:05,039
be very very cautious with the amount of

433
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,049
THC a dog gets now you mentioned like a

434
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,899
half a milligram or one milligram of THC

435
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:12,899
now it kind of depends on the size of

436
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,660
the dog you know for fur so for example

437
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,269
for a medium to a large sized dog

438
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:21,300
probably a milligram of THC is not going

439
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:23,220
to have any any outward effects in a

440
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,750
negative sense like the dogs not going

441
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,140
to be high the dogs not going to be

442
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:31,039
experiencing THC toxicity but that said

443
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,500
it's possible that even at that low dose

444
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,178
the you know that amount of THC could be

445
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,309
providing some pain relief could be

446
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,290
providing some real

447
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:40,789
sation as you say I mean it's very

448
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,440
difficult to get any kind of direct

449
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:45,980
feedback from a veterinary patient so

450
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,230
all we really have to go on is is how

451
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,230
they're acting how you know how they're

452
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,870
moving around because you know from the

453
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:57,680
dogs perspective there is no placebo

454
00:17:53,869 --> 00:18:00,379
effect here now certainly as a human

455
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,630
perceptual issue we we may read things

456
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,790
into it that aren't there and that you

457
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,040
know that as a placebo effect in and of

458
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:08,480
itself but you know if the dog is

459
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,240
unquestionably doing things that

460
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,140
otherwise wasn't doing the only

461
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
explanation for that is because they

462
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,700
feel better yeah yeah that makes sense

463
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,430
and also you know kind of to relate that

464
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,769
to the humans and and we talk about this

465
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,620
often on the show where people are

466
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:26,660
experiencing or they're looking for

467
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:29,559
relief from something but they really

468
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,810
don't want to experience any level of

469
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,970
you know THC euphoria or intoxication

470
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,859
and so we always tell people that you

471
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:40,250
know take two point five milligrams four

472
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:43,129
times a day and you may never feel it

473
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:46,400
but it's still epi those those clinical

474
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,980
doses still causing muscle relaxation

475
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,720
and causing anti-inflammation it's just

476
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,759
not a high enough dose that you're there

477
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,559
getting anything in your head and and

478
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,500
and I think that's that's exactly what

479
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,019
you're describing for the veterinary

480
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,150
patients as well yeah you know that's

481
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:04,160
that's very true as a you know when I

482
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,540
speak to groups of pet owners or groups

483
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,730
of veterinarians I mean I very

484
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:10,670
frequently tell them that that it is

485
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:13,279
just like with a person it is absolutely

486
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:16,039
possible to put an animal on tac and

487
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,680
have them not be high it's just a

488
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:20,899
function of understanding how many

489
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,019
milligrams you're giving relative to the

490
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,900
body weight and or species of the of the

491
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:29,079
particular animal that you're treating

492
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:32,900
and and to go along with that

493
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:35,689
you know therapeutic dosing so so you

494
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:39,200
know doses of say THC that have a

495
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:41,570
positive effect medically speaking do

496
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,090
not have to be psychoactive doses

497
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:46,309
there's plenty of space in the in the in

498
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:48,259
the therapeutic dosing window that are

499
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:50,118
well below whatever would cause psycho

500
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:52,068
activity and a human or an animal

501
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:53,358
and you can still get benefit from it I

502
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:55,788
mean look at all these people that are

503
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:58,098
out there that are that are functioning

504
00:19:55,788 --> 00:20:00,278
members of society that rely on cannabis

505
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:03,078
you know to get through their day

506
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:05,598
because they have pain or anxiety or

507
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:06,798
whatever it is that they may have you

508
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:10,068
know those people are not walking around

509
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,769
high you know it's just that you know

510
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:14,598
like with any medication you have to

511
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:17,028
understand what you're giving and what

512
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:21,188
dosage you're giving I think it's

513
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:21,189
important to to point out that while

514
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:25,399
let's see how do I want to go into this

515
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:27,709
so I'm gonna start with the anecdote so

516
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:29,838
over the course of my life of using

517
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:33,078
cannabis I have been in the presence of

518
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:36,378
other people who have had pets and at

519
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:39,469
some point they got the the the pet hype

520
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:41,688
you know by blowing smoke in their ear

521
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:44,808
or whatever that you know have seen

522
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:47,239
happen and and at some point the pet

523
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:49,519
decided that it liked it so that so that

524
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:52,159
when I'm over at their house and and

525
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,858
they light up the the the would say a

526
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,689
dog the dog here's the lighter and so

527
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:58,638
the dog comes in the room and it's kind

528
00:20:56,689 --> 00:21:01,189
of begging for it I always found that to

529
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:05,088
be really extraordinary both because I

530
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:08,689
did not think it was fun or funny to

531
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:10,818
dose an unsuspecting animal but since it

532
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:13,819
had already been done and I was there

533
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:16,578
and the animal seemed to want more I

534
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:20,298
found that to be a rather interesting

535
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:23,148
data point do you have any you know

536
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:25,548
feedback from your your patients and

537
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:30,048
their owners about pets that have

538
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:31,908
acquired a desire for more of it you

539
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:34,338
know that's honestly that's not

540
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:36,619
something that I've really come across I

541
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:39,229
mean I you know I feel pretty strongly

542
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:40,908
that that you know that kind of that

543
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:42,409
kind of activity like intentionally

544
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:44,209
blowing smoke in your dog's face or

545
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:47,329
something that I mean that's that's not

546
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:49,038
okay and in fact that that borders on

547
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:52,219
animal abuse

548
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:54,318
you know partially because you know

549
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:56,419
these animals are not equipped nor aware

550
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:58,908
of what's coming from a psycho activity

551
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:00,469
standpoint and also because you know

552
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:03,109
what I mean inhaling smoke is not

553
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:03,529
necessarily good for anybody and I

554
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:05,269
certainly

555
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:08,029
not good for dogs and cats and if you

556
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:09,680
know and if if cannabis as medicine is

557
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:11,779
something that they benefit from and and

558
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,539
one could speculate you know what if

559
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:16,250
that individual dog seems to seek it out

560
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:18,109
maybe there's something that dog is

561
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,910
getting from it medically speaking you

562
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:21,619
know maybe something hurts less or maybe

563
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,350
they just generally feel better and if

564
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:26,899
that's the case then then you know

565
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:29,899
that's when it's time to investigate a

566
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,360
more responsible use of medical cannabis

567
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,550
rather than what I went to what I would

568
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:37,009
describe as irresponsible use of

569
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:39,470
recreational cannabis yeah right on that

570
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:41,529
makes sense to me so so we talked a

571
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:46,100
little bit about the potentiality for

572
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:49,099
the use of both CBD and THC to decrease

573
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:53,569
you know pain and joint pain just

574
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:56,929
general body aches of a older domestic

575
00:22:53,569 --> 00:23:00,829
pet people have started writing online

576
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:03,370
that they're using CBD to rebalance the

577
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:06,439
endocannabinoid system so their pets

578
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:07,969
don't have allergies and and I've never

579
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,799
run into this aunt with an animal before

580
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,740
so I don't know how I would know that my

581
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:15,349
pet has an allergy and what it's to and

582
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,150
then to choose to treat it with CBD but

583
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:21,109
what do you what do you have in that

584
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:23,180
category you know of all of the things

585
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:25,479
that I've seen animals benefit from

586
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,910
cannabis for I mean allergies is not

587
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,190
it's not at the top of the list you know

588
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:33,050
I you know as as we have mentioned I

589
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,910
mean cannabis and it's in its many forms

590
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,549
it does have anti-inflammatory

591
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:39,800
properties it does have sort of overall

592
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:43,669
immune system and body balancing

593
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:46,609
properties by virtue of promoting

594
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,950
homeostasis as we discussed before I

595
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:52,339
have in fact on a couple of occasions

596
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:54,980
seen topical cannabis products used on

597
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:56,809
animals that seemed to have helped a

598
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,940
little bit with itching and allergy so I

599
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:01,159
think you know there may be something

600
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,480
there although like I say I mean you

601
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,250
know you look at all of the various

602
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,750
things that cannabis is used for you

603
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,430
know in people as well

604
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,769
and you know I mean treating our Jesus

605
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,840
you know it's not super high on that

606
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:14,210
list of things I think there are there

607
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,168
are there are other options out there

608
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,850
both natural medicine why

609
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:19,859
and if necessary pharmaceutically

610
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:20,519
speaking that probably would work a

611
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,099
little better

612
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:25,618
one thing I've seen for sure is when

613
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:29,339
folks will administer small amounts of

614
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:33,678
THC to there you know domestic animal

615
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:36,569
that for for pain or something often

616
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,940
they will get the munchies and you can

617
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:41,999
just see them go to town on on their

618
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,190
food and and people are often overjoyed

619
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:46,589
because like oh my gosh the the animal

620
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,909
had had so much it was in pain and they

621
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,108
weren't getting a lot of movement and

622
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:51,570
they didn't even want to go over to

623
00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:53,428
their food bowl and now suddenly there's

624
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:55,499
movement and they just totally cleaned

625
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:59,989
out the bowl and so they they kind of

626
00:24:55,499 --> 00:25:02,399
help bring the pet back to health by by

627
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:04,528
leaning on what I'm assuming is going to

628
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:08,278
be the MIR scene in the in the THC

629
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:11,460
preparation have you seen that taken

630
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:14,278
place in your practice you know I'm not

631
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,379
honestly convinced that cannabis is is

632
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:18,778
directly an appetite stimulant and

633
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:20,819
animals like you know from from like the

634
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:23,608
munchies standpoint but what I think we

635
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:25,108
do see is because a lot of the animals

636
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:28,678
that are receiving these medications

637
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:30,118
they're you know they're not eating or

638
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,129
they're not eating well because they

639
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:34,709
don't feel good you know they feel sick

640
00:25:32,128 --> 00:25:36,480
whether they have an upset stomach or

641
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,579
they're in pain or there's something

642
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,710
else going on I mean you know I think we

643
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,599
all know from our own health that when

644
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,608
you you know when you feel crappy you

645
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,408
know going out and eating a bunch it's

646
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:49,230
not necessarily always you know your

647
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:50,820
first priority and I think what happens

648
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,999
with these guys is oftentimes we see

649
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:56,009
them eat better because they feel better

650
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:58,350
so they're not they're not in pain

651
00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:00,179
anymore maybe their stomach upset is is

652
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,128
relieved and therefore they're gonna eat

653
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,629
more but you know like I say I'm not I'm

654
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:06,028
not a hundred percent convinced it's

655
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:07,488
directly appetite stimulating in the

656
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:10,409
sense that like people get the munchies

657
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:13,649
see this is another great quest that

658
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:16,649
we'd love to ask them you know you'd

659
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:18,538
really love to yeah totally so I ran

660
00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:24,928
into something new recently someone

661
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:27,778
using a mere seem dominant THC tincture

662
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:28,590
with their pet after surgery so they

663
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:30,179
they had

664
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:32,099
pet that had normally has a lot of

665
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,580
energy and was gonna be jumping around

666
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,778
and they did not wanted to give it

667
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:39,720
traditional

668
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:42,390
I don't know pharmaceuticals to dope out

669
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,400
the animal after the surgery but they

670
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,580
were still concerned about the sutures

671
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,980
getting ripped open or just a little

672
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:52,769
give letting them have the time to get

673
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,659
over the trauma of the surgery and so

674
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:57,450
what they did is they they use this

675
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:59,789
tincture and they intentionally got

676
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:03,120
their dog a little high but the dog

677
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:06,778
seemed fine and relaxed and just kind of

678
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,668
chilled out around them for the next few

679
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:11,250
days and then they you know then they

680
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,380
stopped the the dosing and that the dog

681
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:16,140
kind of perked back up and went on its

682
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,360
merry way and you know outside of the

683
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,549
the discussion that we've already had

684
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:21,898
that you've got to be really darn and

685
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:24,690
careful with dosing and we're gonna talk

686
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:29,819
more about dosing after the break what

687
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:34,220
do you think about you know the use of a

688
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:37,048
THC tincture to kind of slow down or I

689
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,339
don't know incapacitate an animal so

690
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:41,278
that they can get through they're more

691
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,538
important healing you know it's it's a

692
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,148
really interesting question because

693
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:47,220
because well like in my mind my

694
00:27:45,148 --> 00:27:48,869
immediate sort of knee-jerk response was

695
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,750
gonna be you know what that's a bad idea

696
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:52,979
but you know when I when I look at the

697
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,798
when I look at the kinds of

698
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,169
pharmaceuticals that we typically use in

699
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:01,619
veterinary medicine for just that

700
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:04,169
purpose so so post surgical animals to

701
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:07,819
keep them calm to keep them from being

702
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:11,340
too active after a surgery I mean

703
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:14,668
effectively that's kind of what we're

704
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:17,849
doing is we're intentionally sedating

705
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:20,820
the dog or the cat or whatever so

706
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:24,209
they're not excessively active so you

707
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:27,000
know is giving is giving say like a

708
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:29,880
pharmaceutical like trazadone is that is

709
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,480
that demonstrably better than somebody

710
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,460
giving an appropriate dose of a you know

711
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,460
a cannabis preparation with THC and

712
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,960
mersin I mean honestly I don't actually

713
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,480
know the answer to that question that's

714
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,548
one of those

715
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,099
things that down the road I think

716
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:48,730
research would be really fascinating to

717
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:50,709
start to look at like at like

718
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,169
physiologic parameters like you know

719
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,509
heart rate and respiration rate and and

720
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,520
pain you know pain response it'd be

721
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,619
really fascinating to see if cannabis

722
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:04,869
you know can be appropriately used in

723
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:06,909
that sense you know clearly it is going

724
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:09,219
to be extremely difficult if not

725
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:10,990
impossible for a pet owner to get any

726
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,190
kind of guidance in that regards from a

727
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:17,650
veterinarian so you know that as you say

728
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:20,140
that just it rolls us back around to

729
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,650
that discussion of dosing and I think

730
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,850
that that's that's particularly

731
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,220
important with this particular scenario

732
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:29,109
biggest now now we're talking about

733
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:32,440
really getting up close to the line

734
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:34,959
between a therapeutic dose and what and

735
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,410
what would be considered a toxic dose

736
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,200
yeah so so let's pick up this dosing

737
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,759
conversation after the first break you

738

789
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:31,439
ashley Villafranca owner of the toke

790
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,029
shop I came to cannabis as a patient

791
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,160
seeking an alternative to the

792
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:38,009
pharmaceuticals being pushed at me for

793
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,900
chronic pain and fibromyalgia I realized

794
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:42,000
that not only was cannabis a huge help

795
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,190
in controlling my symptoms but I found

796
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,429
cannabis to be wonderfully social too

797
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:49,710
cannabis makes friends so I took my love

798
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:52,110
of jewelry design and blended it with my

799
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,509
newfound passion for cannabis and began

800
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:57,089
hand crafting bracelets earrings and

801
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:59,129
friendship necklaces and then expanded

802
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:01,289
to many clips rolling chaise and other

803
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,020
home furnishings all made in sterling

804

805

were talking about the importance of

824
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,130
making sure you get the dosing right and

825
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:55,500
you know this is true of humans as well

826
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,320
because you can very easily move

827
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,630
somebody from a dose that's going to

828
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,490
help them to an over medicated dose

829
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,520
that's going to have them you know

830
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:07,259
potentially upset for an hour or so and

831
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,670
we never want to do that with animals

832
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:10,710
because they don't know what's going on

833
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:13,920
to them and they trust us to take care

834
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,809
of them the best way that we can but

835
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:19,320
it's hard because most people don't know

836
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:20,579
how to even dose humans properly and so

837
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:23,519
when they're trying to apply the same

838
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:26,490
you know lack of experience to their pet

839
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,529
things can get into trouble real fast

840
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,470
so Gary during the first set you were

841
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:34,410
talking about how dogs have gotten more

842
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:38,610
cb1 receptors and so they they have a

843
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:40,110
faster uptake of cannabinoids and I

844
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:41,729
often explain that to people it's like

845
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:44,699
the difference between taking an edible

846
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,319
versus hitting a joint when you inhale a

847
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,519
joint that goes to your lungs and it

848
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:49,019
goes or immediately in your bloodstream

849
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,960
and it hits you all at once and that's

850
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:54,389
why you feel stoned faster whereas when

851
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,829
you take an edible or a capsule it takes

852
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,480
a longer time to be processed through

853
00:33:55,829 --> 00:34:00,089
your bag and it comes on a little more

854
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,309
slowly well with what you us about

855
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:04,859
earlier about the cb1 receptors and dogs

856
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:07,109
that tells me that we've got to be even

857
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:08,880
more careful than I thought we needed to

858
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:11,789
be so when you're talking to people

859
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,260
about figuring out dosing what do you

860
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:16,168
tell them when they when they're trying

861
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,140
to weigh like how do I know how many CB

862
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:21,359
receptors my pet has got versus dog

863
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,699
weight you know these are these are

864
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,140
unknowns at this point so how do you how

865
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:28,619
do you help bring somebody through it

866
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:30,929
yeah you know I mean the I think the

867
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:32,880
there there's a couple of a couple of

868
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,099
hard and fast rules in this regards and

869
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,280
and you know if I were say speaking with

870
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:41,309
a group of pet owners or educating

871
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,840
veterinarians on on you know ways that

872
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:44,820
they can think about using cannabis and

873
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,890
their practice you know the two things

874
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,370
that I think are important to remember

875
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:54,299
as it pertains to dosing is number one

876
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:56,069
you know it's you know it's all about

877
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,769
body weight it's all about the body

878
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:00,480
weight of the animal so you know it's

879
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:02,400
interesting when you look at when you

880
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,409
look at dosing for humans very commonly

881
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,200
in the literature you'll see you know

882
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:11,399
this drug X number of milligrams per

883
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:14,549
adult human male or human female but

884
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,309
there's so much variability in sizes of

885
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,880
adult dogs I mean you can have a one

886
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:21,570
pound

887
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:25,050
or a 200-pound Great Dane

888
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:27,059
so so knowing how much the patient

889
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:31,320
weighs has got to be step one and step

890
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:33,509
two as as we often say even when it

891
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,030
comes to human medicine it is very much

892
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:38,970
a start low and go slow kind of approach

893
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:42,090
yeah so you know we start them at we

894
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:45,329
start them at a dose that that we know

895
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:47,220
is going to be safe and is very unlikely

896
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:50,610
to cause any sorts of side-effects and

897
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:54,000
then slowly over time we increase that

898
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:56,309
dose until we get to until we either get

899
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,239
to a therapeutic effect that we're

900
00:35:56,309 --> 00:36:01,710
looking for or we've gone so high that

901
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:03,629
we're now seeing side effects that we

902
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,519
don't like in which case we may need to

903
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,559
think about a different medication and

904
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,239
that's why it's important to go slow

905
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:11,909
because that you know if you're gonna go

906
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,199
step step step and like let's say that

907
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:15,599
it's the fourth step where you're

908
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,730
starting to see adverse reaction you

909
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,710
don't want to be taking big steps so

910
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:22,289
that there's a big adverse reaction you

911
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:25,230
want it to be very very subtle so that

912
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:28,019
you can read your animals body language

913
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:31,139
and then realize okay this is this is

914
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:33,000
our threshold point here and so again

915
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:36,420
it's it's important what would you call

916
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,630
a a a small step are you talking about

917
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,190
increases of like a half a milligram

918
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,809
well again I mean you know it's it's

919
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,179
it's hard to say on a per milligram

920
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:47,489
basis because it depends on the size of

921
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:49,949
the animal so you know I might look a

922
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:54,479
little bit more from a percentage

923
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:56,789
increase rather than per milligram you

924
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,809
know so probably you know a safe thing

925
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:01,949
to start with

926
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:05,039
would may be like like a 20% increase on

927
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:07,319
a weekly basis and you know what people

928
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,300
need to kind of look out for is is if if

929
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,600
as they're ramping that dose of if they

930
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,400
give if they give an increased dose and

931
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,019
and the pet looks you know they look a

932
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,190
little glassy I they look a little out

933
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:19,349
of it they're sort of staring off into

934
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:22,530
space then probably that means we need

935
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:23,849
to back off the dose somewhat so Gary

936
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,980
one of the things that you know that

937
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:28,619
that everybody wants to know is the

938
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,630
exact dosage that they need to start

939
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:31,779
with and this is difficult right because

940
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,300
nobody wants to

941
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,010
about it and and when I when I when I

942
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:39,130
read places they don't want to go to

943
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:41,950
that level of detail so you've already

944
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:45,280
spoken real clearly that there are

945
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:47,469
variations between a smaller pet and a

946
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,200
larger pet but but there's got to be

947
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:52,059
some algorithm where we can get people

948
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:55,149
to start because they're gonna do it

949
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:56,529
anyway so so what do you recommend yeah

950
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,349
you know I mean that if that is true and

951
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:01,690
that is that is invariably one of the

952
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:04,239
questions that almost all people who are

953
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,420
looking at cannabis for animals have and

954
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,549
quite rightly so so you know to start

955
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,700
with as it pertains to dosing to start

956
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:14,590
with CBD and and I'll start with that

957
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:17,049
because we actually do have some some

958
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,610
research information here the study that

959
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,440
I was mentioning a little bit earlier

960
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:23,200
that came out of Cornell looking at dogs

961
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,670
with arthritis as well as another study

962
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,949
that came out of Colorado State

963
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:30,340
University looking at dogs with epilepsy

964
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:32,019
so treating seizures with CBD both of

965
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:36,309
those studies looked at dosages

966
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:38,769
approximately of two milligrams of CBD

967
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:42,639
per kilogram of body weight twice daily

968
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:44,800
so you know as a doctor all of our we

969
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:47,170
sort of think in in terms of milligrams

970
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,870
per kilogram when it comes to dosing but

971
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,940
what that really translates to in in

972
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,940
plain English is about a milligram of

973
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,380
CBD per pound of body weight so for

974
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,849
example if you have a ten pound dog

975
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,360
you're talking about give or take about

976
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:03,279
ten milligrams of CBD twice a day now

977
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:07,420
mind you if you're if you're familiar at

978
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:11,590
all with with with with CBD dosing that

979
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:14,680
dose may strike you as high and and and

980
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:16,660
in truth when I saw these studies

981
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:18,730
initially I kind of find that found that

982
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:20,829
dose so seemingly a little on the high

983
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,929
side as well I have seen a lot of

984
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:26,920
animals do very well on much lower

985
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:29,259
dosages of CBD so it may be that that

986
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,930
that even significantly lower dosages

987
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,630
can be beneficial but but as you know

988
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:37,679
you know the the margin of safety for

989
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:40,150
CBD is like a mile wide so so you don't

990
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,219
you you don't have a lot of concern

991
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,260
there from the standpoint of overdose

992
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:45,219
toxicity that sort of thing now clearly

993
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,910
that's

994
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:50,529
not the case when it comes to THC so let

995
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:53,319
me preface this by saying that the

996
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:55,119
dosing that I'm about to discuss is is

997
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,400
unfortunately not based on any

998
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,519
scientific research at this point it's

999
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,700
really a combination of extrapolation

1000
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:05,829
from human research what I have seen

1001
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:07,889
work well in pets reports that I've

1002
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:11,739
gotten from from other veterinarians

1003
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:13,420
from other medical professionals etc but

1004
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:15,909
I think it's I think it's a reasonably

1005
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:19,210
good guideline and the guideline from

1006
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:21,730
the standpoint of starting a THC dose

1007
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:26,199
for a dog or a cat is going to be

1008
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:30,369
approximately point zero five milligrams

1009
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:32,230
per kilogram twice a day so that's 0.05

1010
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:35,019
milligrams per kilogram of body weight

1011
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:38,139
twice a day so again in plain English

1012
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:41,650
what that what that's going to translate

1013
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:45,039
to is about a quarter of a milligram per

1014
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:48,820
10 pounds of body weight so if you have

1015
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,619
for example a 40 pound dog you might

1016
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:54,670
think about starting with a milligram of

1017
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:56,530
THC twice a day and and as we discussed

1018
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,050
you know you can sort of slowly ramp up

1019
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,330
from there but that should be a

1020
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:02,980
reasonably safe place to start so Gary

1021
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:05,469
of course that brings us to how do we

1022
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:08,858
actually get the dose into the animal

1023
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:12,129
you know often I will recommend to pet

1024
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:13,900
owners to use an alcohol-based tincture

1025
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:19,150
because that goes through the skin so

1026
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:21,730
easily and following the the analytics

1027
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,579
on the label to dose them the proper

1028
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,710
amount on the skin under the fur on the

1029
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:28,420
back of the neck and and I've heard some

1030
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,039
people do that same technique but

1031
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,108
they'll do it with the ear because it's

1032
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:34,630
got you know very soft membranes as well

1033
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:38,500
but in your role you are constantly

1034
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:41,050
teaching people how to give their pets

1035
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,838
you know you know capsules or liquids or

1036
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:45,970
whatever they normally need to take so

1037
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:50,019
how do you how do you advise people to

1038
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:52,629
actually get the get the cannabinoids

1039
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:55,619
into the animal which which won't

1040
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:58,010
necessarily recognize it as food sure so

1041
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,460
you know I am

1042
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:04,520
I'm a big proponent of of cannabis

1043
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,230
infused oils and I like them for a

1044
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:07,909
couple of reasons

1045
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,800
the first reason is is whenever you're

1046
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:12,920
administering a liquid you have a lot of

1047
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,720
leeway as far as as far as dosing goes

1048
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,490
so you know as we were discussing

1049
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,159
earlier you know if we're gonna go with

1050
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:21,439
the sort of start low and go slow theory

1051
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:24,529
and we're gonna say okay well you know

1052
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,970
increase by say 20% each week if you're

1053
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,560
gonna do that with a liquid it's quite

1054
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:29,209
easy if you're gonna do it with some

1055
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:31,610
something that looks like a food item

1056
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:34,429
like a dog biscuit or something you know

1057
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,289
20 percent can be tricky you know it's

1058
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:39,379
hard to break those things up into you

1059
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:43,519
know into sort of even portions and I

1060
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:47,840
also do like to give the oils directly

1061
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:49,579
orally with the intent that hopefully

1062
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,610
we're going to get a certain amount of

1063
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:54,079
trans mucosal absorption so absorption

1064
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,750
into the bloodstream directly through

1065
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,579
the mouth

1066
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,440
even prior to that medication being

1067
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:01,460
swallowed and ultimately digested and

1068
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,980
absorbed through the gastrointestinal

1069
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,079
tract so you know I think I think oral

1070
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,170
administration is is is certainly my

1071
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,960
preferred method just to address what

1072
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,119
you were speaking about before what I

1073
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,599
would call transdermal so putting it on

1074
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:20,480
the skin with intent being systemically

1075
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,579
absorbed they don't have an enormous

1076
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,119
amount of information about the efficacy

1077
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:28,219
of that but I can tell you that the the

1078
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:30,130
aforementioned study from Colorado State

1079
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:32,779
University looking at epileptic dogs

1080
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:36,710
also looked at rates of absorption of

1081
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:38,990
various methods of administration of CBD

1082
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:41,949
and they found that the transdermal

1083
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:49,000
absorption was the most poorly absorbed

1084
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:51,829
preparation so so at least preliminarily

1085
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,139
it may be that that you know that

1086
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:56,710
cannabis is not is not super well

1087
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:59,000
absorbed in that way but if nothing else

1088
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:01,539
you know one thing that I can say really

1089
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,800
just from my experience with other

1090
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:05,960
transdermal medications that are used in

1091
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,990
veterinary medicine is at best

1092
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,300
absorption is is unpredictable from one

1093
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:11,568
individual to the next so it's a little

1094
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,150
bit

1095
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:15,798
to tell how much is actually getting in

1096
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:19,999
the patient yeah fair enough

1097
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:21,949
so if you are recommending oral and and

1098
00:44:19,998 --> 00:44:24,679
if I understand your vocabulary

1099
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:26,318
correctly you don't really want it you

1100
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:29,448
know clearly we don't want to do like a

1101
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:31,699
preset dosed biscuit dog biscuit or

1102
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:34,309
something or animal whatever but but we

1103
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:36,709
do want to use an oil but you're also

1104
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:40,039
saying don't take a pre-measured amount

1105
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:42,318
of that oil and apply it to the dog

1106
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:45,170
biscuit you regularly give them I think

1107
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,088
you're saying just put the oil in their

1108
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,068
mouth is that what you're saying I mean

1109
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:50,869
I think in a perfect world yes that's

1110
00:44:49,068 --> 00:44:53,028
what I'm saying now you know I mean

1111
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:56,150
that's all well and good but I mean if

1112
00:44:53,028 --> 00:44:58,400
an animal is just bottom line not

1113
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,528
amenable to being medicated that way

1114
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,838
then by all means feed it to them put it

1115
00:45:00,528 --> 00:45:04,400
on food put it on a treat it's not you

1116
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:07,338
know it's it you know these things are

1117
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,588
not it's not black or white you know I

1118
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:12,949
think if we're looking for the most

1119
00:45:09,588 --> 00:45:15,469
efficient means of absorption directly

1120
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:18,259
or Alize probably a good way to go and

1121
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:19,940
you know and I think that that you know

1122
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:24,440
I think that that speaks a little bit to

1123
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:27,889
the conversation of if you get the right

1124
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,949
preparation for the individual dosing

1125
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:34,808
becomes really easy because let's say

1126
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:37,849
that if I'm going to dose some given dog

1127
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:41,180
and based on the concentration of the

1128
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:44,449
medicine that I have the doses two or

1129
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:47,568
three drops of oil I can put those drops

1130
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:49,940
of oil on my finger and just lift up a

1131
00:45:47,568 --> 00:45:52,699
lip rub it on his gums and I'm done I

1132
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:55,729
see so you know but you know if you can

1133
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:57,528
I shouldn't you have to give like three

1134
00:45:55,728 --> 00:45:58,338
teaspoons of oil then yeah that's gonna

1135
00:45:57,528 --> 00:46:00,679
be a problem

1136
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:03,349
right on and it's always important I

1137
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:05,478
think when when just like interacting

1138
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:08,180
with human patients when you have an

1139
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:11,629
animal patient they have got a life

1140
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:15,259
experience too and and we want to make

1141
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:17,499
sure that we create a healthy experience

1142
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:20,478
for them so they don't want to resist

1143
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:22,009
being handled and medicated and and who

1144
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:23,748
knows you might have an experience like

1145
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:24,840
we talked about earlier where the animal

1146
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:28,829
realizes that

1147
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:32,039
after I get rubbed with this oil on my

1148
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:34,349
gums my pain decreases they may end up

1149
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:37,949
being like all in like I'm in favor of

1150
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:40,529
this you know that that may in fact be

1151
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:42,480
true though the one part we're worried

1152
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:45,120
it may not work out as well as we wanted

1153
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,710
to is is is while dogs and cats are

1154
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,799
certainly very attuned to a

1155
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:52,769
cause-and-effect relationship it may be

1156
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,269
that the effect is far enough down the

1157
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:56,219
road from the cause that they don't

1158
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:59,250
connect the two you know if they don't

1159
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:01,079
feel better for like a half hour they

1160
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,340
may not connect that to when we put it

1161
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,190
in their mouth yeah fair enough fair

1162
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:07,230
enough so let's let's take this to the

1163
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,730
far end of the scale right because they

1164
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:12,389
at the far end of the scale we've got

1165
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:16,159
animals with cancer and fourth up for

1166
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:20,279
folks who do not understand what a

1167
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:23,849
typical human cancer protocol is it's

1168
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:27,810
taking sixty grams or technically

1169
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:30,569
milliliters of of this cannabis oil

1170
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:33,000
commonly known as Rick Simpson oil or

1171
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:34,980
ethanol hash oil but essentially it's a

1172
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,210
it's an ethanol extraction of the oil

1173
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:43,440
from the plant very concentrated and and

1174
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:45,750
a human will take 60 milliliters of this

1175
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,280
over 90 days and that is an

1176
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:51,750
extraordinary amount of cannabinoids and

1177
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,060
just about all the patients find that

1178
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,579
they sleep through the majority of the

1179
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:57,989
time because it's so I could makes you

1180
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:59,309
so lethargic you know there are

1181
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:02,399
certainly people who will be taking

1182
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:04,559
these high dosage and and it actually is

1183
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,389
a buoy to them they're actually feeling

1184
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,099
better and more lighthearted and they

1185
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:10,920
don't sleep but that's that's really

1186
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:14,460
uncommon normally people are lethargic

1187
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,110
and and they sleep most of the time but

1188
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,550
the problem is that when people are

1189
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:20,250
getting up they would when they're

1190
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:22,700
titrating up and going to a higher

1191
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:25,800
higher dose every third or fourth day

1192
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:30,629
sometimes you get nausea from the higher

1193
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:32,789
dose or or like any kind of dysphoria

1194
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:36,570
that people will sometimes have when

1195
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:38,279
they take too much THC and so people

1196
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:42,240
will say okay I know

1197
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:46,740
oh that I that that humans are taking a

1198
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:49,979
THC preparation for cancer and my dog

1199
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:52,349
has got a tumor or some other form of

1200
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,000
cancer and so I want to do that for my

1201
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:56,909
dog too because they have an

1202
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,980
endocannabinoid system and so the

1203
00:48:56,909 --> 00:49:00,899
problem of though is that when you're

1204
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,449
working with a patient the patient is

1205
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,000
giving you very clear feedback about how

1206
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:07,769
they're feeling and we are dealing with

1207
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,380
high dosage so that feedback is

1208
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:14,639
incredibly important when we're doing

1209
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:17,849
this with our you know house pet we are

1210
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,799
way closer to cannabinoid toxicity

1211
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:24,929
levels by trying to do in high enough

1212
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:27,330
dose that is actually acting as a as

1213
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:29,489
they cancer cure because this is way

1214
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:32,130
more of a dose than just helping them

1215
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:35,669
with joint pain but the but the animal

1216
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:38,640
can't give us really quality feedback to

1217
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:40,920
know if they are getting paranoid or

1218
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:43,379
getting upset or getting nauseous or any

1219
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,309
of these things and it makes for a very

1220
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,630
difficult situation and yet I'm

1221
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:51,539
regularly hearing from people who are

1222
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:53,730
buying syringes of ethanol hash oil

1223
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:55,170
putting it in capsules and giving it to

1224
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,869
their animal to try to help with their

1225
00:49:55,170 --> 00:50:00,210
tumors I think that there are so many

1226
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:02,670
ways for this to go wrong what has been

1227
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:04,530
your experience well that is that is an

1228
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:07,440
accurate statement there are so many

1229
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:12,510
ways for this to go badly you know first

1230
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:16,019
of all if anybody you know if anybody

1231
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:19,620
has ever had the experience of eating

1232
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:22,500
too many edibles you know you can start

1233
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:24,029
to get an idea of of what kind of

1234
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,730
effects that we're talking about I mean

1235
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:29,400
you know overindulging on edibles is not

1236
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:31,530
a good time for anybody and if you've

1237
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,130
ever seen a person on one of these

1238
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:37,710
cannabis protocols for cancer I will

1239
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:41,640
tell you that it is brutal yeah it is

1240
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:43,110
not fun for these people but you know

1241
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:45,119
what I mean if it's something that as a

1242
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:47,070
human if that's what you've signed up

1243
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,659
for then you've made that decision and

1244
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,849
you understand why you feel the way that

1245
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:54,078
you do and

1246
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:58,009
that's all great that said we cannot do

1247
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,048
that we can't do that with animals and

1248
00:50:58,009 --> 00:51:01,909
you know I mean you know there's a

1249
00:51:00,048 --> 00:51:05,179
couple of things to say I guess in that

1250
00:51:01,909 --> 00:51:07,699
regards first of all you know justjust

1251
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:11,748
from an from an oncology perspective so

1252
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:12,949
from a cancer treatment perspective you

1253
00:51:11,748 --> 00:51:15,649
know there's a little bit of a different

1254
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:18,170
philosophy when it comes to when it

1255
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:21,588
comes to animals versus people so for

1256
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:24,318
example if a person has cancer and and

1257
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:27,858
they go to their oncologist essentially

1258
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:31,880
their oncologists mission is to keep

1259
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:34,190
their patient alive no matter what and

1260
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,880
sometimes that means damn near poisoning

1261
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:39,949
them to death in the process when it

1262
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,140
comes to veterinary patients when it

1263
00:51:39,949 --> 00:51:45,108
comes to animals nobody wants to put an

1264
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:50,900
animal through that kind of chemotherapy

1265
00:51:45,108 --> 00:51:53,288
and as such the goals of of oncology

1266
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:56,420
when it comes to animals is not to

1267
00:51:53,289 --> 00:51:58,819
preserve life at all costs it is to

1268
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,229
preserve quality of life so I think

1269
00:51:58,818 --> 00:52:03,139
that's the first thing that we have to

1270
00:52:00,228 --> 00:52:05,629
we have to really sort of pay very close

1271
00:52:03,139 --> 00:52:08,808
attention to is is you know what I mean

1272
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:11,059
it's cancer and and just like with

1273
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:12,829
people you know a lot of pets

1274
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:15,469
unfortunately are going to ultimately

1275
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:17,420
succumbed to cancer and the best thing

1276
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:20,208
that we can do for these animals is to

1277
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:22,749
give them good quality of life for as

1278
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:24,948
long as we possibly can so having them

1279
00:52:22,748 --> 00:52:26,598
uncomfortably stoned out of their minds

1280
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:29,719
for the last weeks or months of their

1281
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:33,318
life is is really is really not a good

1282
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:35,568
way to go to speak to the specific

1283
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:36,829
preparations I know there's a lot of

1284
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:39,018
people out there that are buying Rick

1285
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:42,140
Simpson oil and other sorts of super

1286
00:52:39,018 --> 00:52:46,548
concentrated cannabis oils I would

1287
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:49,368
HIGHLY highly advise against giving any

1288
00:52:46,548 --> 00:52:52,068
of those products to animals and the

1289
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:55,548
reason why I say that is because those

1290
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:57,978
products are so concentrated that it is

1291
00:52:55,548 --> 00:53:00,048
functionally impossible to accurately

1292
00:52:57,978 --> 00:53:01,649
dose so we talked a little bit earlier

1293
00:53:00,048 --> 00:53:03,809
about dosing

1294
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:05,670
you know on a on a milligram per

1295
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:07,740
kilogram of body weight basis or a

1296
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:09,269
milligram per pound of body weight basis

1297
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:11,429
you know when you're talking about

1298
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:17,639
something like Rick Simpson oil that is

1299
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:23,429
so concentrated that a grain of right MA

1300
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:26,429
10 20 50 milligrams of of THC and let's

1301
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:29,068
say your dog's dose is one milligram of

1302
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:32,338
THC there's no way you're gonna be able

1303
00:53:29,068 --> 00:53:34,409
to sort of accurately dose that and and

1304
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:37,440
you know again from from a doctor's

1305
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:40,588
perspective a grain of rice is not a

1306
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,088
dose you know yeah you know I mean you

1307
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:44,608
know my you know my immediate thought is

1308
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:46,710
always like what kind of rice is it long

1309
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:49,380
grain is it short grain is it basmati

1310
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:52,470
rice I mean you can't you can't you

1311
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,088
can't dose medicine in this way I mean

1312
00:53:52,469 --> 00:53:56,129
if you're gonna call if you're gonna

1313
00:53:54,088 --> 00:53:58,230
call cannabis powerful medicine which it

1314
00:53:56,130 --> 00:54:00,690
is then we need to treat it in the in

1315
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,818
the same way that we would any other you

1316
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:06,298
know any other powerful and effective

1317
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:09,139
medicine so to kind of just sort of

1318
00:54:06,298 --> 00:54:13,139
bring this in for a landing I guess as

1319
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:18,509
it pertains to dosing cannabis for

1320
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:22,379
cancer oftentimes the goal with these

1321
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:24,900
animals is to ramp them up to the

1322
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:26,548
highest dose that we can get them on and

1323
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,130
have them still feel okay and feel

1324
00:54:26,548 --> 00:54:31,650
functional you know remember that just

1325
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:34,079
like with people dogs will develop a

1326
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:37,798
tolerance to the psychoactivity of THC

1327
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:40,260
over time so over time you can get them

1328
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:41,880
on much much higher doses of THC than

1329
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,980
you will be getting able to give them on

1330
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,950
day one and I will tell you that I have

1331
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:49,980
seen dogs with dogs with cancer on doses

1332
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:52,639
of THC then if I were to take it I would

1333
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:55,528
be under the covers for three days so

1334
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:58,108
you know they can develop a tolerance

1335
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:59,909
just like people can but you got to do

1336
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:01,798
it slowly and you really just don't want

1337
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:04,259
to push it any further than they can

1338
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:06,028
handle right on thank you Gary this is

1339
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,950
this has been a great set I'm really

1340
00:55:06,028 --> 00:55:11,519
glad to be able to get this level of

1341
00:55:07,949 --> 00:55:13,889
specificity on dosing all together and

1342
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:15,268
in one place so it's time for us to take

1343
00:55:13,889 --> 00:55:16,679
our second short break and

1344
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:18,088

00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:28,349
listener of shaping fire you already

1378
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:30,478
understand the importance of living soil

1379
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:32,189
when growing cannabis when you have

1380
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:34,259
active microbe communities in your

1381
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:36,298
substrate you go way beyond simply

1382
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:39,028
fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and

1383
00:56:36,298 --> 00:56:41,038
potassium having active microorganisms

1384
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:42,869
in your substrate supports vigorous

1385
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:44,669
plant growth throughout the plants root

00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:51,809
first organically derived microbial

1389
00:56:49,648 --> 00:56:54,148
inoculant that focuses on your plants

1390
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:56,219
nutrient cycling processes to release

1391
00:56:54,148 --> 00:56:58,348
soil phosphorus and other micronutrients

1392
00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:01,229
from there bound forms making them more

1393
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:02,969
available to the plant increased levels

1394
00:57:01,228 --> 00:57:05,098
of phosphorus will also keep inner nodes

1395
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:07,499
shorter and focus your plants energy on

1396
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:09,509
bud production not only that but the

1397
00:57:07,498 --> 00:57:10,588
microbes act as a defense shield for the

by out competing potentially harmful

1400
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:17,039
pathogenic microbes pretty cool right

1401
00:57:15,148 --> 00:57:19,168
mammoth pee not only unlocks the

1402
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:22,079
nutrients in your soil but it also helps

1403
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:24,028
protect your plant from disease mammoth

1404
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,329
peas beneficial bacteria act like

1405
00:57:24,028 --> 00:57:28,179
microbial reactors continually producing

1406
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:30,550
enzymes

1407
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:32,469
release nutrients mammoth pee was

1408
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:34,690
developed at a u.s. university has been

1409
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:37,058
extensively tested by Colorado growers

1410
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:39,460
and independent laboratories mammoth pee

1411
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:41,650
is proven to increase growth and enhance

1412
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,510
blooming one of the great things about

1413
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,980
supplementing with microorganisms is

1414
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,569
that they won't compete with whatever

1415
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:49,000
fertilizer program you're already

1416
00:57:46,568 --> 00:57:50,619
running simply dose on top of your

1417
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,929
fertilizer schedule for increased

1418
00:57:50,619 --> 00:57:54,608
benefits to learn more and to find out

1419
00:57:52,929 --> 00:57:58,259
where you can buy mammoth pee near you

1420
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:58,259
check out their website at

1421
00:58:00,568 --> 00:59:21,670
www.opm.gov/tribalprograms as far as we

1422
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:23,079
know oh I don't know and in fact you

1423
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:25,119
know the endocannabinoid system is

1424
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:27,099
fascinating in a sense that that you

1425
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,900
know if you look at the the types of

1426
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:31,869
animals that have an endocannabinoid

1427
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:33,639
system evolutionarily speaking you're

1428
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:35,820
going back millions and millions of

1429
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:37,500
years I mean there are there are

1430
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:40,769
marine invertebrates that have an

1431
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:43,500
endocannabinoid system Wow so so so I

1432
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:44,940
mean most complex animals that you can

1433
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,579
think of have some form of an

1434
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:48,780
endocannabinoid system of course you

1435
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:51,360
know that doesn't mean that it works

1436
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:54,540
exactly the same way as it would in a

1437
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:57,510
mammal but but you know from an

1438
00:59:54,539 --> 01:00:00,150
evolutionary standpoint it is it is it

1439
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:01,320
is pretty well ingrained in the animal

1440
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:04,260
kingdom

1441
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:06,450
now to get to your question about about

1442
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:11,130
small furry things like bunnies and

1443
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:14,730
whatnot the reality is is we don't

1444
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:18,840
really know pretty much anything as it

1445
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:21,420
pertains to as it pertains to dosing on

1446
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,640
these sorts of things you know I can

1447
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:27,420
tell you that that you know sort of the

1448
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:29,909
digestive tract and the metabolism you

1449
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:32,550
know of a rabbit or some others you know

1450
01:00:29,909 --> 01:00:34,859
sort of small furry animal like that is

1451
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:38,730
pretty drastically different from that

1452
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:41,190
of our dog or a cat so it it's probably

1453
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:43,699
not applicable to just sort of downsize

1454
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:48,960
the dosing accordingly per body weight

1455
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:51,419
you know as a rule you know a lot of

1456
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,590
these animals are significantly more

1457
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:58,170
sensitive to pharmaceuticals

1458
01:00:54,590 --> 01:01:01,800
then-then-then say would be a dog or a

1459
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:03,950
cat on a per pound basis so odds are the

1460
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:07,620
dosing is actually going to be lower

1461
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:10,679
than people might think you know I think

1462
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:12,960
from a safety perspective you know if

1463
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:14,669
somebody had like an arthritic bunny or

1464
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,280
a bunny that had like back issues or

1465
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:19,889
something they could try a little CBD I

1466
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,790
think quite safely and see if that helps

1467
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:26,359
I'm not aware of any medical issues that

1468
01:01:23,789 --> 01:01:29,279
that have come up as far as that goes

1469
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,019
with regards to something like THC like

1470
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,090
I say I mean there's just there's just

1471
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:36,179
no information out there to even have a

1472
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:38,550
even have a clue about where to start

1473
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:40,559
from a dosing perspective so let's go

1474
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,140
the other direction so I live on an

1475
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,400
island

1476
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:47,409
that is very equestrian heavy and there

1477
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,619
are there are horses everywhere and

1478
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:53,019
people see THC and CBD being used in

1479
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:58,779
other animals and so they're there

1480
01:01:53,019 --> 01:02:00,159
looking to deploy THC for you know for

1481
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,690
injury or everything we've pretty much

1482
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:03,969
discussed talking about using it for

1483
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:07,119
dogs and cats really oh they're starting

1484
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:09,369
to cross apply to horses and people are

1485
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:14,319
starting to experiment with high doses

1486
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:17,589
of CBD to to keep horses calm but these

1487
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:20,410
are huge animals with a pretty

1488
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:22,420
significant different kind of system

1489
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:25,529
right down to how they how they process

1490
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:29,139
their nutrition what our thoughts on on

1491
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:31,840
using THC and CBD Nia and the other

1492
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:34,119
novel cannabinoids on these these larger

1493
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,860
livestock animals yeah that's it that's

1494
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:37,239
a really great question and again I mean

1495
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:40,269
there's there there are people that are

1496
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:43,179
starting to look at those issues I mean

1497
01:02:40,269 --> 01:02:46,599
I can tell you just you know from from a

1498
01:02:43,179 --> 01:02:49,989
pharmacology standpoint horses on a per

1499
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:52,960
pound basis usually take far far less

1500
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:54,789
medication to be effective than say what

1501
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,510
a dog or a cat

1502
01:02:54,789 --> 01:03:01,779
so the dosing is is is very likely a lot

1503
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:04,540
lower than people would think that it

1504
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,830
would be you know I do know that there's

1505
01:03:04,539 --> 01:03:09,929
some people out there that are starting

1506
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:12,690
to look at the use of CBD and horses

1507
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:15,399
again we don't really have any any

1508
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:18,429
published or even very much anecdotal

1509
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:21,579
data out there as far as you know

1510
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:23,230
specific doses go you know certainly one

1511
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:26,889
thing that I would urge extreme caution

1512
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:30,210
with as it pertains to THC and an animal

1513
01:03:26,889 --> 01:03:34,239
like a horse is is you know potentially

1514
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:36,400
causing even mild THC toxicity and a

1515
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:39,789
horse I could I could foresee as being a

1516
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,829
very very concerning thing you know from

1517
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:44,320
the standpoint of you know horses as you

1518
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:48,009
probably aware are fairly fragile

1519
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,870
creatures and you know if a horse would

1520
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:52,220
you know got a little too much THC and

1521
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:54,098
lost their footing and fell I mean that

1522
01:03:52,219 --> 01:03:57,319
literally could be a life-ending event

1523
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:59,450
for a horse so you know that's something

1524
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:01,730
I would certainly urge extreme caution

1525
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:04,189
and if people you know if there's horse

1526
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:05,210
people out there you know they may

1527
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,920
actually have a little bit more

1528
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:09,139
information than I do because because

1529
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:12,260
that's not really so much the world that

1530
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:15,949
I live in but but you know i would i

1531
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:18,200
would definitely urge urge extreme

1532
01:04:15,949 --> 01:04:21,139
caution and taking things very very

1533
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:24,289
slowly and not only could it potentially

1534
01:04:21,139 --> 01:04:27,529
put the the horse or other livestock at

1535
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:29,420
at risk but also i mean we all know how

1536
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:32,180
dangerous a horse can be when it is

1537
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:33,920
spooked or honoré and if it's having

1538
01:04:32,179 --> 01:04:36,710
this experience that it's never had

1539
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,570
before and it's feeling unsafe Wow it

1540
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:41,420
could it could hurt the people around it

1541
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:44,059
and it can hurt itself against against

1542
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:46,340
things that are nearby yeah I agree I

1543
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:48,049
mean it's a you know I'm not I'm not I'm

1544
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,880
not gonna say that it's it's something

1545
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,109
that should never be done because again

1546
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,420
it's a little out of my area of

1547
01:04:51,108 --> 01:04:55,250
expertise but I mean it's something that

1548
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:57,650
that should be done under veterinary

1549
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:59,599
guidance and very very carefully right

1550
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:02,809
on I think that's a good point for us to

1551
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:06,470
say you know we're pulling so much of

1552
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:09,049
our experience from from anecdotes and

1553
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:11,509
from personal experience of people doing

1554
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:13,789
this on the animals that tend to be most

1555
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:16,670
commonly in our lives right dogs and

1556
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:20,358
cats and and as we as we work our way

1557
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:22,909
out to smaller animals like rabbits and

1558
01:05:20,358 --> 01:05:25,639
larger animals like like horses and

1559
01:05:22,909 --> 01:05:29,269
cattle the the number of data points

1560
01:05:25,639 --> 01:05:31,940
that we have even anecdotally get less

1561
01:05:29,269 --> 01:05:33,530
and less and less and so if you're

1562
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:36,260
working with animals at either end of

1563
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:41,359
the scale don't think that you can just

1564
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:43,150
take the the dog or cat dosing algorithm

1565
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,829
and just apply it to these other animals

1566
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:47,869
right yeah you're absolutely right yeah

1567
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:49,549
so let's have let's have a little

1568
01:05:47,869 --> 01:05:52,490
discussion about topicals for these

1569
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:54,980
animals because topicals are nice

1570
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:59,079
because they generally keep the dosing

1571
01:05:54,980 --> 01:06:03,050
pretty low and a certainly CBD

1572
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:04,849
topicals for for you know psoriasis and

1573
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:07,160
dermatitis and these these other types

1574
01:06:04,849 --> 01:06:10,130
of skin issues certainly are great for

1575
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:12,139
animals my question which is pretty

1576
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:16,119
basic is how do you do use a topical

1577
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:18,409
with an animal with fur well it's tricky

1578
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:20,719
you know it's tricky for two reasons the

1579
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:22,730
fur is certainly one of them and you

1580
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,949
know if there was an area of skin that

1581
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:27,289
that you know seemed like it really

1582
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:30,349
warrants a topical then it may be that

1583
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:32,300
that area needs to be shaved because

1584
01:06:30,349 --> 01:06:34,429
otherwise I mean I think you know I

1585
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:37,460
think a topical would be we'd be

1586
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:39,739
difficult I have seen some products out

1587
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:42,289
there that are essentially just alcohol

1588
01:06:39,739 --> 01:06:45,199
extracts that are that are packaged as a

1589
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:47,179
spray so it may be that you know you

1590
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:50,689
might be able to you know get good skin

1591
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:54,940
contact with a spray even without

1592
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:57,110
shaving you know and there are certainly

1593
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:58,760
endocannabinoid receptors in the skin

1594
01:06:57,110 --> 01:07:00,620
and the hair follicles so I mean I think

1595
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,140
there's absolutely medical application

1596
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:04,639
there the flip side of it the other

1597
01:07:03,139 --> 01:07:06,379
thing that we have to be concerned about

1598
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,509
is that you know what anything that you

1599
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:13,720
put on an animal skin is likely to get

1600
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:16,160
licked off and that's a real issue

1601
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:18,519
particularly if you're talking about a

1602
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:20,779
topical product that has THC in it

1603
01:07:18,519 --> 01:07:22,789
because again now we have to think about

1604
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:24,710
well how many milligrams of THC is this

1605
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:26,420
dog ingesting because they're licking

1606
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:28,760
this stuff off and is that a concern

1607
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:32,230
from from a toxicity standpoint so it

1608
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:34,250
may be that if people are using topicals

1609
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:36,139
particularly ones that have THC and

1610
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:38,780
they're gonna have to put like you know

1611
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:41,779
like what we call an e-collar like the

1612
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:44,390
lampshade if you will something on them

1613
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:46,760
to prevent them from turning around and

1614
01:07:44,389 --> 01:07:48,099
looking that stuff off so Gary before we

1615
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,840
move on to talking a little bit about

1616
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:54,289
pet nutrition I do want to point out

1617
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:57,079
that that there's not any quality

1618
01:07:54,289 --> 01:07:59,000
standards that are enforced for for pet

1619
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:01,909
medications and there are a lot of folks

1620
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:05,239
that are in the you know in the green

1621
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:07,849
rush that are bringing cannabinoid

1622
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:09,949
isolate products to the market and as

1623
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:12,469
we've learned with humans it's very

1624
01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:14,569
important to use a whole plant

1625
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:16,909
preparation because these individual

1626
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:20,449
molecules say for example CVD which is

1627
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:22,189
short for cannabidiol a lot of people

1628
01:08:20,449 --> 01:08:25,460
put out products that are just that

1629
01:08:22,189 --> 01:08:27,500
individual molecule in some kind of

1630
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:29,239
vehicle and there then they suggest that

1631
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:32,420
it might work just like all the studies

1632
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:34,599
say and yet the vast majority of the

1633
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:36,859
studies are all focused on whole plant

1634
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,469
preparations meaning you do a whole

1635
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:41,870
plant extraction and you not only have

1636
01:08:39,469 --> 01:08:44,270
the cannabidiol there but you also have

1637
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:47,140
the other novel cannabinoids that the

1638
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:49,910
the can of flavin that and all the other

1639
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:52,060
parts of the cannabis plant that that

1640
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:55,278
are found in the in the trichome oil

1641
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:57,830
they're also and they work together to

1642
01:08:55,279 --> 01:09:00,380
do what's called beyond taraj effect

1643
01:08:57,829 --> 01:09:02,719
they work together as a as a complex

1644
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:05,150
lock that unlocks the endocannabinoids

1645
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,859
system well unfortunately there's a lot

1646
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:08,028
of people who are bringing products in

1647
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:10,910
the market that are just these

1648
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:13,640
individual molecule isolates and so my

1649
01:09:10,909 --> 01:09:15,949
question for you is do you find that

1650
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,838
whole plant preparations are preferred

1651
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:21,289
for animals just like they are for

1652
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:23,119
humans you know that's a it's a really

1653
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:25,189
good question and and you know that is

1654
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:28,699
certainly that is certainly something

1655
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:31,159
that certainly something that comes up a

1656
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:32,599
lot because as you say i mean there's a

1657
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:35,028
lot of people out there that are looking

1658
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:38,509
to make money in the cannabis industry

1659
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:42,230
and and you know certainly CBD isolates

1660
01:09:38,509 --> 01:09:45,020
are certainly one of the things that are

1661
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:46,338
out there you know i in my office I

1662
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:50,060
practice what I would describe as

1663
01:09:46,338 --> 01:09:52,369
integrative medicine meaning that I I

1664
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:54,560
offer both conventional Western care but

1665
01:09:52,369 --> 01:09:56,930
also holistic and natural medicine and

1666
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,489
and we use a lot of herbal preparations

1667
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:01,460
in this office both Western herbs

1668
01:09:58,488 --> 01:10:04,609
Chinese herbs what have you and and as

1669
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:06,319
such I am a very big fan of the

1670
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:09,559
entourage effect and of whole plant

1671
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:12,219
extracts in my experience I find that

1672
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:17,360
those products tend to work better

1673
01:10:12,219 --> 01:10:19,130
usually then then isolated compounds and

1674
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:21,619
I think that this kind of plays out a

1675
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:25,400
little bit if you look at for example if

1676
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:28,579
you look at reports from people who are

1677
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:30,649
who are taking medications like Marinol

1678
01:10:28,579 --> 01:10:33,500
which is synthetic THC so that's

1679
01:10:30,649 --> 01:10:35,859
basically just pure THC isolate that was

1680
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:38,479
uh that was manufactured synthetically

1681
01:10:35,859 --> 01:10:39,979
molecularly speaking it's the same THC

1682
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,559
that you would find in cannabis it's

1683
01:10:39,979 --> 01:10:45,169
just that there's nothing else there and

1684
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,750
very frequently those people will report

1685
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:50,090
that whole plant cannabis tends to work

1686
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:52,310
better for them than just the THC

1687
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:54,110
isolate so I mean I think that I think

1688
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,760
that it bears out that these isolate

1689
01:10:54,109 --> 01:10:59,899
products you know speaking in

1690
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,460
generalities do not work as well as a

1691
01:10:59,899 --> 01:11:04,519
really good quality full-spectrum

1692
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:07,880
extract very good so one thing that's

1693
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:09,740
interesting about folks everybody and

1694
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:13,060
how they acquire endocannabinoid

1695
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:15,649
deficiency we generally suggest that

1696
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:17,930
unless you're predisposed to it people

1697
01:11:15,649 --> 01:11:21,799
generally get endocannabinoid deficient

1698
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:23,420
from from stress and anxiety and poor

1699
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:25,579
sleep and poor nutrition and

1700
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:27,829
environmental toxins and things that

1701
01:11:25,579 --> 01:11:30,559
generally run the body down to a point

1702
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:32,809
that it's not making its own endogenous

1703
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,030
cannabinoids effectively anymore and

1704
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:37,940
then we go and supplement it with phyto

1705
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:41,329
cannabinoids from the plant but I know

1706
01:11:37,939 --> 01:11:42,859
that you are an expert also on on pet

1707
01:11:41,329 --> 01:11:44,899
nutrition and I know we're talking about

1708
01:11:42,859 --> 01:11:47,000
a lot of different animals today right

1709
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:49,809
but but I think that one of the key

1710
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,270
things is that if people put the care

1711
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:56,990
into the proper nutrition of their

1712
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:59,720
animals that even if something goes

1713
01:11:56,989 --> 01:12:01,809
wrong there their body's more likely to

1714
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:05,449
bring their endocannabinoid system back

1715
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:08,150
into balance and and and thus the other

1716
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:12,380
systems back into homeostasis all on its

1717
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:15,229
own so outside of the use of of you know

1718
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:17,060
supplementing with cannabinoids what's a

1719
01:12:15,229 --> 01:12:20,179
perspective that you would offer to

1720
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:22,810
people who care for their animals just

1721
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:24,680
so their nutrition is high enough that

1722
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:26,539
endocannabinoid deficiency is less

1723
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:29,300
likely sure

1724
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:31,189
so just to speak to endocannabinoid

1725
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:34,400
deficiency specifically i mean that is a

1726
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:37,109
that is a very very difficult if not

1727
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:40,079
impossible thing to really prove in

1728
01:12:37,109 --> 01:12:42,809
give an individual so it's a it's a very

1729
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:48,269
difficult thing to it's very difficult

1730
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:50,639
thing to quantify that said you know you

1731
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:52,650
can't have good health without nutrition

1732
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:55,650
you know without without appropriate

1733
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:57,929
nutrition and you know I mean no matter

1734
01:12:55,649 --> 01:12:59,638
no matter what kind of supplements no

1735
01:12:57,929 --> 01:13:00,929
matter what form of cannabis a patient

1736
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:02,520
may be taking if they're not eating

1737
01:13:00,929 --> 01:13:04,350
right then they're probably not going to

1738
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,610
be healthy in that you know I mean

1739
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:07,139
that's that's always the first

1740
01:13:05,609 --> 01:13:10,049
conversation I have with anybody that

1741
01:13:07,139 --> 01:13:13,139
brings their pet into my office is is is

1742
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:15,600
what what ideal nutrition looks like for

1743
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:19,679
their pet because that's got to be the

1744
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:21,810
foundation to everything and so so what

1745
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:24,989
do you is there a general guidance like

1746
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:27,480
what I'm kind of like poking at is do

1747
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:30,089
you recommend that that people give

1748
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:32,669
their animals like whole foods that they

1749
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:36,449
that they you know go to the extents to

1750
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:38,880
to make them meals are is is is an

1751
01:13:36,448 --> 01:13:40,379
animal chow if sufficient I don't

1752
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,029
actually have an opinion on this I'm

1753
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:44,460
just curious along with probably a lot

1754
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:46,408
of the listeners gotcha so so I am very

1755
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:51,868
much a proponent of fresh whole food

1756
01:13:46,408 --> 01:13:54,988
diets so you know the bottom line is is

1757
01:13:51,868 --> 01:13:57,960
that no animal or no person evolved

1758
01:13:54,988 --> 01:13:59,428
eating highly processed foods you know

1759
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,439
so you know our bodies are not

1760
01:13:59,429 --> 01:14:03,029
particularly

1761
01:14:00,439 --> 01:14:07,109
ideally equipped to to eat things out of

1762
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:08,969
a can or out of a bag so so you know my

1763
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:11,939
preference is always to have my patients

1764
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:15,929
eating eating fresh whole food diets now

1765
01:14:11,939 --> 01:14:20,399
whether those diets are raw food versus

1766
01:14:15,929 --> 01:14:22,739
cooked food that they've purchased from

1767
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:25,289
a company that makes it or if they're

1768
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:27,569
making food at home using an

1769
01:14:25,289 --> 01:14:30,210
appropriately balanced recipe you know

1770
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:33,238
any of those things any of those things

1771
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:35,850
are fine but but you know as is the case

1772
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:37,319
with all of us the fresher and the more

1773
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:39,690
Whole Foods they're eating the better

1774
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:41,219
off they're going to be right on so you

1775
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:44,029
know mostly we've been talking about

1776
01:14:41,219 --> 01:14:47,029
using cannabinoids today as

1777
01:14:44,029 --> 01:14:48,710
as a solution something's wrong but what

1778
01:14:47,029 --> 01:14:50,449
do you think about using cannabinoids as

1779
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:53,329
a preventative like your your animal

1780
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:57,050
already is healthy and yet we know that

1781
01:14:53,329 --> 01:14:59,059
THC prevents cancer or long-term and we

1782
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:00,680
know that supplementing the

1783
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:03,860
endocannabinoid system with cannabidiol

1784
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:07,190
is generally good for health what do you

1785
01:15:03,859 --> 01:15:09,589
think about giving supplementation with

1786
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:11,689
cannabinoids even if the patient is not

1787
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:12,890
presenting a problem you know what I

1788
01:15:11,689 --> 01:15:17,000
mean I think what we're really talking

1789
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:19,700
about here is micro dosing and and the

1790
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,279
truth of the matter is is I don't know I

1791
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:25,069
don't know that anybody really knows in

1792
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:26,689
the sense of you know as we've discussed

1793
01:15:25,069 --> 01:15:30,529
I mean we have so little research as far

1794
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:34,879
as as far as use of cannabis to treat

1795
01:15:30,529 --> 01:15:37,069
known disease you know using cannabis as

1796
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,930
a preventative is you know I mean I

1797
01:15:37,069 --> 01:15:41,960
think it's I think it's an intriguing

1798
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:44,060
question but I have I just have nothing

1799
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,840
to offer by way of is that a good thing

1800
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,100
