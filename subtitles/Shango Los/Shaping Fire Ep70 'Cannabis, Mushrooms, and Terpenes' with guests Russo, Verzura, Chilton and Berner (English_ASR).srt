2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,320
humans have been using various plant

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,160
medicines together as

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
blends for as long as there has been

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,399
medicine a root of this

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,240
a twig of that a mushroom maybe add some

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,198
heat and we found that we started to

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,439
heal

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,279
over millennia we refined our process

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,719
and got more adept at interacting with

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,039
the natural world

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,038
in the modern day even people who don't

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,118
consider themselves herbalists are

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,719
becoming quite adept at blending plant

15
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,679
and other medicines together to feel

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,079
better

17
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,960

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,000

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,558
house

22
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,919

i'm your host shango los

48
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,280
today's episode is different from

49
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,200
anything i've offered before i was

50
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
recently invited to san francisco to

51
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,799
moderate a private panel recording on

52
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,719
synergistic medicine

53
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,479
the panel was entitled cannabis

54
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,959
mushrooms and terpenes for optimum

55
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,359
health

56
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,359
and was produced by cookies i did not

57
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,719
choose the panelists or the topic

58
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,399
but cookies reached out because they

59
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,798
loved shaping fire and i was happy to go

60
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,719
to the bay area to participate

61
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,240
when we were done recording i ended up

62
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,078
driving the pacific coast highway down

63
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,959
to southern california alone for a few

64
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,239
days too

65
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,000
it was a pretty nice break from

66
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,519
quarantine here on vashon island and

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
allowed me to travel while interacting

68
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,319
with less than 15 people the entire week

69
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,000
that drive along the pch never fails to

70
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,079
be spectacular so

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
the episode today is the audio from that

72
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,040
panel recording

73
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
i asked cookies if i could publish it as

74
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,318
a shaping fire episode because the

75
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
insights expressed by these speakers

76
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,079
is exceptional and there's a lot to

77
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,080
learn in it because there were multiple

78
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,319
mics used at various locations

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,319
and online and some of us were even

80
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,399
outside to be covered safe

81
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,839
some of the sound quality is variable

82
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,439
all in all it sounds good though so

83
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,719
don't let the audio of my speaker

84
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,280
introductions get you down

85
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,800
it gets better really fast so i hope you

86
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,719
enjoy this departure from the regular

87
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640

to talk about synergistic medicine in

107
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,000
the modern era

108
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,000
people are encouraged to take medical

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
advice only from doctors

110
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,598
and the advice patients are usually

111
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,158
given by most doctors

112
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,518

117
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,878
not always

118
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,759
today's discussion will focus on

119
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,039
cannabis

120
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,079
mushrooms and terpenes and how modern

121
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,519

125

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520
to emerging medicines for minority

175
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,839
neighborhoods that are often left out of

176
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,599
breakthroughs in health care

177
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,959
so welcome to all of you thank you so

178
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,439
much for being here

179
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,519
and so let's get right into it so uh

180
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,600
since we're gonna be focusing on blended

181
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,159
medicines with synergistic components

182
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
today

183
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,320
let's start by establishing their

184
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,799
efficacy in history

185
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,639
so dr russo we're gonna start with you i

186
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,319
know you have studied indigenous and

187
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,000
tribal medicines your whole life

188
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,240
and have spent a good amount of time in

189
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
peru working with indigenous people

190
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,960
there

191
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,478
is there a good basis to believe that

192
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,318
humans have combining

193
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,800
different plant medicines for thousands

194
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,120
of years absolutely

195
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,160
uh certainly among the matcha genga and

196
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,399
all the tribes

197
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,680
in amazonia it's common to mix things

198
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:20,079
particularly the ayahuasca admixtures

199
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,680
uh you necessarily have to have at least

200
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,719
two components

201
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,160
uh you have to get the harmaline

202
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,280
alkaloids

203
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,759
from the banisteriopsis vine

204
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,519
and the dimethyltryptamine from

205
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
psychotrial leaves or or

206
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,959
other donors there are hundreds of

207
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,240
plants in the amazon

208
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,079
that have dimethyltryptamine and there

209
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,199
are many other complex mixtures that

210
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,959
they employ

211
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,960
the prototypes that are probably most

212
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,598
familiar to people though are

213
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,719
traditional chinese medicine where you

214
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,918
might have

215
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,680
several components that attack the

216
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,680
problem itself

217
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,598
but there are a multitude of other

218
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
components that might deal with the side

219
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,719
effects from the main components

220
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,079
so mixtures of the norm as opposed to

221
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
simples meaning

222
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:12,719
one ingredient additionally on

223
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,120
western tradition among the greeks there

224
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,639
were

225
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,478
theriakos which were often again complex

226
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,598
mixtures and you see this

227
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,560
again through uh arabic medicine

228
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,918
uh some of those included cannabis for

229
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,720
example

230
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,079
and then coming up to modern times let's

231
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,240
take a complex

232
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,279
problem like cancer it usually is not

233
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,560
sufficient

234
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:42,159
to attack one aspect of the cancer

235
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,839
rather you have to attack multiple areas

236
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,120
of weakness

237
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,159
so that you get a good tumor kill at the

238
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,280
beginning

239
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,599
so for particularly for something like

240
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,519
leukemia people get a cocktail of

241
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:59,120
medicines

242
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,279
and then we have the example of cannabis

243
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,319
which is a cocktail of medicines in one

244
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,478
plant

245
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,319
between the cannabinoids and terpenoids

246
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,000
and potentially other components like

247
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,280
the flavonoids

248
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,319
but it absolutely makes sense to combine

249
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,279
cannabis with other herbal agents um

250
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,000
and the beauty of it is that our bodies

251
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,038
are really

252
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,879
uh equal to the task they're used to

253
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,878
dealing with these complex mixtures

254
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,080
because a lot of these things

255
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,520
would be components of our foods um

256
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,799
so it it's very much the norm as opposed

257
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,598
to

258
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,038
western medicine where they might

259
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,200
identify a target

260
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,080
in a receptor and computer design a

261
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,000
molecule to

262
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,920
fit there with the highest affinity

263
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
and highest potency but that doesn't

264
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,479
mean it won't be toxic

265
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
with these natural products although

266
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,360
there can be things that are toxic and

267
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,720
too high a dose or even low doses

268
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,759
for the most part our bodies are capable

269
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,440
of metabolizing them and

270
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,120
there's usually very little harm

271
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,240
attached that's great so

272
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,039
so jeff so i know that you have

273
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,639
researched both the the history of

274
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,799
chinese medicines

275
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,919
as well as interacted with the

276
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,399
indigenous folk

277
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,240
in china to learn them firsthand so

278
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,240
you've probably seen these ancient

279
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,120
mushroom blends that come out of china

280
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,120
too

281
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,639
why does chinese medicine blend

282
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,639
mushrooms well you know

283
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,159
i think dr russo was correct i mean

284
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,720
there's there's so many different

285
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,000
aspects to putting these different

286
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,320
formulas together

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,919
and and traditional chinese medicine i

288
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,440
mean it's the perfect example for that i

289
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,479
mean that's what it's kind of based on

290
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,120
they will

291
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,080
the traditional chinese doctor will will

292
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,039
prescribe

293
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,240
he'll diagnose he will prescribe

294
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,120
different herbs

295
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,959
that he believes will will address the

296
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,519
particular illness that

297
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,199
is present regarding mushrooms you know

298
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,759
they've been used for thousands of years

299
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
there

300
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,838
the there's one mushroom in particular

301
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,320
porya cocos which is a

302
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,760
a diuretic and one of the other things

303
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
that that we've found

304
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,958
too and what researchers have found is

305
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,159
that different

306
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,439
mushrooms will have effects on different

307
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,600
tumor systems

308
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,959
so so let's just say you you wanted to

309
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
either

310
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,879
prescribe one for as an adjunct to a

311
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,440
certain

312
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,159
tumor you could do that or in fact you

313
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
could put

314
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,480
them together into one particular

315
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,278
formula

316
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,600
and that would work in in different ways

317
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:35,679
on

318
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,839
on that particular uh illness that

319
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,799
somebody has in terms of cancer so

320
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
they're definitely reasons that you can

321
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,599
blend these together

322
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,360
and and certainly when it comes to

323
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,800
triterpenoids which is something that

324
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,480
we're really looking at

325
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:55,278
there are over 130 tri-terpenoids in

326
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,159
reishi mushroom and they found that

327
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,278
specific

328
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,360
ones will have specific activities so

329
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,200
that's something too that that is pretty

330
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,639
interesting in what you're talking about

331
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,560
i totally agree that that is an

332
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,679
interesting aspect in fact

333
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,199
when we talked um last time i was

334
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,958
actually surprised to find out that

335
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,440
mushrooms had terpenes

336
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,039
as a primarily uh you know cannabis

337
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,800
enthusiast

338
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,360
of course i've talked about and and done

339
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,719
my research in terpenes by the time the

340
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,159
mushrooms get to me

341
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,240
or at least the mushrooms that i usually

342
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,600
participate in they kind of they just

343
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,278
kind of don't seem to have all that much

344
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,159
smell but then when you smell one that

345
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,919
is fresh

346
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,039
you're like oh this is an entirely

347
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,399
different experience

348
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,360
[Music]

349
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,399
indeed and just to be clear not every

350
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
every uh

351
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,078
single species will have triterpenoids

352
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,719
there's a couple of species

353
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,000
in particular that are famous for that

354
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,560
one would be ganoderma

355
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
the reishi mushroom and the other would

356
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,799
be

357
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,959
chaga and and reishi's really packed

358
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,479
with these triterpenoids and that's what

359
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,159
gives it its bitter flavor

360
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,839
but a lot of the mushrooms do not have

361
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,679
those compounds so now that we've kind

362
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,399
of talked about um

363
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,439
how blends have been made throughout

364
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,159
human history

365
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,079
and we realized that actually blending

366
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,199
medicinal properties together

367
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,439
is is more the expectation rather than

368
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,720
separating them out and isolating them

369
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,120
let's talk a little bit about

370
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,959
um what people do when they blend them

371
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,600
so tony i'm coming over to you

372
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,679
as a professional formulator and healer

373
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,759
what attributes do you look for when

374
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,399
designing a healing blend or

375
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,078
formulation from different components i

376
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,320
subscribe to

377
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:37,039
both what they're talking about when it

378
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,800
when you look at eastern versus western

379
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,240
and i think really i think the

380
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,559
difference becomes

381
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,839
in the pharmac pharmaceutical world

382
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,719
they're really keying on

383
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,040
like on a compound an active ingredient

384
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,519
and

385
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,639
many often times they're creating a

386
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,039
synthetic

387
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,560
version of that so if we look at like

388
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,799
what the fda and what the world is

389
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,439
approving in actual medicine

390
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,759
we look at that they're looking at an

391
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,600
active compound or one singular type of

392
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,600
molecule that they're isolating

393
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,800
and they're utilizing that you know to

394
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,959
go through their research

395
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,919
and like you guys were talking about

396
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,919
they're you're

397
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,278
kind of addressing one issue but then

398
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,559
you might actually have a side effect to

399
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,879
another issue

400
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,000
and so when you're looking at um

401
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,679
synergistic

402
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,078
properties of all herbal medicine and

403
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,159
you look at what's called grass approved

404
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,479
that's what ethan khan was talking about

405
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,439
and these things are

406
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,879
made in earth they're made naturally and

407
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
so when you put them into your body

408
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,159
we're also from the earth

409
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,120
and so if we put things into our body

410
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,198
that is uh you know synthetically made

411
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,799
it doesn't it leaves a footprint right

412
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,679
and even it's like plaque

413
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,399
so if we were to you know start printing

414
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,319
3d

415
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,600
cannabis you know it's like oh well we

416
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,000
know what's in cannabis we got the

417
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,240
cannabinoids the terpenes the flavonoids

418
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,278
um we put a computer together and we

419
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,720
start printing

420
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,399
that herb you're never going to ever

421
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,160
ever capture

422
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,759
all of those compounds that are

423
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,000
naturally produced on earth and as we

424
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,838
put

425
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,278
those things into our body then it

426
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,199
leaves footprints and then we don't have

427
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,000
a sustainable

428
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,519
and a very synergistic type of approach

429
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,278
to what we're doing as a medicine

430
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,278
and so i think when you look at the

431
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,480
world of healers in the world of

432
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,838
pharmaceutical compoundist they have a

433
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,360
completely different approach

434
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,279
and so there's a chemist and there's an

435
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,919
alchemist and so i don't really

436
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,120
subscribe

437
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,278
to um and i think there is a place for

438
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,720
chemistry and i think it has a wonderful

439
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,600
place in the science world

440
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,199
but for me personally i'm trying to like

441
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,879
figure out a way to

442
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,240
naturally capture what's available in

443
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,278
the plant

444
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,360
and remove impurities that we

445
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,120
that are maybe in the plant that we

446
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,600
don't want to particularly have

447
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,959
and so that way we can actually do what

448
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,759
the western world is trying to

449
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,159
accomplish

450
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,078
but in a plant-based effectiveness and

451
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,639
so if i look at the plant of cannabis

452
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:56,638
and

453
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,320
burner gives me a particular type of

454
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,759
strain i'm going to look at the

455
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,839
statistics of it right i'm looking at

456
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,639
the compounds and say okay this has

457
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,079
thca cbga cbca

458
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,759
you know different kinds of actual

459
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,519
available phytocannabinoids

460
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,198
and then look at the terpene profiles

461
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,720
and we're looking at you know

462
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,240
upwards to 300 compounds and in between

463
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,680
that there's also those

464
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,919
other oils like we were talking about

465
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,239
the flavonoids

466
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,319
that also play into these oils and so

467
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,240
the terpenoids or terpenes of

468
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,320
mainstream cannabis viewers see it or

469
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
even terps

470
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
that's where you know when i first

471
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,839
started calling that everyone was upset

472
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,479
because it's terpenoids or terpenes i'm

473
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
like well

474
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
it's easy for the most people to

475
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,360
understand them as terps but

476
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,600
those are really not just the aroma uh

477
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,120
not just the flavor but they're really

478
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,519
the catalyst and the effect

479
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,759
behind all of that and our friend on the

480
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,440
panel here inspired me by the way

481
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,919
in taming thc i think it was 2007

482
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,360
when he wrote that um you know

483
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,958
everything i've done

484
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,399
has come from those that came before me

485
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:08,239
that laid the ideology down in front of

486
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,639
us that said hey

487
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,799
here's a concept the human body can have

488
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,399
an endocannabinoid deficiency

489
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,159
and that means that we're working off

490
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,278
receptor base in our body

491
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:21,120
our mind our body and our soul has a

492
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,360
synergistic

493
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,879
spirit if you will we're here and so how

494
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,000
do we interact with those

495
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:30,000
and so we want to be able to target that

496
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,679
receptor system as a formulator

497
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,278
and try to pull out all the really good

498
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,439
parts in uh

499
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,958
everything we're talking about to then

500
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
overlay that

501
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,479
similar to probably like how he makes

502
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,078
music right everyone thinks that you

503
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,560
probably have four tracks

504
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,758
probably hundreds hundreds of tracks to

505
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,758
make sounds

506
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,680
and have this whole thing come together

507
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,399
in the same way a beat or song's laid

508
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,439
down

509
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,480
i look at it the same way as how how am

510
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,880
i going to take

511
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,079
the worlds of what's available in this

512
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,600
cannabis plant

513
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,439
what's available in the mushrooms that

514
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,839
he's talking about and how do we create

515
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,120
this overlay to create that synergistic

516
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,480
natural compound

517
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:11,119
and reaction that we think

518
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,798
is going to do x y and z and it probably

519
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,399
will do x y and z but there's probably

520
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,759
other beneficial things

521
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,919
that's tapping into a different

522
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,720
consciousness there wow there's a lot of

523
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,520
good stuff there

524
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,318
um the first thing for anybody who has

525
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,879
not read it

526
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,078
i do recommend that you check out dr

527
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,440
russo's

528
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,319
taming thc paper that tony just referred

529
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,320
to

530
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,519
for many of us it was the thing that

531
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,200
opened our doors

532
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,359
to terpenes and understanding how they

533
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,200
interact with our endocannabinoid system

534
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,959
and um it's old enough now that it's

535
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,640
free online so uh you just want to

536
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,319
search

537
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,960
tamingthc and dr ethan russo and you'll

538
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,038
find it

539
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,400
and it's it's actually very readable

540
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,798
paper even though it's

541
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,480
also very legit science the other thing

542
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:53,119
that you said tony that i want to follow

543
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,919
up on is

544
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,719
i like this elegant uh delineation that

545
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,480
you make

546
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,440
between um chemistry and alchemy

547
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
whereas one um you're you're trying to

548
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,320
reduce

549
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,279
things and spread them apart and break

550
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,240
them apart

551
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,798
whereas with alchemy you're trying to

552
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,720
bring

553
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,160
essential essences together and um

554
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,000
they sound like they could be very

555
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,440
similar but they're certainly different

556
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,679
in intention

557
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,279
and and then as we look at different

558
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,440
extraction technologies

559
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,960
and separation technologies like

560
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,160
solventless

561
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,480
we also learned that um the the effect

562
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
of the the final medicine is drastically

563
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,120
different right

564
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,399
um uh is there i can't i can't really

565
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,279
imagine what would be

566
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,720
a rule of thumb but i figured i'll ask

567
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,279
you for it is there any

568
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,480
any like uh borderline or delineation

569
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,440
that you come up against where you're

570
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,079
like oh

571
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,200
i'm i'm drifting from alchemy into

572
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,720
chemistry

573
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
and that's not the direction i want to

574
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,079
go how do you know if you're if you're

575
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,759
thinking too chemistry-minded

576
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,359
well i don't have a chemistry degree so

577
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,480
i don't i don't i don't know how to use

578
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,678
chemicals

579
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,200
so i guess that's uh everyone you know

580
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,880
gets to that roadblock it's like i have

581
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,240
no choice you know

582
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,679
um so i just don't you know i feel like

583
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,880
i have

584
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,960
counter partners in the industry

585
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,360
that there's a few individuals out there

586
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,840
that seem to be following in the same

587
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,719
path that i and where i'm at where it's

588
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,279
like how do we

589
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
how do we break this thing down uh but

590
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,480
retain what's there

591
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,720
and so i do feel there are people out

592
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,480
there that use chemistry

593
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,160
and from a molecular standpoint um

594
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,519
we get into these debates all the time

595
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,120
so it's like hey if i've got this

596
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,480
solventless thca

597
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,199
that tests 99 and someone says well i

598
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
have this

599
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,319
chemical thc that tests 99 there's no

600
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,559
residuals left there's no

601
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:55,759
footprint left is this the same thing

602
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,960
the answer is in short it is you know it

603
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,000
is the same thing

604
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,880
um but how we get there uh is

605
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,558
is important i think and what's and and

606
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,480
ultimately how

607
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,240
we're utilizing that and what we're

608
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,919
doing to get to that so does it have an

609
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,279
environmental impact

610
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,120
right and so that's something that i

611
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,720
look at and a lot of people don't

612
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,119
really understand so if i'm using a

613
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,839
chemical to extract something from a

614
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,158
plant

615
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,759
what happens to that plant what's the

616
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,520
what's left in that plant for that

617
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,400
particular chemical is it reintroduced

618
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,918
into earth

619
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,919
or are we being able to capture

620
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,919
everything from that actual plant

621
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,679
and use everything in every part of it

622
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,520
and i think that maybe is where you're

623
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,440
going with this because alchemy is

624
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,279
how do i use i think we kind of had a

625
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,360
conversation once about this how do we

626
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,599
how do we use everything from that

627
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,319
flower without

628
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,038
creating pollution or an environmental

629
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,359
effect

630
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,119
we want to break this apart but every

631
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,879
part has a use

632
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,678
right we don't want to just focus on hey

633
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,080
i want this thc from this cannabis plant

634
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,080
let's throw the rest away and if i used

635
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,879
ethanol or i used butane or something

636
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,399
like that

637
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,720
now we've kind of created the next

638
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,519
problem which comes back to like this

639
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
medicine so

640
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,519
what is it what does it take to make

641
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,759
that synthetic opioid

642
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,200
in the process of making that just to

643
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,839
make that particular pill or that

644
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,519
fentanyl

645
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,519
right so they've done a great job making

646
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,158
the synthetic but then what did they do

647
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,440
in the process

648
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,360
of making that and what kind of

649
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,960
environmental impact so i think

650
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,399
it doesn't just come down to a chemical

651
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,159
versus mechanical

652
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,400
it comes down to a consciousness of what

653
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,880
you're what you're making

654
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,159
and then how do we make both the impact

655
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,400
on the human and on us

656
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,840
on this planet i don't know cool thanks

657
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,159
for breaking that out

658
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,319
so berner um you've spent a lot of time

659
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,640
with what i'll call citizen scientists

660
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,960
right

661
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
people who may or may not have the

662
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,759
degrees but they

663
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:48,960
are experimenting with good intention

664
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,279
to make either medicinal or recreational

665
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,798
and

666
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,399
you know that's a pretty blurry line too

667
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:53,200
but but you work a lot with citizen

668
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,360
scientists

669
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,200
cannabis breeders and psychonauts too

670
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,038
who experiment with the body

671
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,480
by ingesting you know all sorts of

672
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,400
things and substances right

673
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,240
what do you and other citizen

674
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,519
researchers look for

675
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,400
when combining healing or recreational

676
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,839
drugs

677
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,360
i mean i think it's important for people

678
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,879
to understand that even if they're going

679
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,279
into a recreational store to buy

680
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,960
cannabis and smoking is still a medicine

681
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,399
i think that's the biggest message we

682
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,000
try to get across is that

683
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,400
this is something that helps in so many

684
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,679
different ways so as you may be smoking

685
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,960
weed and a lot of people a lot of

686
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,720
friends i've met a lot of people that

687
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,000
that i've hung out with along the way

688
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,279
they don't really realize that they're

689
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,558
using it as a medicine

690
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,759
to them they're just getting high

691
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,359
they're kind of healing their pain

692
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,000
they're enjoying the taste but

693
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,279
so much of that that that plant medicine

694
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,960
is important for a lot of us

695
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,038
it unifies people it brings people

696
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,519
together and furthermore it helps a lot

697
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:43,519
more than

698
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,639
some of the pharmaceutical uh medicines

699
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,918
out there so

700
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
you know i think i think it's pretty

701
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,799
interesting because we have a voice and

702
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,119
a platform to educate

703
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:51,839
um that this is a medicine and that's

704
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,158
why

705
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,038
you know i was in the proposition 215

706
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,320
days and

707
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,400
you know i've been doing this legally

708
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,439
since i was 18 i personally saw

709
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,038
firsthand

710
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,798
off-duty cops coming in and buying

711
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,640
cannabis and

712
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,000
lawyers and teachers and it made me

713
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,679
really realize that

714
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,119
you know when it went wreck that we

715
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,280
shouldn't lose that we shouldn't lose

716
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,839
that message that this is a medicine

717
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,279
and you know where i where i grew up

718
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,119
working that there was a

719
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,639
lounge there so essentially people would

720
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,079
be able to come in and buy the herb and

721
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,720
they'd build a blaze and

722
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,079
just that that releasing of the mental

723
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,880
anguish so if someone was coming from

724
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:26,319
the va

725
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
and they've had a really bad time and

726
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,200
they just wanted to come in there not

727
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,199
just in medicine but

728
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,319
the way that people bond around the herb

729
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,759
is super

730
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,519
super healthy is good for the mind it's

731
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,038
good for people in general so

732
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,400
you know i feel like the people i'm

733
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,279
around and the people i'm trying to

734
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,038
educate is that

735
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,720
no matter if it's recreational or not no

736
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,079
matter if you enjoy smoking butter not

737
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,200
it still is a medicine

738
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,519
whether it's helping you with anxiety uh

739
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
depression you're celebrating you're

740
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,400
mourning

741
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,679
you're helping with your appetite um i

742
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,519
think that it's important to kind of get

743
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,080
that message across that this is still a

744
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,240
medicine

745
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,519
whether it be recreational or not yeah i

746
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,759
think that's a good point a lot of us

747
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,158
don't even realize sometimes that we're

748
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,440
we are taking it for medicinal reasons

749
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,520
even though in our head

750
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,038
we're doing it for recreational right

751
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,558
well yeah you may you may think that

752
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:11,679
you're smoking herb because you like the

753
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,200
way it tastes and

754
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,960
you know it puts a smile on your face

755
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,759
but there you go it puts a smile on your

756
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,200
face and

757
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:18,720
you know happiness is everything

758
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,159
especially during kobe and what's going

759
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,919
on in the world right now we need more

760
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,640
smiles we need more good vibes and good

761
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,480
energy

762
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,960
more unity people need to love people

763
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,960
more and that's just kind of what we do

764
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,038
why we do what we do i mean heck if at

765
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,440
this very basis being in a good mood and

766
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,640
being

767
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,200
joyful boosts our immune system and so

768
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,799
if if um you know using cannabis can

769
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,720
help get us there well

770
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,639
let's go for it right absolutely the

771
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,000
price of peace of mind right

772
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,240
that's medicine um and a quick story

773
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,038
i was in colorado once and i was in the

774
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,159
medical

775
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:54,158
world and it turned into the wreck and

776
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,480
you said it was kind of a gray line

777
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,919
and i was i was really down because i

778
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,278
spent a lot of time there i spent a lot

779
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,120
of time with patients and trying to help

780
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,278
people and i too was behind

781
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,959
the bar every single day if you will and

782
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,319
getting to know people and i saw people

783
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,558
coming in and we

784
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,798
helped a lot of people when it went to

785
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:13,678
recreational kind of got down

786
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,400
and i actually came out to the bay area

787
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,720
and

788
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
i always looked up to you and what you

789
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
guys were doing and

790
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,480
he started with you know one one spot

791
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,760
and i came out i was like oh man cookies

792
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,599
is still keeping it real they're still

793
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,480
with the people and the patients

794
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,359
and so i left that that whole entire

795
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,960
industry

796
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,639
for nothing behind me because of an

797
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,240
adult use and i was thinking i had that

798
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,120
chip on my shoulders recreational you

799
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,200
know

800
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,038
and then it just had that awakening i'm

801
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,720
in the bay and the community here

802
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:45,359
and the people uh that were behind it

803
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,159
it has something you know it's not just

804
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,158
the plant

805
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,760
it's how it brings people together and

806
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,919
then how we take care of each other

807
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,038
and there's a certain uh community that

808
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,480
comes behind it

809
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,079
and so i started to have a much

810
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,720
different approach to it

811
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,079
and realized exactly what what berner is

812
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,440
saying is that

813
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,678
i don't even like the word any more

814
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,038
recreational it's just responsible adult

815
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,440
use and now it's full

816
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,119
access for anyone that's 21 and up now

817
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,720
we don't have to have an excuse to say

818
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,519
you need to go see a doctor before we

819
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,200
can come

820
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,798
talk to you about getting whatever herb

821
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
makes you feel good because it is a

822
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:17,679
nerve and it is

823
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,359
medicine so well if you look at the

824
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,480
diversity of this conversation right

825
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,079
here we all have

826
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,079
different we all come from different

827
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,199
walks of life but we're united on this

828
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,480
conversation

829
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,880
i probably wouldn't be speaking to you

830
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,720
if it wasn't for cannabis vice versa

831
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,320
these gentlemen are super educated and

832
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,519
been doing this for a long time but

833
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,879
we're all coming together in this

834
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,079
conversation because of cannabis and

835
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
that's why i still do it

836
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,000
if there is this this sometimes not so

837
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,798
subtle mindset

838
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,240
uh from the from the medical days where

839
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,079
a lot of people honestly were kind of

840
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,038
sketched about going into some of those

841
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,678
stores

842
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,319
but once you were inside it was a very

843
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,360
loving

844
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:56,480
homey huggy good environment right

845
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,278
and then nowadays um the adult youth

846
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
stores are

847
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,159
very you know they've got a lot more

848
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,240
money behind them right so they're

849
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,400
they're very they're very shiny

850
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,240
and people are being programmed more for

851
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,840
the recreational mindset

852
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,240
by um by you know media

853
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,959
and yet they can still get a huge

854
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,798
variety

855
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,600
of quality flowers often and so it's got

856
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,720
a good

857
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,079
existence as well what do you see that

858
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,360
may have

859
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:28,639
been lost in the transition from

860
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,839
medical dispensaries kind of more grungy

861
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,880
lovey days

862
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,558
to this cleaner but maybe more

863
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,399
commoditized environment

864
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,079
that that we might want to encourage to

865
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,599
bring back yeah so

866
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,439
when when you used to come into a

867
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,359
medical dispensary it was like cheers

868
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,038
it was like taxi cab confessions people

869
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,479
would come in you'd be able to show them

870
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,919
the herb out the jar

871
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,599
if they they could smell it they could

872
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,880
pick it up it was way more personable

873
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,000
you can get to know what they like you

874
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,760
can recommend things

875
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,359
i might even give someone a bong here

876
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,480
let them taste it for their purchase

877
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,839
so if you look at the way that we're

878
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,798
doing cookies right now i encourage

879
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,278
people to do this

880
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,319
if you step into my store i still agree

881
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:03,759
to right away

882
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,678
and i have an ipad and they walk with

883
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,879
you to the flower menu and they're kind

884
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,200
of going through and talking to you

885
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,720
about

886
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,319
each and everything that you want to

887
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
know about they're educating you they're

888
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,759
giving their personal opinions and from

889
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,720
there when that customer is done with

890
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,960
that blood tender

891
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,798
then they go to get checked out so point

892
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,319
being is the personal experience

893
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:21,839
hands-on you come to some of these

894
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,439
flashy dispensaries

895
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,879
it's just a menu on the wall and you

896
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,240
kind of get in line and you kind of just

897
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,600
put your order and you bounce it's not

898
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,640
as personable

899
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,158
you know what we're doing with the

900
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
cookie store is we kind of created a

901
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,240
huddle

902
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,240
i believe a lot of good things happen in

903
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,759
the huddle so you got the flower table

904
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,839
is round and people are sitting around

905
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,119
that flower table and just like this i'm

906
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,000
smelling something you're seeing my

907
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,439
reaction

908
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,599
i'm seeing your reaction we may have a

909
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,519
conversation the personable

910
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,879
experience with people working with

911
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,240
people still there and that's what we're

912
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,559
doing with our dispensaries

913
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,519
and so i encourage people when you open

914
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,759
a dispensary

915
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,200
keep the customer in mind you know like

916
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,720
i said you know someone may be coming

917
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,319
from the va they may be coming from the

918
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,440
hospital they might have a terrible day

919
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,720
you want to give them your full

920
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,558
attention and kind of make it more

921
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,360
personable not so in and out you know

922
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,960
and so

923
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,398
that's why we chose the dispensary set

924
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,000
up the way we do we kind of keep that

925
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,918
good personable

926
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,079
interaction in place i think it's very

927
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,960
important yeah i would say that

928
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,798
because i've gone through that

929
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
experience right and now that you say

930
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,918
that

931
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,519
i do see that being the difference in

932
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,480
what's going on in those stores and now

933
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,319
i see

934
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,000
how you took that from the medical side

935
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,599
because you're right

936
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,200
there are a lot of stores out there they

937
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,480
just got their counters

938
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,720
and and before when it was medical um

939
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,159
it was that cheers kind of thing but i

940
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,839
can tell you that

941
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,440
being behind the bar at times where it

942
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,879
was just a couple registers

943
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,519
and you wanted to rap with someone and

944
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,679
talk to him everyone else had to wait

945
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,200
and that actually wasn't the most

946
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,640
efficient way to help someone

947
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,480
but now looking at thinking about what

948
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,679
you just said and you're right because i

949
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,278
came into the store and i'm like oh this

950
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,240
is kind of neat because this person did

951
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:53,599
come with me and i'm like i don't know

952
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,798
what flowers i need to come i came in

953
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,480
with my wife right

954
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,158
and she loves all the cookies flowers

955
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,278
she's like oh she's very particular she

956
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,720
wants to smell everything she wants to

957
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,159
know about everything she wants to know

958
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,319
everything there is

959
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,760
and i realized that that first

960
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,038
experience was like oh this is very

961
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,519
personal in the sense that

962
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,879
we had someone that catered to us and we

963
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,759
were looking at everything

964
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,440
and they didn't they weren't

965
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,558
transactional they weren't there for the

966
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,480
transaction

967
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,839
they were there for the education and

968
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,319
then it was like okay then you get in

969
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,798
line

970
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,158
so i do think he's got the right vibe

971
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,519
there and the right mentality in the

972
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,919
sense that that's how

973
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,679
the store looks amazing and you're right

974
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,360
it is it's got a lot more

975
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,679
bells and whistles behind it and there's

976
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,000
a lot more uh products there

977
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,278
but you know there's there's that touch

978
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,839
and for for us

979
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,119
i have a duality right so a lot of

980
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,079
people know me as

981
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,558
as blue river and i look at that as my

982
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,918
you know

983
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:47,278
top shelf uh extracts that it's like how

984
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,960
far can i push the world in the

985
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,880
boundaries of solventless

986
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,240
to me that was always like my the

987
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,039
products that we'd inhale

988
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,759
it was my my push for what can i do in

989
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,158
the adult

990
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,839
use world and then everyone that says to

991
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,440
me oh well the product's so expensive on

992
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,439
the patient blah blah blah

993
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,798
that's where the this other product line

994
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,120
that i created with invasive wellness

995
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,720
was capsules sublinguals topicals

996
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,839
you know creating cbn and these

997
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,200
different things because i'm like well

998
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,119
if you're really hurting

999
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,480
and you want something affordable let's

1000
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,158
switch you over to a different delivery

1001
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,599
method with a different price point

1002
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,799
and they do carry both wide ranges of

1003
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,158
these products so

1004
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,079
i think that you know if you're opening

1005
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,760
a dispensary it's not just about the

1006
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,678
flowers or the extracts

1007
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,440
but make sure you also still carry the

1008
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,360
medicinal products too because there are

1009
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,120
people that are looking for them

1010
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,479
amen um you know i hadn't thought about

1011
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,119
that about how the cookie stores are

1012
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,519
designed

1013
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,000
i experienced that at your at the

1014
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,120
cookies uh geodesic dome at emerald cup

1015
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,759
last year

1016
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,518
i just generally liked how you go in one

1017
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,960
side and out the other side but inside

1018
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,720
there's all these like little kiosks

1019
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
where people can mill around and learn

1020
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,360
and ask questions and

1021
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,278
that was pretty cool they create a

1022
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,558
conversation yeah when you know people

1023
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,159
that like herbs or

1024
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,000
like to smoke they want to they want to

1025
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,320
understand other people's experiences

1026
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,480
and

1027
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,319
that conversation is priceless that's in

1028
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,079
2 15 days that's what we know

1029
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,519
that's what i loved about my job is

1030
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,678
talking to people even the jar

1031
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,200
if you see the jars that we design it's

1032
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,960
so you can pick it up you can look at it

1033
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,640
you can twist it you can smell it

1034
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,319
even though you can't do a deli style at

1035
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,399
a big jar anymore we created a jar

1036
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,918
custom for our store so people actually

1037
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,319
see what they're they can actually see

1038
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,159
it

1039
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,839
clearly they can smell it they can still

1040
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,559
be hands on a little bit you know

1041
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,558
clutch yeah totally when i saw that i i

1042
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,000
really missed the days of the mason jars

1043
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,558
and sticking your nose in it and we're

1044
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
probably away from those days forever

1045
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:32,960
but um

1046
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,000
we got to be creative about new ways for

1047
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
people to be able to shop with their

1048
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,159
nose again

1049
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,759
well you and real quick you remember

1050
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,519
that like i used to open those big jars

1051
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,000
we'd shake them up and kind of like

1052
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,960
so if you think about what that just did

1053
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,798
was that

1054
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,640
i don't want to sell the product from

1055
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,558
that jar that i've opened all day long

1056
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,240
with all the broken trunks

1057
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,759
especially what's going on right now

1058
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,558
it's like you want to get your like look

1059
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,240
at the sample

1060
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,480
but let me buy something brand new and

1061
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,679
sealed and so that's also another really

1062
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,278
good touch

1063
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,038
that you guys do that i think is

1064
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,558
different thank you we're going to take

1065
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:06,158
a short break and be right back

1097
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,679
particular about the inputs you use for

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,200
and when we go to purchase those

1105
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,119
nutrients we want to be sure that our

1106
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,000
supplier shares our values

1107
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,960

doesn't just stock his store with what's

1121
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,920
available

1122
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,040

product for quality

1124
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,639
and determine that there isn't a better

1125
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,760
version of the product that he could be

1126

at buildasoil.com

1149
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,960
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1150
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,800
growing is so valued by farmers

1151
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,880
is because the mycelium networks in the

1152
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,680
soil remain established from year to

1153
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,440
year

1154
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,598
and we know these fungal networks are

1155
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,760
essential because they are the nutrient

1156
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,000
super highways that extend far and wide

1157
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,400
in the substrate to feed your plants

1158
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
the trouble with growing in new soils or

1159
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,760
blended cocoa substrates

1160
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,838
is that it takes most of the plant's

1161
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,119
life just to create these mycelium

1162
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,159
highways

1163
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,480
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1164
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,000
reduces that time and gets your plant

1165
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,800
eating a wider array of

1166
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,639
nutrients faster and it's three times

1167
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,760
the concentration of the current leading

1168
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,879
brand in the u.s

1169
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,800
at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal

1170
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,640
species selected specifically for

1171
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,119
cannabis cultivation

1172
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,799
this new product called dynomico is the

1173
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,800
result of 30 years of research and

1174
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,640
trials at the volcani agriculture

1175
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,880
research institute in israel

1176
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,400
it has also been vigorously trialled by

1177
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,160
cannabis and food growers

1178
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,400
across the u.s since the product first

1179
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,559
arrived here last year you may have

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,440
already even heard about dynamico by its

1181
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,799
original name

1182
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,720
dynamic now dynomico is available at

1183
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,800
grow shops and online in the united

1184
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:07,118
states for the first time

1185
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,800
i love using dynomyco to both speed up

1186
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,358
the growth of mycelium networks in the

1187
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,000
soil

1188
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,719
but also as a biostimulant to make clone

1189
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,280
cuttings more

1190
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,799
virile you can see side by sides showing

1191
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,599
the comparative growth on their

1192
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,880
instagram

1193
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,880
at dinomyco if you demand reliable

1194
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,559
growing results and appreciate the

1195
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,000
importance of an active root zone in

1196
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,400
creating a thriving plant

1197
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,639
i encourage you to check out dynamico at

1209
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,039
los and our guests this week are dr

1210
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,920
ethan russo

1211
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,920
tony verzura jeff chilton and burner

1212
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,159
let's return to the panel discussion now

1213
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,400
so jeff the medicinal and psychedelic

1214
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,480
mushrooms are becoming increasingly

1215
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,519
popular in the u.s and throughout the

1216
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,358
world right

1217
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,800
um and you can buy tincture in

1218
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,559
concoctions like nearly

1219
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,400
everywhere including like some gas

1220
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,960
stations even right it's so strange to

1221
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,358
see

1222
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,800
medicinal non-psychedelic mushrooms at a

1223
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,199
gas station

1224
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,920
because of that there's a wide variety

1225
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,559
of qualities and price points of

1226
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,559
medicinal mushrooms now even though we

1227
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,559
know that they've got varying amounts of

1228
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,960
medicinal qualities to them what

1229
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:37,759
attributes do we want our

1230
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,720
medicinal non-psychedelic mushrooms to

1231
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,880
exhibit

1232
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,799
so we know they will be potent and have

1233
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,559
a positive effect on our lives

1234
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,160
well you know one of the biggest issues

1235
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,759
in the in this category

1236
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:49,920
right now is the fact that a lot of the

1237
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,160
products out there are not actually

1238
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,000
even mushroom and you know this speaks

1239
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,799
to to you know you know like with

1240
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,519
with cannabis for example there are

1241
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,400
multiple

1242
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,079
parts of this plant so you've got the

1243
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,358
roots you've got the leaves you've got

1244
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,599
the flowers

1245
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,759
and each one of those is going to have a

1246
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,720
certain chemical profile

1247
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,280
now it's no different with mushrooms and

1248
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,879
and

1249
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,640
what we call a mushroom is actually a

1250
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,119
fungal organism that's got

1251
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,319
what i call three plant parts mushrooms

1252
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,480
don't have seeds

1253
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,920
so how do you grow a mushroom well

1254
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,559
mushrooms have spores

1255
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,838
the spores will germinate into a fine

1256
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,358
filament called a haifa those haifa come

1257
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:32,799
together and produce what's called

1258
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:34,559
a mycelium this is the actual body of

1259
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,000
this organism

1260
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,039
when conditions are right it will

1261
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,838
produce a mushroom

1262
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,679
and then that mushroom will will uh grow

1263
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,358
up mature it'll produce spores we've got

1264
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,679
a completion of the life cycle so we've

1265
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,239
got three plant parts we've got spore

1266
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,598
we've got mycelium and we've got

1267
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,199
mushroom now the mushroom is what's

1268
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,280
traditionally been used

1269
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,519
as medicine and the mushrooms very

1270
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,119
complex on what it can

1271
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,719
actually produce but they're actually

1272
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,200
products out there where they grow the

1273
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,759
mycelium but they grow it on a

1274
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:10,239
sterilized grain

1275
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,359
in a laboratory and at the end of the

1276
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,838
process

1277
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,039
once the grain has been covered with the

1278
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,400
mycelium

1279
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,880
they will actually uh

1280
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,599
dry it grind it to a powder grain and

1281
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,559
all

1282
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,079
and sell it as mushroom so this is one

1283
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,960
of the key issues out there again it

1284
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,039
gets back to

1285
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,240
would somebody want to be selling a

1286
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,079
cannabis product and they're just

1287
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:35,519
grinding up leaves and saying hey here

1288
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,720
i've got these great joints of a

1289
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,119
pot and it's like well no no of course

1290
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,879
not

1291
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,640
i mean that's something maybe in the in

1292
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,160
the 60s we might come across right

1293
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,960
somebody would say hey i got this great

1294
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,598
pot it's like

1295
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,720
oh yeah huh tastes pretty bad what is

1296
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,640
this really right

1297
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,639
well that's what's going on right now in

1298
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:55,759
the medicinal mushroom

1299
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,358
uh category there are products out there

1300
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,359
that are not mushroom yet they're being

1301
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,318
sold as mushroom they are mostly

1302
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,598
starch so and you know one of the things

1303
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:07,039
i'd like to stress here too

1304
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,000
is that what i love and i'm sure you

1305
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,559
guys do too

1306
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,480
and that is analysis i mean that's one

1307
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,838
of the things that cannabis is really

1308
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,119
built on is analyzing and and

1309
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:21,679
this was something in the mushroom

1310
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:24,640
category that was non-existent

1311
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,199
uh five years ago where maybe they would

1312
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:27,598
be measuring what are called

1313
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,919
polysaccharides

1314
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,200
um when in fact polysaccharides can also

1315
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,280
be the starches and these

1316
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,318
products that are that are manufactured

1317
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,800
on this grain

1318
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,318
well grain is a polysaccharide we have

1319
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,280
tests for beta glucans that can

1320
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:40,960
demonstrate

1321
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,720
that we've got the compounds in there

1322
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,920
that are actually important

1323
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:45,679
those are the compounds that provide the

1324
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,559
medicinal benefits the immunological

1325
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,679
benefits

1326
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:52,000
these myceliated grain products are

1327
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:55,919
mostly starch with very low amounts of

1328
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,079
beta glucans if you know what tempeh is

1329
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,119
that's actually what's being ground up

1330
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,839
to a powder

1331
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,318
and sold as mushroom and if you hear

1332
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:06,719
people out there touting

1333
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:09,599
mycelium um basically

1334
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,279
they're not mycelium is good on its own

1335
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,838
not quite as good as the mushroom but

1336
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,440
it's

1337
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:18,318
it's um it's sometimes spoken about

1338
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,920
or or being sold but it's on this grain

1339
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,639
as a carrier

1340
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,920
so for us that's the key thing that you

1341
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,279
have to look for when you're out there

1342
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,680
looking for a

1343
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,280
mushroom product and and primarily look

1344
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,879
and see whether they're analyzing for

1345
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,599
the beta glucans because that's

1346
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,920
the important compound you you want to

1347
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,318
see

1348
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,519
if they say polysaccharides well forget

1349
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:39,358
it it's probably

1350
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,039
one of these other products and maybe

1351
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,358
you'll have a really high number of

1352
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:45,599
of polysaccharides but that's because

1353
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:49,598
the product is mostly starch

1354
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,480
so so again we love to analyze we have

1355
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,519
about four

1356
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,920
different compounds that we analyze for

1357
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,079
every single lot that we produce it'll

1358
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,119
be beta glucans alpha glucans

1359
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,119
ergosterol ergothionine

1360
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,880
we've got a profile it's got to meet

1361
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,800
that profile then when you're talking

1362
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,000
about let's first let's for example try

1363
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,160
terpenoids

1364
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,599
we've reached a point now where we can

1365
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,920
actually

1366
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:18,559
analyze for up to 20 of these

1367
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,400
triterpenoids and get a much more robust

1368
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,119
profile and this is kind of like the

1369
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,680
future of analysis for us when it comes

1370
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,800
to

1371
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:29,598
the reishi mushroom or or chaga to where

1372
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,519
now we've got this amazing profile much

1373
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,880
like you guys have this these profiles

1374
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,838
of the cannabinoids

1375
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,400
i mean it's just a whole new universe

1376
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:39,119
for us

1377
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,000
in terms of as we move forward and being

1378
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,039
able to

1379
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,358
to actually uh have this type of profile

1380
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:45,679
for

1381
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:46,799
our reishi for example it seems to make

1382
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,239
it really clear that

1383
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,920
it doesn't matter really whether we're

1384
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,519
talking about cannabis

1385
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,680
or mushrooms or terpenes

1386
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,838
there's there's so many people trying to

1387
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,239
do it different ways and so many of them

1388
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:01,679
are

1389
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:03,679
being motivated by the dollar

1390
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,519
that it's important to always do your

1391
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,239
homework to make sure that the products

1392
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,800
that you're

1393
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,078
blending together our good products to

1394
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,560
begin with

1395
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,680
and we are still at a point in this

1396
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,318
market where

1397
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:18,559
no matter what you're buying um you will

1398
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:22,480
be rewarded by doing your homework

1399
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:25,679
well you know what the fact that

1400
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,039
the operation has been us

1401
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,919
been with us since the beginning of

1402
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,679
commerce i mean it's just a fact of life

1403
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,280
out there so it doesn't really matter

1404
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:40,318
what herbal product it is for example uh

1405
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,640
adulteration is out there and always

1406
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,719
will be

1407
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,400
i was gonna say something it sounds like

1408
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:49,039
uh in the world of

1409
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,960
cannabis versus uh mushrooms it's

1410
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,838
interesting as he was describing that

1411
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,760
we and like from our side you know we we

1412
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,519
see this as the trichomes develop

1413
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,960
as first little stalks and then they get

1414
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,039
that little mushroom head

1415
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,559
you know from an extractor side it's

1416
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,239
like i'm i can't even

1417
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:05,920
i'm like i can't extract if i don't have

1418
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:07,279
the mushroom head right

1419
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,119
and i was like so what he's what he's

1420
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,960
basically saying in our

1421
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,160
in my kind of world is that he's saying

1422
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,400
that there's people out there that

1423
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,239
aren't even getting to the resin gland

1424
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,480
they're just growing the little stock

1425
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:20,639
they're not even doing it on the plant

1426
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,400
they're doing it on some other they're

1427
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:22,639
like on a yeast like when you hear like

1428
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,358
oh

1429
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,000
someone's growing like thc on yeast

1430
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:28,400
there's

1431
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,838
it's like apples and oranges here you

1432
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,119
know it's like two different things but

1433
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:32,400
it's interesting because he's got a big

1434
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,760
macro mushroom head

1435
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,880
and we're looking for those little micro

1436
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,520
mushroom heads because that's where all

1437
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,960
the the nutrient dense base is

1438
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:42,159
um and i also looked at your uh

1439
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,079
testing when he was talking about the

1440
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,838
testing thing which we're also big into

1441
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,880
testing and providing a certificate of

1442
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:48,799
analysis

1443
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,480
you guys have been like fda approved

1444
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,680
since like

1445
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,760
90 something like 96 or something

1446
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,279
well well you know what nobody actually

1447
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,119
gets fda approved

1448
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,800
in that sense you know certainly not in

1449
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,358
in our industry i mean there's

1450
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,000
there's fda laboratories that you could

1451
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,039
have things

1452
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,519
analyzed by um and we

1453
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,719
no i'm not uh not fda i'm sorry you're

1454
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,280
um

1455
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:15,039
certified organic since 19. oh yes i

1456
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,200
mean my company's been certified organic

1457
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,599
since

1458
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:20,480
1993. i mean i totally believe in that i

1459
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,200
mean you were talking

1460
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,960
before about how something is produced

1461
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:26,879
our mushrooms are produced as

1462
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,000
naturally as possible and one of the key

1463
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,400
things about is we produce

1464
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,318
them on natural substrates and most

1465
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,358
medicinal mushrooms for example

1466
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:37,199
grow on wood that's what we use to grow

1467
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,199
our mushrooms it's like the wood is

1468
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,039
important it's got the precursors

1469
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:42,559
necessary to produce those medicinal

1470
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,358
compounds so

1471
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,358
so again you know it is something where

1472
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,318
and the whole the whole process i mean

1473
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:49,759
when we're finished

1474
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:53,199
that wood that the mushroom has been

1475
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:56,640
growing on now that gets to be recycled

1476
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,358
onto the fields as an adjuvant to the

1477
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,078
soil

1478
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,279
in some cases they dry out that uh wood

1479
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,039
block that the

1480
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,119
mushrooms come off of and they use it as

1481
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:05,920
fuel there's just uh you know there's

1482
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,760
very little

1483
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,200
waste in that and not only that

1484
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,920
mushrooms generally are

1485
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,519
growing on agricultural waste products

1486
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:18,318
they're an amazing

1487
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:20,960
organism i mean can you imagine

1488
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:21,599
straw and sawdust and everything else

1489
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,240
that's out there

1490
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,880
after growing all of the foods that we

1491
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,919
eat

1492
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,000
or the the timber that we're using

1493
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,358
i mean what do you do with all that

1494
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,400
material well

1495
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,279
you know feed it to the mushroom it will

1496
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,680
love you for it

1497
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,800
it will produce you a good food or a

1498
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,358
good medicine

1499
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,119
so so for us and you know this is it the

1500
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,759
mushroom is an organism this fungal

1501
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,960
organism

1502
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,720
it repurposes organic matter

1503
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,280
so that's part of what it's doing out

1504
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:54,480
there in the environment all of that

1505
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,319
the leaves the perennial uh

1506
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,159
annual plants that grow up and die every

1507
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:01,599
year the wood that falls down

1508
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:03,279
repurposing it into humus

1509
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,280
so let's move on a little bit uh so

1510
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,359
ethan terpenes

1511
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,119
like mushrooms are also vastly

1512
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,039
increasing in popularity

1513
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,119
and of course a great deal of the credit

1514
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,039
for uh people's interest in

1515
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,960
terpenes goes to your milestone paper

1516
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:20,639
that we've already talked about

1517
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,760
um humans have been using terpenes for

1518
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,920
healing and romance for ages um

1519
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,880
what what are the different ways that we

1520
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,599
can consume

1521
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,920
terpenes and what is the mode they use

1522
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,800
to

1523
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,639
influence our human functioning sure

1524
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,359
well let's start at the beginning

1525
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:38,400
uh so uh terpenoids come in different

1526
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:40,719
flavors

1527
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,680
uh that relate to the number of carbon

1528
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,239
atoms

1529
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:47,199
uh in cannabis we're usually talking

1530
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:50,078
about monoterpenoids with 10 carbons

1531
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,719
cesco terpenoids with 15 there's a

1532
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,640
single

1533
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:56,480
uh diterpenoid which is phytol it's only

1534
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:58,318
present after drying

1535
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,159
and then there are tri-terpenoids but

1536
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:01,599
only in the roots so that's something

1537
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,480
that cannabis roots

1538
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,160
and the medicinal mushrooms have in

1539
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,440
common

1540
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,318
the monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids

1541
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,679
are what give

1542
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:15,679
cannabis its its specific aroma

1543
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:18,399
people may be surprised to learn that

1544
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:21,679
the cannabinoids themselves are odorless

1545
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:26,000
you could have a a bucket full of

1546
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:28,159
pure thc and there'd be no aroma to it

1547
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,358
but what they are really doing is

1548
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,639
synergizing

1549
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:35,519
with the cannabinoids

1550
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,838
and modulating their effects on this can

1551
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,239
come

1552
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,000
in different flavors but mainly we think

1553
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:43,118
in terms of

1554
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,159
modulating the psychoactivity

1555
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,720
tc when there's too much of it

1556
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,838
produces anxiety rather than alleviating

1557
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:53,199
it but

1558
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:56,639
that can be modified by other components

1559
00:49:53,199 --> 00:50:00,318
um historically both

1560
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:03,838
pinene from pine nuts and limonene

1561
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,480
from lemons or other citrus were noticed

1562
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:06,719
to be

1563
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,719
good for people who had overindulged

1564
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,719
with hashish or whatever it was

1565
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,318
and then there are agents like linalool

1566
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,680
which we don't see

1567
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:20,558
as much of uh as we should have

1568
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,919
in most uh chemovars chemical varieties

1569
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,960
of cannabis and

1570
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,680
it's a very powerful um

1571
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,960
anti-anxiety agent without being overtly

1572
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,159
sedating

1573
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:35,119
so these are just a few examples but uh

1574
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:37,279
additionally synergy includes the

1575
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,640
ability to contribute to

1576
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,480
the therapeutic effect an example there

1577
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,558
is caryophyllene

1578
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,800
which works on what's called the cb2

1579
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,920
receptor that's the non-psychoactive

1580
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,160
receptor

1581
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,760
that also is a pain reliever an

1582
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:56,558
analgesic receptor an anti-inflammatory

1583
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,800
so having a lot of caryophyllene will

1584
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,079
contribute to its ability to treat pain

1585
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,119
or inflammation

1586
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,800
without adding to the high which often

1587
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,200
isn't necessary because there's plenty

1588
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,280
of thc around

1589
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:10,719
so ethan while we have you and while we

1590
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,280
have the audience's attention

1591
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,279
i would like to uh give you the platform

1592
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,760
to speak on one of my favorite topics

1593
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,800
that you

1594
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,240
speak on which is you know so much of

1595
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,318
the consumer market

1596
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,679
is trying to get the most bang for their

1597
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:25,440
buck and so

1598
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,919
they go and they are shopping for the

1599
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,639
highest percentage of terpene

1600
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,039
that a laboratory will will say they

1601
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,679
have

1602
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:38,480
right and what thc

1603
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:41,039
yeah so right would you explain how um

1604
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:44,079
as far as the experience goes

1605
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:47,440
um the the higher the thc

1606
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,119
it's it means a lower terpene profile

1607
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,400
and how we want to get that more into

1608
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,119
balance

1609
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,800
yeah well it may uh particularly with

1610
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,800
concentrates when we're talking about

1611
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,920
vape pens you'll often see that there

1612
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,000
could be as much as

1613
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,599
90 thc or mixed cannabinoids and

1614
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,119
leaves very little room for the

1615
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,280
turbinoids

1616
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,760
one of the problems that we're seeing is

1617
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,119
a lot of the co2 extraction which is

1618
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,880
very clean

1619
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,240
is done in a way that it really

1620
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,119
squanders the terpenoid content

1621
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:22,000
and so it resembles nothing like the

1622
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,240
fresh flower from which it was derived

1623
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,318
and this is really a shame i would

1624
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,879
advocate to people that

1625
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:29,838
the number on the thc is not really that

1626
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,039
important

1627
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:37,039
you can always get more by an additional

1628
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:39,119
inhalation or a little bit more orally

1629
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,318
but what you really are looking for is

1630
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,559
the effect

1631
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,838
and i think what bud tenders should be

1632
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,319
asking

1633
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,279
consumers is what are you trying to do

1634
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,159
with this

1635
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,519
not how high do you want to be uh you

1636
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,838
know are they doing this

1637
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,759
to treat anxiety are they doing this

1638
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:57,759
because they need to clean the garage

1639
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,240
and cut the boredom

1640
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,920
whatever it is there is a terpenoid

1641
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:04,799
profile that's going to enhance the

1642
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,079
experience and i really would underline

1643
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,640
that word enhance three times because

1644
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,519
that is really what it's about

1645
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:15,440
i think this message that just smoking

1646
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,280
as much thc as we can

1647
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,720
without understanding that terpenes

1648
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,960
sculpt the high

1649
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,078
is one of the most important consumer

1650
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,920
messages that

1651
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,079
we as a group of folks trying to produce

1652
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,760
medicine and educate people can say

1653
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,359
so thanks for weighing in on that i

1654
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,920
would love to jump in if that's cool

1655
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:32,639
yeah so you know when when nevada first

1656
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,599
opened up

1657
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,639
and washington first opened up people

1658
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,599
are coming in

1659
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,759
and buying strictly on the thc and some

1660
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:45,680
of the best herb i've ever smoked

1661
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,280
might be 16 17 thc but the terpenes and

1662
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:47,679
the cannabinoids and everything else in

1663
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,319
it

1664
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:51,598
make it so much better and so i you know

1665
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:53,039
urging everyone else that's watching

1666
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,800
this just like you said there's so much

1667
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:56,558
more that goes into some good herb

1668
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,839
that will do a lot more for your body

1669
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,839
than the thc

1670
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,039
you know me and my friends joke about

1671
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,199
it's the guy that wants to go get the

1672
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:04,239
thickest burger it may not be the best

1673
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:06,558
it's kind of dry

1674
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:08,000
it's big you know what are you looking

1675
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,960
to get do you want a tasty burger do you

1676
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,920
want to enjoy your

1677
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,000
so thc uh you know people shopping for

1678
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,480
just a tac number it's just not the best

1679
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,760
idea

1680
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,519
there's so much more that goes in the

1681
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,720
plant that makes it special and that

1682
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,318
helps your body and

1683
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:21,759
makes you enjoy that smoke than just a

1684
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,800
thc i've never been a

1685
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,319
let me get a 30 thc guy you know i'm let

1686
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,760
me get the best smelling the most

1687
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:30,239
euphoric the best

1688
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,680
you know what the best looking for for

1689
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:32,799
myself you know there's so much more

1690
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,519
that goes into it so

1691
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,839
i'm glad you touched on that because big

1692
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,199
yeah

1693
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:39,599
i like jumping on that too because

1694
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:42,239
there's a big misconception with that

1695
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,599
and i i subscribe to exactly what both

1696
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:45,358
these guys are saying

1697
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,760
in the sense that somewhere along the

1698
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:48,558
line the consumer has got it in their

1699
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,880
mind

1700
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,079
that the highest thc is the best bang

1701
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,039
for the buck

1702
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,200
and this is this is the latest thing in

1703
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,639
the last definitely a couple years

1704
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:00,000
it's the worst thing because i just

1705
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:01,199
don't understand where it came from

1706
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,358
because ultimately our

1707
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:04,480
our bio essay like what we go to smell

1708
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:06,558
that we want

1709
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,798
the consumer like you know at least for

1710
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,559
me for 20 years

1711
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,400
smoking cannabis is what does it smell

1712
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,079
like what does it taste like and most

1713
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,160
importantly what's the effect

1714
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,680
on your body what is the effect that i'm

1715
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:20,639
looking for and so

1716
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:21,118
i can tell you from the extract side and

1717
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:23,440
i

1718
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,960
am a i'm a terpene hunter right i'm not

1719
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,400
so much about the terps and that's why

1720
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,480
i'm sitting here and that's why

1721
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,760
we do projects together because they're

1722
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,920
creating

1723
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,440
terpene flavors that are mimic things in

1724
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,119
life that we're used to that we're like

1725
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,760
familiar with and i think when you take

1726
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,838
the

1727
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,680
the brain and somebody's a consumer and

1728
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:41,279
like i smell something like this gelato

1729
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:43,279
or this cookie or this type of

1730
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,559
lemon cello you know it's like it's like

1731
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,960
a familiarity

1732
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,680
that like i have i smell this somewhere

1733
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,679
else

1734
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:52,078
i recognize this but it also has that

1735
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,919
cannabis you know smell too

1736
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,920
and then what's the effect and he nailed

1737
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,079
it about the different types of terpenes

1738
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,680
and ultimately um this is where i kind

1739
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,440
of geek out with extracts

1740
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:03,039
when someone says oh the flan or the

1741
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,480
turoni like i come up with

1742
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:08,239
uh names that um are are these like

1743
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,280
familiar to desserts based on their

1744
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,798
textures but it's

1745
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,319
actually what i'm doing with my

1746
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:14,838
signature extracts

1747
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:17,599
is i'm modulating him it's because of

1748
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,400
him once i take a solvents extract i'm

1749
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,838
like

1750
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,720
am i once i'm able to get thc a thc the

1751
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:24,400
full spectrum

1752
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,318
all of the terpenes and remove all the

1753
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,680
lipids and waxes and cellulose

1754
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:29,679
and i can say to myself well now i'm

1755
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,798
gonna i'm gonna build

1756
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:35,358
a designer dab here for an effect

1757
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:37,119
and so when i deal with rosin that's to

1758
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,960
me a full spectrum effect

1759
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,318
right and then i do a tarone and that's

1760
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,599
like cleaning it up a little bit like

1761
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:43,279
he's talking about the burger

1762
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,280
but i'm actually overlaying certain

1763
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,480
things to create a modulation effect

1764
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,319
and the flan is the most most modulation

1765
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,838
effect so i'm actually able to like

1766
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:53,599
look at something and target something

1767
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,039
and most of our extracts

1768
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,798
you know what we're known for is

1769
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,480
everyone's averaging extract is like

1770
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:01,119
three to five percent

1771
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,798
but we've had this conversation before i

1772
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,440
don't have to reintroduce

1773
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,960
anything if it's already in the plant so

1774
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,679
there's a lot of times where we would do

1775
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,358
like

1776
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,199
uh cookies extractions someone's like oh

1777
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,279
that's 15 or 20 percent

1778
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,439
terpenes it's like they didn't need a

1779
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,359
reintroduction if the terps are there

1780
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,639
so and that's your that's what i always

1781
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:20,639
call the volume knob

1782
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,759
you know and so like we all watched i'm

1783
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,960
sure these guys were familiar with

1784
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,720
spinal tap right

1785
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,639
i remember as a kid i was like those

1786
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:28,879
dudes got amps that go to 11

1787
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,798
right and so that's what we're trying to

1788
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,400
do we're like well can i get it to 15

1789
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:34,318
can i that's what i'm doing as a kid i'm

1790
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,240
like can i get this thing any louder

1791
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,400
and it has nothing to do with the thc we

1792
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,959
don't go to the bar and order everclear

1793
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,599
you get you get a chopin or a hennessy

1794
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,159
or

1795
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,680
you know a nice um bourbon or something

1796
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:46,960
you're not saying give me ever clear i

1797
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:47,838
want to get i want to get as drunk as

1798
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,519
possible

1799
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:51,119
you get the drink you enjoy that tastes

1800
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:54,239
best and you know

1801
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:57,119
that's that's part of that's my opinion

1802
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:58,159
i think he also has a uh another paper

1803
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,559
out there

1804
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:02,000
maybe that you did once upon a time with

1805
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,200
another company i'm not really sure i

1806
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
thought it was you

1807
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:06,879
that um they had a study about just pure

1808
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,719
thc

1809
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,079
without terpenes and what that effect

1810
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:11,519
was and then we looked at

1811
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,440
i think then you know there's other

1812
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,838
papers about synthetic thc

1813
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,358
and how it relates to pain and just pure

1814
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:18,639
thc like he was saying

1815
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:21,279
doesn't have a smell it doesn't have a

1816
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:23,199
flavor doesn't have a lot of medicinal

1817
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,000
effect it's only when you start adding

1818
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,159
these like

1819
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,519
nuances of terpenoids and you start

1820
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,440
building those profiles

1821
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:31,679
that we start to see a real medicinal

1822
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,318
effect from anything

1823
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,960
another great thing too is uh when

1824
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:36,719
people start

1825
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,000
purchasing based on terpenes it's going

1826
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,239
to change

1827
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,719
the dynamic of the market because right

1828
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:44,399
now it's strange to think that consumers

1829
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:48,078
are buying cannabis

1830
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,160
based on what company could influence

1831
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:53,359
their local analytical lab

1832
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:54,960
to give them a higher percentage and

1833
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:56,798
oh gosh you know we all know that that's

1834
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,720
a problem in the industry right now

1835
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,318
whereas i would much rather people are

1836
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,879
buying based on

1837
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:03,679
what companies are able to treat their

1838
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,440
flower

1839
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:09,598
well not not cause the terpenes to

1840
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,200
volatilize off and who's using good

1841
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,039
genetics to begin with

1842
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,279
and i think that's where our emphasis

1843
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,960
should be instead of what lab we happen

1844
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,599
to use and what influence we have over

1845
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,159
them

1846
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,200
so so moving on we're going to come back

1847
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,440
to you tony

1848
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,318
so so you were just talking about the

1849
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,039
the really

1850
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:28,798
high quality terpenes at good numbers

1851
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,239
that give a really great experience

1852
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:31,199
we're going to talk about the other side

1853
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:32,318
now right

1854
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,399
because since we're talking about

1855
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,400
quality we should talk about um

1856
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,440
what happens to lower quality terpenes

1857
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,119
so

1858
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,119
when we're considering synergistic

1859
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,079
medicinal compounds we have to be aware

1860
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:46,640
of how quickly terpenes degrade right

1861
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,480
and what are some of the causes to

1862
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:52,480
terpene degradation

1863
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:55,838
and what is left when a terpene degrades

1864
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,920
great question so we touched the uh

1865
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,480
russo touched upon this a little earlier

1866
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,400
monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes

1867
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,639
and ultimately in the world of cannabis

1868
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,680
this is live fresh frozen

1869
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:10,159
right when the plant is alive it's got

1870
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,118
a real high abundancy of monoterpenes i

1871
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:12,639
would say

1872
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,640
it's probably got about 80 percent of

1873
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,159
the full profiles of mono chirping when

1874
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:18,400
it's alive and on the plant

1875
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:19,598
and if you disagree i have no problems

1876
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,519
you correcting me

1877
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:25,599
um right um so from from my experience

1878
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:27,440
when the plant's alive and it's cut down

1879
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,720
if it's quickly frozen

1880
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,960
we're going to have a lot of mono

1881
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,639
terpenes if we were to cut that plant

1882
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,079
down and naturally dry it traditionally

1883
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,239
dry it for smoking

1884
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,839
we start to see the go from lots of mono

1885
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,679
terpenes and they're volatile

1886
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:41,199
at room temperature so people that are

1887
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:42,000
carrying their cannabis they try to keep

1888
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:44,078
it around 60

1889
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,599
65 if they know what they're doing they

1890
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,119
keep it at certain humidity

1891
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,640
because they're like trying to preserve

1892
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,358
the flavor in it as they're trying to

1893
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:50,558
cure it

1894
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,078
but let's say if you kind of got a

1895
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,519
little warmer or you let it dry some

1896
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,880
people were sun drying it back in the

1897
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,280
day

1898
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,559
you would start to see this monoterpene

1899
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,160
from it being alive to when it's

1900
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,160
completely dried and cured

1901
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:04,000
it starts it you start to see less of

1902
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:07,199
that and more sesquiterpenes

1903
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,000
so i actually started uh in 2015

1904
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:12,000
extracting fresh frozen live

1905
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,639
monoterpenes from flowers

1906
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,838
and i would extract terpenes of

1907
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,239
sesquiterpenes

1908
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:19,519
and i saw a clearly different uh two

1909
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:22,078
different pathways

1910
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:24,239
and for me i and we kind of educate

1911
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,960
people as well we have different uh vape

1912
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:27,598
carts

1913
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,440
that are dried and cured and more

1914
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,318
sesquiterpene based and the ones that

1915
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,358
are live

1916
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:35,599
are going to be more monoterpene and one

1917
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:37,440
tastes very fresh like the plant

1918
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,119
and those trichome heads are not

1919
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,200
oxidized and they're

1920
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,160
retained you know at low temperatures

1921
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,519
the whole time

1922
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,838
and so what ends up happening is that i

1923
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:49,599
think

1924
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:51,519
those that are traditional smokers

1925
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,039
tend to actually like the dried

1926
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:54,559
sesquiterpenes

1927
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,480
right because if i've given i've given

1928
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,200
10 people out the live cart and i give

1929
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,559
people

1930
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,239
a cure card if they didn't look at it

1931
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,519
because it obviously looks different

1932
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:02,719
they just did a blind test they'd be

1933
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:04,000
like if they're a smoker they're gonna

1934
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,078
they're gonna hit that cart

1935
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,599
and like wow that tastes just like just

1936
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,880
like the herb

1937
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:12,798
the people that are desiring those uh

1938
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,920
fresher mono terpenes are going to be

1939
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:17,038
looking for like this

1940
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,920
totally different real plant live taste

1941
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,960
and feeling

1942
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,280
however they evaporate very quickly so

1943
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,318
um those that are making uh live

1944
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,960
extracts

1945
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,000
have a shelf life problem right so when

1946
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,159
the product goes

1947
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,519
onto the uh shelf and they have a live

1948
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:33,118
rosin and they say hey here's what i

1949
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,358
look like and i look cool in the picture

1950
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,880
it can quickly dry up and so what you

1951
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:37,679
end up happening this could actually use

1952
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,838
to your advantage

1953
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:41,519
and back in the day i would i would be

1954
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:45,358
able to utilize

1955
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:49,119
monoterpenes for a recrystallization or

1956
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:51,358
precipitation of cbd or thca

1957
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,880
or different things to precipitate out

1958
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,078
from a base of all these other

1959
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,480
cannabinoids

1960
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,920
hope allowing the terpenes to evaporate

1961
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,760
this was like kind of what i was doing

1962
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,200
a long time ago and i don't do that

1963
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,680
anymore but

1964
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,558
i learned that how do like you said how

1965
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,399
do we capture

1966
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,079
these beneficials and monoterpenes

1967
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,039
without letting them just fly off into

1968
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,039
the air

1969
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,720
and so that is like where i started

1970
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,559
doing these like different extracts and

1971
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,639
flans and jellies and things where

1972
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,839
how do i how do i break this apart and

1973
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:21,038
then utilize

1974
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:23,119
active thc and raw thca

1975
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,559
and those terpenes and create almost a

1976
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,200
natural preservative

1977
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,640
within those actual extracts to hold and

1978
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:31,118
trap those together

1979
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,118
and then obviously the next transition

1980
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,599
was well i need to be able to powderize

1981
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,519
this

1982
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:37,680
or put this into a suspension of a

1983
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,280
liquid and then be able to retain it as

1984
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:40,159
real medicine which then gets into a

1985
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,519
capsule

1986
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:44,399
and so i think that that is the biggest

1987
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:46,559
challenge

1988
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,318
is being able to capture those from the

1989
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,200
cannabis side and what i really liked

1990
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:50,798
about what

1991
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:52,719
with jeff and what he was talking about

1992
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:55,199
and as i researched his company

1993
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:57,118
was the other group of terpenes right

1994
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:00,239
and so and i learned something today

1995
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,838
which another chapter will open in my

1996
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:03,598
mind because of you

1997
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,279
about the roots of cannabis and these

1998
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,798
mushrooms having the same terpenes

1999
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,680
thank you for that one because i'm going

2000
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:12,798
to start making terpenes from roots

2001
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,159
because what i realized is that he's

2002
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:15,679
making a pure product

2003
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:17,358
we're doing the same thing on our side

2004
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:18,879
he's a 10 to 1 ratio

2005
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:20,960
and he's being able to get these very

2006
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,079
heavy concentrations of that terpene

2007
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,440
concentration we don't even know what

2008
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,519
that synergistic

2009
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,720
effect is yet we start laying these

2010
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:30,559
cannabinoids on

2011
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:33,279
we start laying these terpenoids on from

2012
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:36,400
cannabis and i'm able to preserve those

2013
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,680
right and i'm able to uh overlay them

2014
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,200
like we were talking about earlier with

2015
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:40,159
the terpenes that's coming from his

2016
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,078
mushrooms

2017
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:44,558
because he's using the purest form of it

2018
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:47,119
he's getting the highest concentration

2019
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:50,000
this is an unknown synergistic effect

2020
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,000
that excites me

2021
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:55,199
all right so bernard you've worked

2022
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,559
extensively in the cannabis community to

2023
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:58,639
curate flowers

2024
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,480
that have an attractive aroma and

2025
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,239
desiring healing effects

2026
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,240
what have you learned from consumers

2027
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:06,719
about what they actually look for in a

2028
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:08,879
terpene experience

2029
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,318
they love the like the fruity foodie

2030
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,039
type smells

2031
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:14,960
we we came out with cherry pie sunset

2032
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:18,480
sherbet gelato

2033
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,960
biscotti um you know the the food kind

2034
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,199
of flavor profile the sweet

2035
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,400
to kind of sweet and gassy people love

2036
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,199
that um

2037
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,680
i i curate our menus and and encourage

2038
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:31,199
our breeders to go strictly for a flavor

2039
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,879
we're not really hunting for the biggest

2040
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:33,439
yielding plant we're not really hunting

2041
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,680
for

2042
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,480
the most thc we're going for the most

2043
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:40,159
enjoyable

2044
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:43,920
smoke possible you know cannabis is now

2045
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:45,598
recreational and it's 2020 2020 20

2046
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,039
you want to be able to enjoy your smoke

2047
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,480
as much as possible so

2048
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,400
what we look for and what i've seen

2049
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,798
people react to more more than anything

2050
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,960
is

2051
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:55,759
the good smelling the good tasting

2052
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,240
flavors we kind of we kind of

2053
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,280
got a hype around flavors exotics is

2054
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:01,358
what they call them

2055
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,200
people are really into og kush they're

2056
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:04,719
really into the hazes they're into the

2057
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,078
train wrecks and stuff like that but

2058
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:08,078
once we introduce

2059
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,440
this certain flavor profile that was

2060
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:11,440
sweet and

2061
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,519
very aromatic and would leave like a

2062
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,318
soap pissy smell in the air

2063
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:16,880
it became you know a huge huge hype and

2064
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:18,960
so

2065
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,000
i think that our customer base is

2066
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,920
looking for flavor

2067
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,760
over everything so i've got two

2068
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:27,119
follow-ups on that the first one

2069
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:29,839
is um in your experience um are

2070
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,119
do people are they aware that there is

2071
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:32,960
terpenes

2072
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,240
that the terpenes are playing a role in

2073
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,559
what they like

2074
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,558
and so they are buying with their nose

2075
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,680
and they're familiar with the vocabulary

2076
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,079
of terpenes

2077
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:43,279
or are most people all like oh this is

2078
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,599
the gelato

2079
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:47,039
i smell the gelato i like the gelato

2080
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,920
without ever actually thinking about

2081
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,599
terpenes

2082
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,000
yeah i think there's a not a lot of

2083
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,280
education around terpings

2084
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,838
you know like they mentioned earlier

2085
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,680
people are shopping for thc but

2086
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:59,199
there's no denying that no as you pop

2087
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:00,078
open that jar and that's why we created

2088
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,960
the jar we we

2089
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:04,318
the way we did once you smell it i mean

2090
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,480
it's like when you smell some good home

2091
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:08,239
cooking you know you smell a restaurant

2092
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,798
walking down the street he knows doesn't

2093
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:12,078
lie and i think that people are just

2094
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:13,519
shopping on based on what they're

2095
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,880
smelling what they're seeing

2096
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:16,400
and i think that you know hopefully

2097
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,079
after people watch this they're educated

2098
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,358
on actually how big of a role terpenes

2099
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,960
play on cannabis

2100
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:23,038
the second follow-up is uh you know

2101
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,519
you've got a long breath of experience

2102
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,319
with uh curating for the public right

2103
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:28,400
and

2104
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:29,838
and as you're saying the things that uh

2105
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,639
people are most attracted to

2106
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:33,759
at this point in the market are um of

2107
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:35,679
sweet smelling

2108
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,119
uh food reminiscent things that have got

2109
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:39,440
some gas to them right and

2110
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,960
and i agree i like those as well but i

2111
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,519
also like

2112
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,280
a lot of the cultivars that we used to

2113
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:47,759
get that were rank right

2114
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,039
they smelled like baby diapers or

2115
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,520
rotting flesh

2116
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,480
or some of this really gross stuff that

2117
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:55,038
but that when you

2118
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,199
taste it you're all like that gross

2119
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,240
thing is so delightful and the buzz is

2120
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,480
so wonderful

2121
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,239
do you think that with a consumer-driven

2122
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,519
market we're going to lose those old

2123
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:05,358
nasty beautiful things

2124
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:06,880
no absolutely not especially because i

2125
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:07,838
got a breeding project going in at my

2126
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,200
house right now

2127
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:10,798
and i'm bringing all those old school

2128
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:12,318
gases back and that's why i named

2129
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,159
cheetah piss cheetah piss

2130
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:16,158
to kind of get the consumer away from

2131
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:18,479
looking for the you know um

2132
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:20,000
you know ice cream cake or the you know

2133
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,519
the fruit roll up like that's cool

2134
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,960
that's cute we've done that for a while

2135
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,560
i'm bringing back the gas

2136
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,759
so when i'm breeding myself personally

2137
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,960
and this is the first time i've actually

2138
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,798
done my own breeding project

2139
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,079
instead of you know art directing a

2140
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:31,759
breeding project i'm bringing

2141
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:33,519
straight gas back and there's going to

2142
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,158
be a lot of baby diaper and

2143
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,520
you know a lot of a lot of burnt rubber

2144
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,039
kind of vibes and

2145
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,560
you know as a pie head you want to have

2146
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,679
a variety you want to have a lot of

2147
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,199
different tastes so

2148
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,119
my goal is to keep that alive and to

2149
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,960
educate you know our customers while i

2150
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:48,318
still got a good voice and platform that

2151
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,319
there's so much more out there than the

2152
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,039
fruity stuff some of these old school

2153
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,120
gasses

2154
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,960
and the super skunks and the kind of

2155
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:57,039
musty dirty stock smell

2156
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,119
it's still good it's a very different

2157
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:00,479
height and it may smell crazy but when

2158
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:02,559
you smoke it it's just

2159
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,158
you're like wow that's that's gym socks

2160
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,319
it tastes nuts like you know

2161
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,278
so i'm into bringing that back to life

2162
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,120
for sure

2163
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:10,319
so ethan i'd love to get your thoughts

2164
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:12,559
on this too you know

2165
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,839
um as as thinking about the medicinal

2166
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,440
nature of

2167
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:18,318
uh terpenes um and people are often very

2168
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,039
attracted to these

2169
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,400
these sweet terpenes is there anything

2170
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:25,039
that you might have to add about the

2171
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:27,439
medicinal benefits of these these smells

2172
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:29,439
that we would normally consider gross

2173
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,639
but as you develop a connoisseurs

2174
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,919
palette for cannabis

2175
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,239
you actually find yourself very

2176
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,719
attracted to ah

2177
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:37,358
sure i don't deny that that's the case

2178
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,359
um

2179
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:41,199
you know it really depends on the blend

2180
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,798
the proportions of these different

2181
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:45,599
components and

2182
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:47,838
the funny thing about turbinoids is a

2183
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,400
trace component

2184
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:51,278
really totally alter the smell and with

2185
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,679
these complex

2186
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,040
mixtures once there's more than three

2187
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,000
terpenoids it's really

2188
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:59,039
hard for anyone even experienced people

2189
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,640
to really

2190
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:06,158
have an idea of what's in it um

2191
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:09,679
you know i use the comparison

2192
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:12,879
if we blindfold somebody

2193
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:15,199
and put before their nose a lemon a lime

2194
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,640
and a grapefruit

2195
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:18,399
everybody is going to be able to tell

2196
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,320
them apart they all have

2197
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:22,399
limonene at their base but it's the

2198
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:23,759
trace components that really make the

2199
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:26,799
difference in the

2200
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:29,039
both aromas and the flavors and the same

2201
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,840
would be true about the effects

2202
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:33,279
um you know the psychopharmacological

2203
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,400
effects

2204
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:39,039
so you know it's uh an art and a science

2205
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:41,279
um i spend a lot of time looking at

2206
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:43,519
certificates of analysis and

2207
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,519
you know i also want to know how how are

2208
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,280
people affected by this

2209
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,400
and they're generally if you know what

2210
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:53,840
you're doing they're good correlations

2211
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:56,158
so i think this really highlights that

2212
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,039
one of the advantages of cannabis as a

2213
01:10:56,158 --> 01:10:59,439
medicinal

2214
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:02,560
is that it really brings about the

2215
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:05,678
possibility of individualized medicine

2216
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,679
you know we really can tailor uh the

2217
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:09,440
contents of the cannabis to what the

2218
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:13,199
person really needs

2219
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:15,839
uh you know what ails them on how do we

2220
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:16,719
help them with that through the right

2221
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,560
profile

2222
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,000
in in cannabis we're going to take a

2223
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,440
short break and be right back

2224
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,279
you are listening to shaping fire

2225
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,960
with the national hemp program influx

2226
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:27,759
due to stringent thc testing

2227
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,439
requirements

2228
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,039
brother seth and eric crawford continue

2229
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:32,000
to release seeds to hemp farmers that

2230
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:33,840
will be legal

2231
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,158
no matter how you grow them or when you

2232
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,159
test them these new varieties from

2233
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:39,759
oregon cbd seeds have substantial

2234
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:43,198
amounts of cbdv

cbgv cbcv and thcv

2236
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:46,879

2237
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:49,039
three percent thc limit

2238
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,960
and guaranteeing compliant crops for

2239
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:52,800
farmers every time

2240
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,158
also these new varieties cannot be

2241
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,440
pollinated by your neighbor's

2242
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:58,238
uncontrolled pollen

2243
01:11:55,439 --> 01:12:00,799
or a rogue male in your own crop either

2244
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:01,839
oregon cbd seeds are non-gmo certified

2245

2246

2247
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,640

2248
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,719
maxing out their personal credit cards

2249

without outside investment

2250
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,600
they continue to refuse outside

2251
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:15,279
investment that would change their

2252
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,000
company culture

2253
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:19,840
oregon cbd grows tons of fresh food on

flour to patients

2259
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,520
as their company began to succeed seth

2260
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,159

2332
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:55,679
as a business owner you are incredibly

2333
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:56,960
busy in reality you are responsible for

2334
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,800
everything your company does

2335
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,480
you've got so many responsibilities

2336
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,760
every single day that often you just

2337
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,839
don't have the time to really

2338
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,880
dig into your marketing as deeply as

2339
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,000
you'd like

2340
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,679
you know there's more that you could do

2341
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,279
to reach out to new customers and

2342
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,000
encourage loyalty and the customers you

2343
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:11,599
already have

2344
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,039
but you certainly don't have the time

2345
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,360
for it and you're not ready to hire

2346
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:18,238
somebody full time for that role either

2347

01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,560
excited to make your logo

2353
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:30,559
packaging and website very pretty but

2354
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,520
they leave responsibility for improving

2355
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,520
your bottom line

2356
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,560
up to you they don't want that kind of

2357
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,080
responsibility

2358
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,480
but that's pretty much the most

2359
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:39,920
important part of marketing right

storefront

2364
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,000
and keep them coming back to you and

2365
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:49,839
telling their friends

2366
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,840
now if you happen to be a new cannabis

2367
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,159
company or an established company moving

2368
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,719
from medical to adult use in your state

2369
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:57,920
kirsten especially can help you not only

2370
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,000
is she well reversed

2371
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,079
in marketing and finance but she totally

2372
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,319
gets cannabis whole plant medicine

2373
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,640
terpenes heritage farmers and the

2374
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:08,479
particular needs of startups

2375
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,719
check out what she did recently for moon

2376
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,639
time medicinals and humboldt at moon

2377
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,239
time medicinals.com

2378
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,760
kirsten and her team put together a

2379
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:17,198
whole brand package for them

2380
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,520
built their website and wrote their

2381
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:21,119
sales materials no doubt this is a paid

2382
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,480
commercial spot but that does not mean

2383
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,399
they bought my opinion

2384
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:25,919
i've worked with blunt branding on five

2385
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:26,639
projects now for various of their

2386
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,319
clients and

2387
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,679
every single time they have done more

2388
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,119
than they have promised and over

2389
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,199
delivered on results

2390
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:35,039
i love how they generate new revenue and

2391
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:37,198
focus on that as the goal instead of

2392
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:39,039
just making a pretty logo

2393
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:40,719
similarly every single friend i've

2394
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,039
referred them to has come back to thank

2395
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,198
me

2396
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:44,960
and that just does not happen every day

2397
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,238
grab a pen and paper because the website

2398
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,840

tony verzura jeff chilton and berner

2419
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,239
let's return to the panel discussion now

2420
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:28,238
so one of the first alternative

2421
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:31,039
medicines people often turn to

2422
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:33,279
in their life is cannabis but few folks

2423
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:35,439
understand the general action that

2424
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:36,719
cannabinoids the active ingredient in

2425
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,119
cannabis take

2426
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:41,279
and i know that an explanation of the

2427
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:42,559
endocannabinoid system could take hours

2428
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:45,119
because we've done that on

2429
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,840
the shaping fire podcast right but for

2430
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,000
today

2431
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,000
can you distill it down and give us a

2432
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,238
summary of what cannabinoids

2433
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,719
are in the cannabis plant and how they

2434
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:57,119
generally interact with the human body

2435
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:58,000
sure well it is a very complex issue but

2436
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:01,359
we have this thing

2437
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,640
called an endocannabinoid system within

2438
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:07,359
us the endocannabinoid system is the

2439
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:09,679
master regulator of homeostasis

2440
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:13,039
homeostasis is a balance in

2441
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:14,960
function let's look at the brain

2442
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:16,158
we have neurotransmitters chemical

2443
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:20,719
messengers between

2444
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:23,198
nerve cells the endocannabinoid system

2445
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,279
regulates their release it actually

2446
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:27,519
inhibits the release

2447
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:29,679
so if it inhibits a stimulatory

2448
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,480
neurotransmitter it damps down that

2449
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,600
signal

2450
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:37,399
if it inhibits an inhibitory signal

2451
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:40,320
it's magnifying the effect but the more

2452
01:18:37,399 --> 01:18:43,599
endocannabinoid cb1 receptor

2453
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:46,319
a receptor in the brain that

2454
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,039
have a greater density than that for all

2455
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:51,119
of the neurotransmitters put together

2456
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:53,760
and so that's any aspect of brain

2457
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,679
function as influenced by the

2458
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,039
system but the same thing applies to

2459
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:00,880
digestion

2460
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:04,880
or any other functions of our body

2461
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,359
so this really gives the foundation for

2462
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,480
why

2463
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:11,039
cannabis as a medicine is so versatile

2464
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,639
for so many different conditions it's

2465
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:16,719
not a panacea

2466
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:20,239
but it is amazingly versatile

2467
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:22,000
in what it can do for many conditions

2468
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:25,519
where conventional medicine just

2469
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,238
doesn't quite do the job properly

2470
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,120
right on thank you so back to you tony

2471
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:32,319
so tony

2472
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:35,439
everyone um on this round table

2473
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:36,000
uh is a proponent of whole plant and

2474
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:37,678
fungi

2475
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,760
medicine meaning that the medicine

2476
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:42,239
should respect the structure

2477
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,760
that nature provides in it some folks

2478
01:19:42,238 --> 01:19:46,718
get confused about what

2479
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,920
is and isn't a whole plant and

2480
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:51,119
unfortunately with

2481
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,760
um the arrival of extracts and and some

2482
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,279
of these

2483
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:57,440
um these these newer products people are

2484
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,439
been playing with the vocabulary to

2485
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,799
include their products when they often

2486
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:02,799
might not

2487
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,039
some folks get confused about this so

2488
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,480
how should we think about the oils of a

2489
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:09,760
cannabis plant as

2490
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:12,158
whole even though it's no longer a part

2491
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:15,199
of the entire plant

2492
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:18,399
another good question um

2493
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:20,638
okay so the way i look at this is

2494
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:21,759
it's very interesting because when we

2495
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:24,800
talk about

2496
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,719
a full spectrum oil as an example

2497
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,920
we have to think about how did we get to

2498
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,840
that right

2499
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,440
so we were talking he was talking about

2500
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,920
co2 earlier

2501
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:34,638
and co2 itself is under a lot of

2502
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,960
pressure

2503
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:39,679
and it takes the buds themselves and it

2504
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,198
passes at very high psi

2505
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,719
from gas to liquid and it goes through

2506
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:44,719
the plant and it generally

2507
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,079
pulls a lot out of the plant it's a

2508
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:48,960
clean process

2509
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:50,960
i personally don't like this process

2510
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,760
because of a couple of things

2511
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,198
it's not the process of the co2 it's the

2512
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,960
post-processing

2513
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:58,719
because if we're able to pull all of

2514
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,679
this raw extract out and if you were to

2515
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:03,279
stay with

2516
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:05,359
raw co2 and did nothing else

2517
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:06,479
that's a different conversation but

2518
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:07,119
you're going to be pulling a lot of

2519
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:10,000
these

2520
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:11,679
lipids and plant fats and waxes and

2521
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,039
honestly a lot of heavy metals

2522
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:15,920
because of the way that extraction

2523
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:16,800
method works and so everyone tends to

2524
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,239
winterize or

2525
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,320
de-wax their full-spectrum oil

2526
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:23,359
right and in the process of using

2527
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:25,439
ethanol

2528
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:27,279
is what they do it's an eight-to-one and

2529
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:29,759
so they just take that muck

2530
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:31,439
they pour alcohol over it and then they

2531
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,480
like turn it into a solution and they

2532
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:34,238
freeze it and then they

2533
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:36,399
bind that alcohol to the fats and then

2534
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:38,879
they pour everything out which as

2535
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:40,879
russo knows destroys all the terpenes

2536
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:44,159
because we're also talking about polar

2537
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,440
polar semi-polar nonpolar and polar

2538
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:47,039
properties of the plant

2539
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:48,479
and so if we're really talking about a

2540
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:51,198
true full spectrum

2541
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:53,359
oil that's been unadulterated it

2542
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,559
wouldn't be co2 through winterization

2543
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:56,960
it wouldn't be ethanol through

2544
01:21:54,560 --> 01:22:00,560
distillation it wouldn't be

2545
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:02,719
a hydrocarbon and then distillation

2546
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,760
but if we talk about hydrocarbon and

2547
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,359
there and

2548
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,679
there are good extraction methods with

2549
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:09,920
hydrocarbon that's using

2550
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,119
uh and those monoterpenes and terpenes

2551
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:13,119
that we were talking about they're also

2552
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:14,960
a group of hydrocarbons so terpenes

2553
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:17,439
themselves are hydrocarbons

2554
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,600
um and the hydrocarbon used in the bho

2555
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:21,919
extraction actually kind of binds to it

2556
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,440
and so it's a low psi pass so it's going

2557
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,560
to pass right through and if they know

2558
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,919
what they're doing and they have a full

2559
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,840
recovery system

2560
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,039
they're making live resin and making all

2561
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,239
these particular uh

2562
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:35,039
oils that's really a full spectrum oil

2563
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,559
if there's none of the butane left in it

2564
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:38,158
but again we have to look at ourselves

2565
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,000
and say well did that

2566
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:41,198
chemical or that solvent that passes

2567
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,600
through the plant

2568
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:45,359
alter the full spectrum oil and to me

2569
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,039
the answer is also yes

2570
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:48,559
and so that then takes us to the next

2571
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:51,359
category of

2572
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,000
of say particular flower rosin so we

2573
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:53,920
moved to flower

2574
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,119
rosin right and so when we get to a

2575
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,239
flower rosin

2576
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:59,840
similar to co2 much less waxes we would

2577
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:01,439
have eight to twelve percent but we're

2578
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,319
actually going to get a full spectrum

2579
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:04,000
oil

2580
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,158
out of flower rosin if we just press the

2581
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,039
flowers put them under pressure we are

2582
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:08,960
basically

2583
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:10,158
using high pressure and steam to secrete

2584
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,079
all of expel

2585
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:14,000
all of those oils that's a true

2586
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:16,559
solventless

2587
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
full spectrum oil will have some of the

2588
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,080
lipids and waxes in there

2589
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,079
but if we were talking about that before

2590
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:23,760
and we said what's the cleanest and

2591
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:26,399
the most accurate representation is

2592
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,760
flower rosin however

2593
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:29,119
in the dabbing world if we were using

2594
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,400
that for capsules and other things it

2595
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:32,479
would be very good

2596
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:34,158
in the in the world of where we're at

2597
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:36,319
the scalability

2598
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:38,079
of creating that being able to say hey

2599
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:40,000
do you have 100 pounds can you press a

2600
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:41,039
hundred pounds of flowers this week to

2601
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,719
keep up

2602
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:47,359
that's also very difficult and

2603
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:49,039
to be able to take that flower rosin it

2604
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:50,880
used to be a popular thing like four

2605
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:52,639
years ago but then dabbers

2606
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,319
they start using quartz and they start

2607
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,600
using puffco peaks and different things

2608
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:57,198
and like man

2609
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,600
leaving a bunch of stuff behind so

2610
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,279
that's the waxes so then

2611
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,280
we then there's only a couple other

2612
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:04,960
methods right and then we move to hash

2613
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:05,840
rosin or live rosin which then we're

2614
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,880
just

2615
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:11,600
separating out all the resin glands

2616
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,159
to get a full spectrum profile of the

2617
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,480
actual

2618
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:15,439
uh plant so we have to say to ourselves

2619
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:17,439
there's

2620
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:18,559
you know there's a lot of terpenes

2621
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:21,359
there's about 50

2622
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,960
of the plants terpenes are inherently in

2623
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,599
the leaf and in the surface of

2624
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,520
of the leaf but then the ones that we're

2625
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,039
actually desiring that we want to smoke

2626
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,199
and has the most abundant

2627
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,119
is in the heads so just like what jeff

2628
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:35,279
was talking about these mushroom heads

2629
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:36,639
i'm looking for the trichome heads and

2630
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:37,759
so when we separate

2631
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:39,039
we're going to get heads and we're going

2632
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,880
to get a little bit of the stalks in

2633
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:43,279
there and so

2634
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,480
when we talk about a full spectrum from

2635
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:46,000
a hash rosin

2636
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:48,319
we're trying to isolate the best of the

2637
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,880
fruit right and so i'm going to try to

2638
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:50,639
pick

2639
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,319
these grades of fruit from it and if we

2640
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,000
were talking about a lemon tree

2641
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:55,679
and and the tree was ripe you know if

2642
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,760
you hit the tree the right time

2643
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,600
you're able to shoulder it boom all the

2644
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,840
lemons that come off as your first

2645
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,280
the best the best lemons and you kind of

2646
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,639
pick through the tree as it gets ripe

2647
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:07,519
and you pull those off

2648
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,319
and so for me personally i'm going to

2649
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,560
try to get

2650
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:11,359
all of the best fruit to make my juice

2651
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,600
from it

2652
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,119
to make that full spectrum oil now when

2653
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,639
i do that

2654
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:18,800
that's where i then take it to the next

2655
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,319
level where people like you said there's

2656
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,960
misunderstandings where they think oh

2657
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:25,439
you're reintroducing you're altering it

2658
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,119
when i could get to this particular

2659
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:30,158
before it gets to that oil

2660
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:31,679
let's say we were able to get um expel

2661
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:33,439
all of those heads so if we're looking

2662
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,840
at the surface of the trichome head as a

2663
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:35,678
grape

2664
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,679
like like as the grape is i want to

2665
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:40,158
remove these skins

2666
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:41,600
and that is when we make hash rosin or

2667
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:43,119
live rocks and we're pressing it

2668
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,960
and we're keeping the skins in there but

2669
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:47,119
a little bit of those skins

2670
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,960
melt in the process and it gets into

2671
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:51,920
live rosin or gets into hashrats

2672
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,800
not a lot much less than flower rosin

2673
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,760
and so we're going to

2674
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,800
and somewhere around three percent what

2675
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,760
all i'm doing

2676
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,239
is being able to remove those impurities

2677
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,079
and it's

2678
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,119
naturally allowing the terpenes and

2679
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:05,279
naturally allowing all these other

2680
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:07,279
cannabinoids to boost themselves

2681
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:09,279
so the world of what i'm saying

2682
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:11,439
deconstructing and rebuilding

2683
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:12,960
it's kind of just like an easier way to

2684
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:14,638
educate people because it's already

2685
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,399
difficult for you guys to

2686
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,920
for everyone to like follow that and

2687
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:19,920
that's why i went from terpenoids to

2688
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,920
terpenes and just terps

2689
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,000
like it's the terps right and then it's

2690
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:27,199
like people were like what's your wax

2691
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,039
now we're like no wax right so

2692
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:30,319
deconstruction people get that in their

2693
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:32,158
head and it's just an

2694
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:33,439
artistic way of saying hey i'm just

2695
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:35,119
breaking these things out

2696
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:36,479
but i'm really maintaining and

2697
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:37,359
preserving the things so for me

2698
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:40,638
personally

2699
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:41,839
full spectrum uh is is getting to the

2700
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:44,000
purest portion

2701
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,440
and trying to do a ten to one as what

2702
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,960
jeff's doing and some of the extracts

2703
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:48,399
that i'm doing i'm even getting to a 15

2704
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,880
to watch

2705
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:53,119
i like that explanation too because it

2706
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,039
again focuses on the fact of how much

2707
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:56,639
consumer education that we all have to

2708
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:58,238
do as an industry

2709
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,840
because i mean how many of these threads

2710
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:01,198
have we seen online where people are

2711
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,920
arguing about this

2712
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:06,399
when nobody involved in the discussion

2713
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:09,520
actually understands the science right

2714
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:11,279
so hey so hey jeff um you know earlier

2715
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,760
you were talking about how

2716
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:15,679
um the different varieties of mushrooms

2717
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,639
uh play well together

2718
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,520
and and how uh the the you know ancient

2719
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:21,760
chinese folks

2720
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,080
recognized this and they they made these

2721
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:27,760
um these these blends

2722
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:30,559
when i go to uh my acupuncturist

2723
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:32,000
um she is going to do some physical

2724
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,480
acupuncture on me

2725
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
she's probably going to recommend a

2726
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:38,799
mushroom blend for me

2727
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,639
for whatever i'm looking for relief from

2728
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:44,560
but then she also gives me

2729
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:46,400
you know a particular diet and foods and

2730
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,080
i actually she actually told me she

2731
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:49,920
wanted to learn more about terpenes too

2732
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:50,399
recently and it was funny i gave her a

2733
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,319
uh

2734
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,319
a true terpene sampler i'm like here

2735
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:56,799
start smelling these and learn right

2736
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:57,679
but where i'm going with this is that

2737
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:01,679
she says that

2738
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:05,119
mushrooms are a a type of medicine

2739
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:07,840
that plays well with other medicines

2740
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:09,359
and um you know because i pay her based

2741
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,119
on time i couldn't get a full

2742
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:12,839
explanation from her

2743
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,158
but i'm really curious to hear your

2744
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:17,840
insight on

2745
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:20,559
on mushrooms ability to play well

2746
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,920
with these other uh synergistic inputs

2747
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,920
we've been talking about

2748
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:27,840
like uh like cannabis and terpenes

2749
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,039
well well you know you know what chango

2750
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:32,239
there there's

2751
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:33,519
actually not that much research out

2752
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:35,919
there on that subject

2753
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:37,120
specifically you know the way the way i

2754
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,319
look about

2755
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:40,960
at mushrooms is that they are um in a

2756
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:43,599
sense

2757
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,960
food is medicine so you can start out by

2758
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,560
by just putting them in your diet

2759
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,279
mushrooms are kind of a forgotten food

2760
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,960
in asia

2761
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:50,880
everybody eats mushrooms there's like 12

2762
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,359
15 different species in the marketplace

2763
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,840
that

2764
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,679
that people are eating and this kind of

2765
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,400
too gets back to what ethan was

2766
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:00,158
referring to

2767
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:02,399
earlier about products that

2768
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:03,198
actually will help with homeostasis for

2769
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:06,079
example

2770
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:07,519
mushrooms are the perfect food and

2771
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:09,519
medicine in that in that sense they're

2772
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:12,040
they're what are considered an adaptogen

2773
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,719
and adaptogens that's kind of their role

2774
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:15,279
homeostasis harmony i mean when you talk

2775
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,840
to

2776
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,880
anybody in china chinese medicine

2777
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,719
traditional chinese medicine

2778
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,800
practitioners for example too

2779
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:24,560
that's really what they're trying to do

2780
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,880
i mean disease they just look at that as

2781
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,039
you

2782
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,800
you're out of balance some way so

2783
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:31,760
they're really trying to bring you

2784
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,279
back into balance and so for me that's a

2785
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,960
big part of what mushrooms do

2786
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:36,639
they're they're one of the great

2787
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:40,000
balancers they're one of the

2788
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:42,319
the great harmony herbs out there and

2789
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,319
and so

2790
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:48,559
since you know you can combine them

2791
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:51,279
together but the one thing you have to

2792
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,159
to understand too is it is that

2793
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:55,920
sometimes

2794
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:57,679
when you put too many different

2795
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,600
uh for example in this case mushroom

2796
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:03,039
species together

2797
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:04,400
you end up diluting the primary species

2798
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:05,519
that are giving you the the major

2799
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,000
benefits there

2800
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:10,080
so so you can only go so far i mean you

2801
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,158
know how sometimes there's a race to

2802
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:13,760
um like what i call the kitchen sink

2803
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:16,559
products out there too

2804
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,400
you know everything in one jar you never

2805
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,679
have to eat anything else or supplement

2806
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:20,719
with anything else because it's got

2807
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:23,760
everything you need

2808
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:25,920
and it's like well no thank you right

2809
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,840
um there's a there's a certain level

2810
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,158
where you do have a synergy

2811
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,039
or where where putting things together

2812
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:34,079
makes sense

2813
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:36,000
but for example for me there are maybe

2814
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:37,920
five mushrooms that i would say okay you

2815
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,600
get to get up to five

2816
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,119
don't go any further because now you're

2817
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,760
just going to to

2818
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:44,800
actually lessen the benefits that you're

2819
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:48,079
looking for

2820
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:50,480
and so so really and again

2821
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:51,840
the um in terms of synergies it's kind

2822
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,519
of interesting because there is actually

2823
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,760
a study that was just done

2824
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,600
in australia where they were utilizing

2825
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,880
our mushroom extracts and they

2826
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:03,920
they um it was testing them against

2827
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:06,079
a whole panel of cytokines

2828
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,359
and so they were okay what is uh what

2829
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:09,279
kind of cytokine

2830
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:11,039
stimulation do we have there and we've

2831
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:12,399
got each single one

2832
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:14,880
how they did and then when they put them

2833
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:18,559
together actually they got

2834
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:20,480
a higher level of cytokines production

2835
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,320
through the putting the three together

2836
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:25,119
than each one individually

2837
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:25,759
so there's definitely those types of

2838
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:28,238
benefits

2839
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,600
from putting them together but we're

2840
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:32,319
still kind of

2841
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,719
uh new in that sense there i mean we're

2842
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:35,198
not

2843
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:37,039
anywhere close to being what uh tony's

2844
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,759
doing right now for example with the

2845
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:40,479
triterpenes i mean uh and the other

2846
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,119
thing too is

2847
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:44,000
getting back to just full spectrum what

2848
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:47,279
what i'm really trying

2849
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,560
to do is i'm trying to bring everything

2850
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:52,800
out of the the dried mushroom

2851
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,239
all of the constituents of it i don't

2852
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,960
want to leave anything behind in my

2853
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:56,238
extracts

2854
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,679
i mean we're not we're at the point

2855
01:31:56,238 --> 01:31:58,000
where we're trying to build up this or

2856
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,239
build

2857
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,399
up that what we can do there is

2858
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:04,158
basically through the cultivar itself

2859
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:05,519
because different cultivars for example

2860
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:06,799
reishi cultivars

2861
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,040
are going to have different levels of

2862
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:12,480
tri-terpenoids

2863
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:13,439
a researcher that i saw his presentation

2864
01:32:12,479 --> 01:32:17,279
back in their

2865
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:18,000
2002 tested 12 different cultivars of

2866
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:20,079
reishi

2867
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,520
the level of triterpenes was from 2 to

2868
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:24,238
12 it was

2869
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:26,000
just amazing so the key thing for us is

2870
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:28,638
making sure that we have

2871
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,039
a cultivar that's going to give us a a

2872
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:32,319
good

2873
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:35,279
measure of try terpenoids which i think

2874
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:38,399
are really important and what sets

2875
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:40,238
ganoderma or the reishi apart

2876
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:43,599
so i think that's very important

2877
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:43,599
constituent of that

2878
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:50,800
we really to the the cultivar itself

2879
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,679
and testing it to make sure our starting

2880
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,320
material

2881
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:56,319
when we are creating that extract is

2882
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:59,119
high in what we want

2883
01:32:56,319 --> 01:33:00,639
right on thanks jeff so ethan you know

2884
01:32:59,119 --> 01:33:03,840
um

2885
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:07,039
because because this panel is

2886
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:09,600
uh involves cannabis chances are that a

2887
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,359
lot of the folks who end up watching it

2888
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,440
are going to be tokers you know people

2889
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:17,359
who have smoked cannabis for some

2890
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:20,559
or all of their life and you know as the

2891
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:24,479
only medical doctor on the panel today

2892
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:27,760
i would like to hear your thoughts on um

2893
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:31,198
alternative forms of ingesting

2894
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:33,360
um these synergistic

2895
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:34,479
medicinals that we're talking about most

2896
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:38,158
of us are used to

2897
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:41,279
smoking our cannabis medicine in um

2898
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:43,119
in flower form and and and you know more

2899
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:44,238
people are getting interested in edibles

2900
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:47,119
but honestly

2901
01:33:44,238 --> 01:33:49,519
a lot of folks are are selling you know

2902
01:33:47,119 --> 01:33:52,880
a cookie or a gummy or something

2903
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:55,600
that um is is more like candy and maybe

2904
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,400
some companies use isolate and all this

2905
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,480
whereas

2906
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:59,439
if people are really thinking about the

2907
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:03,198
medicinal

2908
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:05,198
nature of delivery um capsules are a

2909
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:07,439
really good way to go

2910
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:09,039
um but the thing is i've never explained

2911
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:11,039
to people why that's true

2912
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:14,158
i just know it's true from working with

2913
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:16,800
patients so would you talk to the idea

2914
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:19,119
of of taking um you know these

2915
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:22,239
synergistic medicines in a capsule

2916
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:23,920
form to kind of educate people on why

2917
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:25,519
putting the stuff in their belly works

2918
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,600
for them sure

2919
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,159
well let's preface this by saying that

2920
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,800
uh you know i i really don't recommend

2921
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:34,960
uh smoking because of lung irritation

2922
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:37,360
vaporization is better

2923
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,319
and in terms of getting the most bang

2924
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:41,679
for the buck

2925
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:44,479
from turbinoids vaporization

2926
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:46,000
or topical application that does get

2927
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:47,439
through the skin

2928
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,840
those are both going to be really

2929
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:52,238
efficient when

2930
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:54,000
terpenoids are taken orally they're not

2931
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:57,039
going to be quite as

2932
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:00,079
prominent they certainly will have

2933
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:01,679
effects you don't lose that entirely the

2934
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:04,960
effect orally

2935
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:07,440
is going to be better when there is a

2936
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:10,639
lipid carrier in other words

2937
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:11,839
with a fat um and certainly with a gel

2938
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,118
cap that is an

2939
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:19,600
oil base you're going to get

2940
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:24,319
a good absorption of the turbinoids

2941
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:24,320
and with a proper edible

2942
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:30,000
with a proper edible there will

2943
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,000
definitely be a difference

2944
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,359
that people will appreciate as compared

2945
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,198
to an isolate with

2946
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:40,799
just a cannabinoid

2947
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:43,359
right on and so um while we're used to

2948
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,079
you know smoking our cannabinoids and

2949
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:46,158
having it

2950
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:47,519
um you know hit our bloodstream through

2951
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:50,479
our lungs

2952
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,280
um you're saying that when we take it as

2953
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:53,519
a capsule

2954
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:55,198
and and it finds its way to our stomach

2955
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,080
that our stomach is very effective in

2956
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:57,759
pulling all these

2957
01:35:56,079 --> 01:35:59,760
apart and while they may have a

2958
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,400
different experience we're still getting

2959
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,639
the

2960
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:03,439
medicinal qualities from it is that a is

2961
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,239
that a

2962
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:08,000
right of summation that's true when

2963
01:36:06,238 --> 01:36:08,479
terpenoids are taken orally they're

2964
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,760
going to

2965
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:14,799
hit the liver and be metabolized

2966
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:15,280
somewhat faster when they're inhaled

2967
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,199
they're

2968
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:19,359
going to have the ability to go straight

2969
01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:20,479
to the brain without passing the liver

2970
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:22,399
first

2971
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:23,519
so again the effect is going to be more

2972
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,799
pronounced

2973
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:28,800
but with a good formulation orally

2974
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,400
it will get absorbed and it will

2975
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:34,159
modulate thc

2976
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:36,960
and the other cannabinoids so certainly

2977
01:36:34,158 --> 01:36:38,399
you know in a gummy it's most likely

2978
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:41,679
going to be an isolate

2979
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,158
just thc you're not likely going to see

2980
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,719
a full

2981
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:47,279
a lot of full spectrum gummies that are

2982
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,639
going to give a quality experience

2983
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:51,519
and i wouldn't think of those as

2984
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:54,880
medicines for the most part

2985
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:56,639
cool thank you ethan so so we're to our

2986
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:58,639
last question of the panel

2987
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,639
and it's going to be the same question

2988
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:01,600
for everybody so but i want to hear all

2989
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,920
of your thoughts

2990
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,000
as we look into the future and kind of

2991
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,719
put our visionary hats on

2992
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,198
and um as far as answering it in the

2993
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:11,679
order

2994
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:12,479
i'm gonna ask it first to burner and

2995
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:14,239
then jeff

2996
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:15,519
if you would jump in and answer the

2997
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:16,959
question and then ethan

2998
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,560
will come to you third and then we'll

2999
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:21,359
finish off with

3000
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,639
uh with tony here so this last question

3001
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:25,439
is the same for all of you

3002
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:27,199
and it's about your motivations and

3003
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:29,839
hopes for the future

3004
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:32,000
uh of synergistic medical blends all

3005
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,960
right so where where we want to see

3006
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,760
our community go while pharmaceuticals

3007
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,800
can do much

3008
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,520
good and we've all seen the substantial

3009
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,880
amount of

3010
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,280
bad that they can do too that has led to

3011
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,199
this

3012
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:46,479
our movement towards alternatives we are

3013
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:47,039
seeing now we've been talking about

3014
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:50,000
today

3015
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:52,880
and we all participate in what is your

3016
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,198
vision of the future for the creation of

3017
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,679
new

3018
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:57,198
medicinal blends and an increase in

3019
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:59,840
their accessibility

3020
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:01,198
to patients directly so let's go ahead

3021
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:03,199
and start with burner

3022
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:06,158
yeah i feel like um it's our job to

3023
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:08,000
educate we all had different platforms

3024
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:09,599
these guys know the science of it a lot

3025
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,198
more i've been

3026
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,600
experimenting with some stuff that tony

3027
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:14,079
created and it's kind of a blend on some

3028
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,000
of the stuff

3029
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:18,000
we talked about today but i've noticed a

3030
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,279
major change in my body

3031
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,118
when it comes to anxiety i've had

3032
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:23,198
anxiety for a very long time i have to

3033
01:38:21,118 --> 01:38:24,079
take xanax to kind of calm my body down

3034
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:26,319
and

3035
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:27,198
wasn't really having the best sleep uh

3036
01:38:26,319 --> 01:38:29,359
because of

3037
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:31,279
metformin which i take because of my

3038
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:35,198
diabetes and whatnot and

3039
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:37,198
recently just mixing um the cbd the cbn

3040
01:38:35,198 --> 01:38:38,719
and some of the mushroom blend that tony

3041
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:39,118
has put together has really changed my

3042
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:41,118
life

3043
01:38:39,118 --> 01:38:42,639
for the better a lot and i feel like

3044
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:44,719
it's my job

3045
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:45,920
to have you know i have a nice platform

3046
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:47,520
and a voice to the black and brown

3047
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:50,158
community into the urban community

3048
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,920
to educate them on on this a lot of

3049
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:53,679
people think mushroom they think um

3050
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:56,000
we're getting high or they think gas

3051
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:58,639
station mushrooms uh not really

3052
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,920
real mushrooms you know so my i feel

3053
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:02,800
like my role right now

3054
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:04,560
my kind of mission and the future of

3055
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,840
plant medicine is to educate put in

3056
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,920
hands and

3057
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:10,560
kind of help everyone's bodies i feel

3058
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,079
like the cbn i never really was up on

3059
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:15,039
cbn i didn't really understand

3060
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:16,639
how how important cbn is or stevie g

3061
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:18,319
i've just been a pothead for a long time

3062
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:21,279
and i've been smoking her but

3063
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:22,960
by taking daily blends i've noticed a

3064
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:25,039
big change in my body and my sleep

3065
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:28,239
patterns and my anxiety

3066
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:29,519
and so a lot of people that i speak to

3067
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:32,238
my audiences

3068
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,360
deal with a lot of post-traumatic stress

3069
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:36,479
anxiety

3070
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:38,719
pain depression sleep problems

3071
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:40,000
especially the diabetics so you know i

3072
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:42,079
think the future of

3073
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,079
plant medicine is educating putting in

3074
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,679
the hands and providing real access

3075
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:47,519
we don't want people to buy gas station

3076
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:49,199
mushrooms and have a bad experience

3077
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,119
we don't want people to buy gas station

3078
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:51,519
cbd for their grandma that really needs

3079
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:54,158
it

3080
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:56,000
we want to provide safe real credible

3081
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:56,879
access to medicine that's helped change

3082
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,880
my life

3083
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,079
and so i just look forward to being able

3084
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,920
to to kind of

3085
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:03,439
you know roll this out properly and kind

3086
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,199
of just educate my people

3087
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:07,039
the younger people the people that don't

3088
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:08,879
really think that that this is a

3089
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:10,560
medicine or any of these things mushroom

3090
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,760
or cannabis is a medicine so we talked

3091
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,119
about that earlier but

3092
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,960
that's kind of my agenda and my

3093
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:16,158
objective moving forward is just

3094
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,439
putting in the hands of people and

3095
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:19,039
letting them understand it's really good

3096
01:40:17,439 --> 01:40:20,559
for your body it's beneficial and

3097
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,479
a lot of stuff that we're prescribed

3098
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:25,199
like metformin uh or

3099
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:26,718
xanax is not the best for us long term

3100
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:28,960
we our bodies don't want that

3101
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:30,639
you know so there's there's ways that

3102
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,639
that we can educate put in a

3103
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:34,800
put in the hands and just kind of like

3104
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,239
you know his education will be a lot

3105
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,600
different than mine which would be a lot

3106
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:39,678
different than yours which would be a

3107
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:41,760
lot different than his but combined

3108
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:43,279
is very powerful i think we all need to

3109
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,400
play our role for sure

3110
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:48,238
thanks so uh so jeff uh let's get you on

3111
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:50,238
this so so where do you see the

3112
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:51,599
you know where would you like to see

3113
01:40:50,238 --> 01:40:54,079
these synergistic

3114
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,440
medicinals come together going forward

3115
01:40:54,079 --> 01:40:57,198
well let me first say

3116
01:40:55,439 --> 01:41:00,719
um it looks like we've got a new term

3117
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:00,719
that's come out of this gas station

3118
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:08,319
mushrooms

3119
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:09,678
that's that's really a good one

3120
01:41:08,319 --> 01:41:11,439
you know you know it's really what's

3121
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:13,679
really interesting having been

3122
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:14,879
in in like the supplement industry for

3123
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:17,279
quite a while i mean i started growing

3124
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,800
mushrooms in 1973 commercially so i've

3125
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:19,439
been doing that for a long time but in

3126
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,880
terms of

3127
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:24,079
the supplement industry i've been there

3128
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,480
since 1989 when when mushrooms were

3129
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:27,118
still

3130
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:29,118
not even in the industry at all no

3131
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:31,039
company had a mushroom product and i had

3132
01:41:29,118 --> 01:41:34,559
to really do a lot of education

3133
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:35,039
but back then the the industry was full

3134
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,080
of

3135
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:39,439
actual herbalists and people who were

3136
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:41,279
you know some of them actually coming

3137
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:43,359
out of being cannabis growers for

3138
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:47,279
example i mean people who were

3139
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:51,039
really deep into it in a totally

3140
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:53,198
different way let's say

3141
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:55,279
today and one thing that's happened is

3142
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:58,238
is our industry has gone

3143
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:59,759
from what i would call products that are

3144
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:00,718
a little more natural a little more

3145
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,280
earthy to

3146
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:04,880
a pharmaceutical model and and a lot of

3147
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:05,920
that has come just from the regulations

3148
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,760
that have been put in place

3149
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,158
we we are saddled with regulations that

3150
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:12,159
make us adhere to a pharmaceutical model

3151
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:13,439
the way everything is produced in terms

3152
01:42:12,158 --> 01:42:14,238
not necessarily the way we grow our

3153
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:16,719
mushrooms

3154
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:17,599
that's still quite quite natural but in

3155
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:20,719
terms of

3156
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:22,320
uh processing and in terms of the the

3157
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,920
different standards that we have to meet

3158
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:26,158
before we can sell the product

3159
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,760
and that's something that i'm really

3160
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:28,479
kind of concerned about and so are a lot

3161
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,000
of people in

3162
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:32,718
in the industry because i i'm totally

3163
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,920
believing in organic production and

3164
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:36,800
certified organic

3165
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:39,359
products and keeping with that whole

3166
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:42,880
whether it be regenerative agriculture

3167
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:46,639
or or basically staying closer to

3168
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:48,880
the earth and and not so much into

3169
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:50,480
the pharmacy so to speak those those

3170
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:52,480
kind of sterilized

3171
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:54,158
you know it's like it's like getting a

3172
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:55,919
certificate of analysis and you look at

3173
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:56,960
the heavy metals in there pharmaceutical

3174
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,600
model would be

3175
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:01,118
um or the micro for example the micro

3176
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:03,679
biological panel

3177
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:04,799
zeros you know if i see zeros i think

3178
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,719
okay now

3179
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,639
somebody along the line has irradiated

3180
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:11,520
this or done something to it to

3181
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:13,679
kill off all the microbes and that's not

3182
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:17,840
a place where we really want to go

3183
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:19,840
so so for me um going forward

3184
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,760
what i think is really important is just

3185
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,400
maintaining that

3186
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,880
natural component of this and not

3187
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:28,158
getting

3188
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:29,840
too far away from what it's really about

3189
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:30,559
it's just it's like me being in mexico

3190
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,840
back in the

3191
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,719
70s and and you know smoking the

3192
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:38,079
different

3193
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:41,920
uh weed from different states and and

3194
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:44,158
living in oaxaca and the the plants that

3195
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:47,359
were being grown there which were just

3196
01:43:44,158 --> 01:43:49,439
amazing uh and and those are kind of of

3197
01:43:47,359 --> 01:43:52,319
uh

3198
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:52,799
pot that i really love and and makes me

3199
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:55,679
fee

3200
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:57,039
feel really good so again for me i think

3201
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:57,920
moving into the future there's a lot of

3202
01:43:57,039 --> 01:43:59,840
things that we can do

3203
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,118
a lot of synergies that we will find

3204
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,199
especially like right now i

3205
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:04,719
i just love the fact that cookies is

3206
01:44:03,198 --> 01:44:07,919
putting mushrooms

3207
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:08,800
in with their cannabis products i just

3208
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,319
think that's

3209
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:12,159
you know we'll see where that goes it's

3210
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:15,118
really interesting to me but

3211
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:16,399
again the key for me is is keeping it

3212
01:44:15,118 --> 01:44:18,639
natural

3213
01:44:16,399 --> 01:44:20,079
keeping it close to the earth and not

3214
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:22,400
getting too far

3215
01:44:20,079 --> 01:44:23,359
into that whole pharmaceutical model

3216
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:26,319
right

3217
01:44:23,359 --> 01:44:26,960
yeah nice so ethan i know that you think

3218
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:28,880
about these

3219
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,639
you know synergistic products a lot with

3220
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:33,679
credo science that you founded

3221
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:36,319
um what's your vision of the future sure

3222
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:37,679
well in addition to internal projects uh

3223
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:41,439
we're really moving now

3224
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:43,840
into formulation our our whole ethos is

3225
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:47,198
to make cannabis safer and better

3226
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:49,679
uh but also to extend it out uh

3227
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:52,000
into combinations with these other

3228
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:55,440
plant-based medicines and fungal-based

3229
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:58,479
medicines um and i very much uh

3230
01:44:55,439 --> 01:45:00,960
in tune with what jeff said uh we want

3231
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:04,079
this to be done in a holistic

3232
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:06,719
clean manner organic preferably

3233
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:07,198
through regenerative agriculture so

3234
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:10,560
we're

3235
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:12,960
absolutely in support of those endeavors

3236
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,400
right on so bring us home tony i know

3237
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,399
you are a big thinker

3238
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:17,439
and kind of an alchemist philosopher i

3239
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:19,519
hope i didn't put too much

3240
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:21,519
on you right there but like what what do

3241
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:23,520
you see as a formulator for the

3242
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:26,400
direction that we should be going

3243
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:28,000
so i kind of subscribe to um what the

3244
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:30,638
panel's saying i really think what

3245
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,920
burner said is well said as well as jeff

3246
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:36,400
and and and ethan i i subscribed to that

3247
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,039
my mission since 96 when i got on this i

3248
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:40,638
was started

3249
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:43,840
at 16 and 18 i had my own personal

3250
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:45,679
experiences with uh different types of

3251
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:48,719
things that were prescribed to me

3252
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:52,158
that once i found cannabis in the herb

3253
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:53,520
i got upset and i realized that we don't

3254
01:45:52,158 --> 01:45:54,879
you know not every condition in the

3255
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,199
world with the things that you touched

3256
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:57,920
on

3257
01:45:55,198 --> 01:45:59,039
in the general basis you know people

3258
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,760
need their sleep

3259
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:03,198
people have anxiety people have pain

3260
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,719
people have digestion

3261
01:46:03,198 --> 01:46:06,238
there's amazing breakthroughs with other

3262
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:07,920
types of conditions but

3263
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:11,359
those are the four main major things

3264
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:14,000
that's going on my mission since 1996

3265
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:15,118
was to get people off of synthetic

3266
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:19,039
opiate-based

3267
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:22,399
products and synthetic drugs that

3268
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:26,800
we can bring plant-based medicine into

3269
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:29,679
a pharmacopia level of

3270
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,480
of of grade so i always think of

3271
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:31,520
plant-based

3272
01:46:30,479 --> 01:46:33,439
but how do we do this at a

3273
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,880
pharmaceutical level to where people

3274
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:37,039
will take it serious enough

3275
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,000
and understand and like just hearing

3276
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,238
what he said about

3277
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,600
the capsule is why i do what i do you

3278
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:43,678
know it affects me

3279
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:46,480
as a person and it's like why i do what

3280
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:49,520
i do because i just want to be able to

3281
01:46:46,479 --> 01:46:51,839
positively influence as many people

3282
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:52,560
i think this panel in this type of

3283
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:55,920
synergy

3284
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:58,320
is going to do tremendous education but

3285
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:00,079
ultimately that's that's the next move

3286
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:01,840
for the next generations like we start

3287
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:03,198
getting caught up in synthetics

3288
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,960
we start getting caught up in

3289
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:07,919
artificially trying to create

3290
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:09,359
experiences and things in life we're

3291
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:12,560
going to lose ourselves

3292
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:14,238
and so that's for me the mission is

3293
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:17,119
plant-based

3294
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:18,879
cool thank you i like i like how tony

3295
01:47:17,118 --> 01:47:21,039
finished with uh

3296
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,079
suggesting that this synergy that we

3297
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:24,479
have created here

3298
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:26,079
um all experts from different fields and

3299
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:26,799
i think i think that's a beautiful thing

3300
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:28,719
so

3301
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,960
in wrapping up so let's first we'll uh

3302
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:33,920
we'll thank all the speakers

3303
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,158
