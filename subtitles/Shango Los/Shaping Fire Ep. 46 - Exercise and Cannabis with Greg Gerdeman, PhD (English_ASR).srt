2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:09,329
as more and more athletes come forward

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,638
as using cannabis for training and

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,798
recovery many regular folks who exercise

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,320
to stay fit are considering adding it to

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,300
their health plan as well exercise in

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,679
cannabis are not obvious friends since

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,868
many people assume that when you use

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,759
cannabis you sit on the couch and eat

10
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:26,219
all the snacks and while that's

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,949
certainly a possibility many more people

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,108
are up and motivated hiking or working

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,750
or surfing or reading or writing or even

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,850
taking care of the kids the idea of the

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,759
couch locked stoner is really more of a

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,620
stereotype than an actuality the

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,750
inspiration for this episode came from

18
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,488
the movie American Beauty in that film

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,259
the Kevin Spacey character is going

20
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,419
through a midlife crisis and he turns to

21
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,488
cannabis weightlifting and fantasy to

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,020
get him through it he says that he's

23
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:54,119
working out because he wants to look

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,489
good naked and I think many of us

25
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,169
identify with that it got me thinking

26
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,628
about the relationship between cannabis

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,820
and exercise I wanted to understand if

28
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:05,338
cannabis and exercise were complementary

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,519
I wanted to know if cannabis could help

30
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:10,379
all of us look better naked if you want

31
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,030
to learn about cannabis health business

32
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,530
and technique efficiently and with good

Shango lows today my guest is Greg

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,680
Germann

55
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,020
Greg tournament is a neurophysiologist

56
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,360
with expertise in the endocannabinoid

57
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,859
system he has received research support

58
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,359
from the National Institute on Drug

59
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,009
Abuse and the National Science

60
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,739
Foundation and his articles have

61
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,810
appeared in the journals such as natural

62
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,098
science trends in neuroscience and

63
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,020
neuropsychopharmacology

64
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,449
his research while an assistant

65
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,530
professor of biology at Eckerd College

66
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:15,359
included the molecular physiology

67
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,849
of cannabinoid receptors and their

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
evolution within neural systems Gregg is

69
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,269
presently chief scientific officer at

70
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,209
three boys farm in Florida

71
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,040
welcome to the show Gregg thank you

72
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,959
thanks for having me against anger yeah

73
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,849
it's so great to have you back so so

74
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,069
let's start off with a quick summary of

75
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,709
the endocannabinoid system for folks

76
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:36,329
because while you know certainly more

77
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,939
people know that they have an

78
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,760
endocannabinoid system then used to know

79
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,709
it's still pretty new to a lot of folks

80
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,060
and honestly since you haven't got a

81
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,069
history of being a professor you're

82
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,019
actually really darn good at teaching it

83
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,519
so so let's start there so that we can

84
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,950
build on that throughout throughout the

85
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,069
show so so will you summarize what the

86
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:58,829
human endocannabinoid system is and and

87
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:01,139
how we want to work with it yeah of

88
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,719
course thanks for the compliment and

89
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,779
more people do know for sure having

90
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:10,080
talked about this for many years but the

91
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,860
endocannabinoid system is really how the

92
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,769
endocannabinoids work and we this was

93
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,440
discovered out of a quest scientific

94
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,659
quest to understand how cannabis works

95
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,489
in the body of course all of that was

96
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,340
mostly biased towards how it's bad and

97
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,519
hurt you and is wrong but even with that

98
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,430
bias we discovered the endocannabinoid

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,709
system which is intrinsic to our body as

100
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:41,099
a mechanism for resilience I believe and

101
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:44,430
in homeostasis the endocannabinoids as

102
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:46,919
players in our body can be called sort

103
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,540
of like the body's own THC or

104
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:53,369
cannabinoids they are if you're familiar

105
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,769
with with molecules at all they're

106
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,890
they're lipid molecules they come from

107
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:02,400
the membranes of cells not just in the

108
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,219
brain but all over the tissues of the

109
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:11,099
body and act at certain receptors in

110
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:13,500
order to dampen excitation and they do

111
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,409
many different things but on the basic

112
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,720
level we've got these endocannabinoids

113
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:22,370
called an and amide and to AG there are

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,950
molecules that act in many ways like THC

115
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:29,949
they act at receptors that are on cells

116
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:33,039
and they include cb1 and cb2 cannabinoid

117
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,899
receptors this is sort of a guest

118
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,629
tradition or if you will endocannabinoid

119
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:40,689
system those endocannabinoids and the

120
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:42,399
cb1 and cb2 receptors we now know it's

121
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:46,600
quite a bit more complicated than that

122
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:49,079
and this is a system that your body uses

123
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,660
all the time to regulate metabolism

124
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:57,399
motivated behavior the synchrony and

125
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:59,620
rhythms of your brain in fact you know

126
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,000
many people will know that when all of

127
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,730
this was discovered it was hugely

128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,839
surprising to brain scientists people

129
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,710
like me who study receptors and how

130
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,669
drugs and hormones and neurotransmitters

131
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:14,349
work because the cb1 cannabinoid

132
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,800
receptor when it was discovered way back

133
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:21,730
in 89 and then in more thoroughly in

134
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,579
1990 we discovered that it's the most

135
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:29,640
abundant receptor system in the brain by

136
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:33,279
far so our brains - really highly highly

137
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:35,349
evolved to respond to cannabinoid

138
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,779
signaling you know of course we were

139
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,640
evolved with the endocannabinoids in our

140
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,139
body but the cannabinoids that cannabis

141
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,110
has been with us a very long time as

142
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:46,360
well so so if we're looking at the

143
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,509
endocannabinoid system as our body's

144
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,949
master regulator you know constantly

145
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:53,439
trying to bring us back to homeostasis

146
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,159
like you said or or it bring us back to

147
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,800
balance

148
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,410
if we're running hot in a category it

149
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,939
will help bring us bring it down and

150
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,950
bring it back to bring us back to center

151
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:05,110
if we're if we're if we're cool in a

152
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,569
category or slow or stagnant in the

153
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,189
category well it like amps it up so no

154
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:13,290
matter if you're high or low it's

155
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:16,029
bringing you back to you know best

156
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,680
best-case scenario for your body well

157
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:20,799
this makes a lot of sense then right

158
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,949
that this this body master regulator

159
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,670
would be impacted and might be an active

160
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,529
participant

161
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,509
every time we exercise right because

162
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:31,359
we've got we've got breathing and blood

163
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,800
flow and muscle sets and you know all

164
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,259
you know adrenaline and all these other

165
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,569
things that are playing a role in

166
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:40,810
exercise they're also playing a role in

167
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:46,329
the endocannabinoid system so so how

168
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:49,209
does cannabis help us work with the

169
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:51,759
endocannabinoid system generally when we

170
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,689
exercise what what are we doing when

171
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,209
we're interacting with the

172
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:59,649
endocannabinoid system generally when we

173
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:01,389
exercise well you know I I'm part of

174
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:04,209
what I think is so exciting is how much

175
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:05,919
we have yet to learn and that now these

176
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:08,109
kinds of questions are something we can

177
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,449
ask out in the open and really explore

178
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,280
it and with today's cannabis that we

179
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,399
haven't were able to understand the

180
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,439
diversity of it but you know from a

181
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,259
starting point what we've come to find

182
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,850
out and work that I did it was part of

183
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:24,879
this but other group many other groups

184
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:27,340
have shown that when you exercise your

185
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,350
body elevates its endocannabinoid levels

186
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,889
that's one of the kinds of activities

187
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:35,500
that can increase circulating levels in

188
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:40,539
the blood of an and amide at least as an

189
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:43,439
endocannabinoid and so there's part of

190
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:47,110
the benefit the physiological benefit of

191
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,209
aerobic exercise but it's also been seen

192
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,490
with resistance training and an amide

193
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:54,849
levels go up and to the effect that

194
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,620
there's sort of analgesic effect a

195
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:01,360
euphoric effect it may help to motivate

196
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:04,149
behavior in the first place this is all

197
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,600
just something that is intrinsic to to

198
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:09,189
how our exercise physiology evolved and

199
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,050
you're right the physiology of exercise

200
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,969
is a really unique case I mean skeletal

201
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,290
muscle and fat tissues and depth of

202
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:19,810
breathing and so much goes on during

203
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:22,900
exercise that is special compared to how

204
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:26,470
our bodies normally work and and that's

205
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:28,929
because the human being in our hominid

206
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:33,460
ancestors we evolved that of a lineage

207
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:35,500
that evolved to be exercisers and the

208
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:39,639
endocannabinoids system I believe was a

209
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,779
key part in what made that happen I'm

210
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,299
really on this idea that

211
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:45,699
endocannabinoids actually a part of the

212
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,309
evolved ability of these sorts of

213
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,720
processes let's let's take a little

214
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,789
deeper in that because when we were

215
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,910
chatting before you know as we were

216
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:54,990
setting up this interview today

217
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,549
I thought I thought it was really

218
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,810
interesting you're talking about the the

219
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:03,689
evolution of humans as a as a running

220
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:06,389
animal right as a running being and how

221
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,450
essential and integral the

222
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:11,730
endocannabinoid system is to that kind

223
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,528
of of long-distance running mean one of

224
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,659
the reasons humans could get meat is

225
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:17,879
that because over time they would run

226
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,350
down these animals that might be faster

227
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,689
but they didn't have the same stamina

228
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,040
that we had right right so so so why

229
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,690
don't want you to riff on that a little

230
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,389
bit because I think you've got some

231
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,790
interesting stuff there yeah they're

232
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:32,759
they're hunter-gatherer groups in Africa

233
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:36,208
you know to this day that hunt with sort

234
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,350
of persistence or exhaustion techniques

235
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:43,649
well like just like you said band of of

236
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:48,000
hunters can basically jog and antelope

237
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:50,009
down to exhaustion and for that but for

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,320
that kind of behavior to evolve would

239
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,899
have been a multi-step process over time

240
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,778
you look back tens of thousands of years

241
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:01,799
to when our hominid ancestors were

242
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:04,679
largely in trees or near them there was

243
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:07,740
a big shrinking of the forests of East

244
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:10,620
Africa and areas where Homo sapiens

245
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,730
evolved so that you got the development

246
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:16,019
of these big savanna grasslands and

247
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:19,139
whether it's hunting to exhaustion or

248
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:23,009
just foraging from place to place it's

249
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:24,838
it was adaptive so the field of

250
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:26,759
biological anthropology you know

251
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,640
believes this these aren't controversial

252
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:32,129
things I'm talking about it was a those

253
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:36,600
those ancestors who were better at

254
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:38,820
running were more successful whether it

255
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,019
was hunting or following a vultured or

256
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,910
something have been killed or just

257
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:46,769
getting to a better place to forage

258
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,539
endurance running was adaptive and so

259
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:51,230
traits that favoured endurance running

260
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:54,659
were adaptive and you see in in humans

261
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,879
skeletal muscular features like the

262
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:58,620
length of the Achilles tendon in certain

263
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,088
ways that the head and the hips sit in

264
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,649
their sockets in the length of the femur

265
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:06,900
that make running less energetically

266
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,209
demanding well

267
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,500
what would have motivated that behavior

268
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,940
in the first place because running

269
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,629
intrinsically increases your risk

270
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,120
predators of injury and and the

271
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:21,480
endocannabinoids fit in nicely as an

272
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,039
explanation in that when you engage in

273
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,440
the behavior and you get sort of a

274
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,329
runners joy out of it from increased

275
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,640
circulating endocannabinoids your sense

276
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,379
of wellness improves the taste of the

277
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,409
food you found is actually better

278
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:36,539
because of the endocannabinoids this is

279
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:39,480
all well steeped in research and similar

280
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,189
to how cannabis can affect you it would

281
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,769
have promoted behavior a culture of

282
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:48,260
behavior and that is a positive feedback

283
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:52,319
loop driving we believe the evolution of

284
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:54,899
humans to be you know quote unquote Born

285
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,550
to Run endurance runners and the

286
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,079
endocannabinoids are really involved

287
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,959
they don't just get activated when

288
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:06,000
you're from exercise but the way they

289
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:09,778
stimulate the appetitive food seeking

290
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,730
they help to desire and promote feeding

291
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:14,490
and that's something that goes way back

292
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:18,149
to deep evolutionary time even very

293
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:21,870
simple organisms like worms and Hydra

294
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:24,720
that are pre jellyfish are or have an

295
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,060
endocannabinoid system that seems to in

296
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,220
their interact with the control of

297
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:30,929
metabolism and feeding behavior that's

298
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,820
where our endocannabinoids system

299
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:38,458
evolved from but in vertebrate animals

300
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:42,209
that of course you know include mammals

301
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:44,489
became mammals became humans if the base

302
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:46,889
of the vertebrate family tree what we

303
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,549
call invertebrate chordates that's when

304
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:53,189
these cb1 and cb2 cannabinoid receptors

305
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:55,259
seem to have evolved and it only there

306
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,410
do you start to see a DNA sequence

307
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:03,139
that's like the cb1 cannabinoid receptor

308
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:06,719
and lo and behold in the timespan of

309
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:09,809
evolutionary development vertebrate

310
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,490
animals have these systems what's what

311
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:13,289
is special about a vertebrate animal

312
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,950
what an evolutionary biologist will

313
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:18,990
identify hat they have identified what

314
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,520
we call vertebrate innovations that

315
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:24,060
appear in our lineage and know

316
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:28,289
and they are including a peripheral

317
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:34,019
nervous system a very incredibly complex

318
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:37,139
and and large head and brain an adaptive

319
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,509
immune system that recognizes previous

320
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:44,970
you know threats and responds admit

321
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:47,100
remembers them these are things that the

322
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,649
endocannabinoid system is all about

323
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,950
regulating it is the endocannabinoids

324
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:55,889
and the cb1 and cb2 receptors are master

325
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:59,520
regulators of metabolism inflammation

326
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:02,330
the immune response and regulation of

327
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,039
the complex brains and nervous signaling

328
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,570
then that's not you know counter that's

329
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,240
not cannabis culture talk that's this

330
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,950
mainstream science get that dando

331
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,870
cannabinoid system is the master

332
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,830
regulator of physiology and you don't

333
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:20,460
see that talking in other literature but

334
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:23,070
you I could I can go on about this

335
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,870
connection you know well let me let me

336
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,400
point yeah let me point you in in a

337
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,899
continued direction because I like what

338
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,899
we're talking about because the you know

339
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:33,809
basing the endocannabinoid system in

340
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:37,379
this this long history of human

341
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:40,649
evolution I like how a it takes it out

342
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:42,840
of drug culture and like stoner culture

343
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:47,819
and and even out of science right

344
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:50,430
because science is often trying to like

345
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,230
pure medical science is often very on a

346
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:55,309
pedestal right but when you get to

347
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:58,019
evolutionary science and anthropology

348
00:14:55,309 --> 00:15:00,839
suddenly things get a lot more visceral

349
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:04,289
right and and a lot a lot less cherished

350
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,509
and so so so going back to what you were

351
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:08,569
saying I love the beauty of the idea of

352
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:11,909
you know the endocannabinoid system

353
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:14,790
appears in us as as our DNA starts to

354
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:19,439
become more human and then part of that

355
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:21,750
is that we we when we when we say when

356
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,900
we spark the endocannabinoid system it

357
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,929
creates a state in us that we enjoy food

358
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:30,110
and we're also chasing our food so so

359
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:33,209
not only is the endocannabinoid system

360
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,080
modulating our running experience and

361
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,590
giving us that

362
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:41,070
joy but also we're chasing down our food

363
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:43,590
so that we can get more complex fats to

364
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,900
build our brain and oh yeah once you get

365
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,090
there and you capture the animal and you

366
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,029
eat it your your your endocannabinoid

367
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:53,639
system is already like primed for a

368
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:55,350
fantastic meal and and how that comes

369
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,199
together it's just frickin beautiful

370
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:01,800
right it's like ah it's like hell yeah

371
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,900
major it's beautiful because it teaches

372
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,269
us more about who we are and at

373
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,039
something I I like to say a lot that the

374
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:10,319
science of cannabis has taught us much

375
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,120
more about how cannabis works it's

376
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,310
taught us a great deal about the biology

377
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,649
of who we are and what it means to be

378
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:18,839
well but jumping into your scenario yeah

379
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,490
you run there's there's a control whole

380
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,800
of your metabolism and your and your

381
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,039
repetitive Drive but guess what has also

382
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:28,500
been very cleanly and repeatedly shown

383
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,659
in various animal research models the

384
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,529
endocannabinoid system helps to

385
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:36,719
stimulate neurogenesis it you're not

386
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:39,120
only collecting fats to feed your brain

387
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,170
you're stimulating mechanisms that

388
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,960
promote the growth of the brain that

389
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:48,769
help to create resilience to the

390
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,259
anxieties of life by promoting healthy

391
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:53,939
regeneration of nervous tissue which we

392
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,860
know does happen throughout life and

393
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,380
there's been lots of studies showing

394
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,139
that cannabinoids stimulate neurogenesis

395
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:04,349
including plant cannabinoids including

396
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:06,230
as a consequence of exercise and it

397
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,939
doesn't happen if you block the cb1

398
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,279
cannabinoid receptor even some some

399
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,670
under cited research that I really like

400
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,709
by a group in Germany a friend of mine

401
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,100
Susanna Wolfe was first author one of

402
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,740
these papers they a difficult experiment

403
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:25,469
to do giving animals an enriched

404
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,359
environment over a period of time you

405
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,930
know you may a lot of listeners may be

406
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:33,779
familiar with sort of this rat park

407
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:35,700
literature about a lot of well a lot of

408
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:38,970
animals are not housed in a in a good

409
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,529
situation and in research it's kind of

410
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,660
deprived and when you give animals

411
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:44,399
enriched environments there are lots of

412
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,019
measures of health benefits there and

413
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,030
for example they're not as likely to be

414
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,049
you

415
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:51,420
self-administering cocaine and that kind

416
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:53,519
of thing but the point here is Susanna's

417
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,320
work was that she did a very long

418
00:17:53,519 --> 00:18:00,139
controlled experiment that's hard to

419
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:02,849
fund and found that animal enriched

420
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,030
environments stimulated neurogenesis

421
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:07,889
greater rates in in brain areas where it

422
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:10,680
occurs they hippocampus of the mouse

423
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:13,259
brain and that this was blocked in

424
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,049
animals that had cb1 receptors blocked

425
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,390
either with genetically they didn't have

426
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:19,980
it or they were blocking it with

427
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,790
chemical antagonist so back to the

428
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:27,210
running thing we know that over the

429
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:31,829
history of hominid evolution leading to

430
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:34,799
almost ap ins ourselves as greater

431
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:37,199
running mobility occurred in the fossil

432
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,559
record and Accor the course of evolution

433
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,350
as species became more mobile and better

434
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,099
runners their brain size also increased

435
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:49,559
their head size their brain size and

436
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:53,399
this makes sense from a natural

437
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:56,940
selection perspective in that as an

438
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,490
animal as a species is getting better at

439
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,049
running your survival demands are

440
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,210
different you're better at foraging

441
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:07,190
you're getting more metabolic support

442
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:10,529
but the complexity of the environment

443
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,090
moving traveling farther covering more

444
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:15,240
different terrains at different rates

445
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:18,419
your processing speeds you need for

446
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,670
processing speed is greater to be able

447
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,970
to see changing environments remember

448
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:25,500
your environment have flexibility to new

449
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,940
encounters that you're more likely to

450
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:33,059
have and so the evolution of humans as

451
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,220
were to be runners also included a

452
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:38,099
growth in the brain and endocannabinoids

453
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,990
we know are stimulated by running and we

454
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,869
know that endocannabinoids are linked to

455
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,150
neuro trophic factors and things that

456
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:48,659
cause increased neurogenesis we see it

457
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:50,100
we know the mechanism so part of the fun

458
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,570
about talking about evolution is it is

459
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,919
always going to be speculative right

460
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:56,220
because it's something you've had that's

461
00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:00,080
happened in the in the past but then the

462
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,970
pieces are really beautiful to make this

463
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,789
perspective and support this perspective

464
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,910
that the endocannabinoid system helped

465
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:10,609
to support the evolution of who we are

466
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:14,890
as runners and the metabolic activity

467
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:18,129
that we have some of the thinking on

468
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:20,870
exercise and metabolism is that you know

469
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,430
Western community Western society is

470
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:26,359
dealing with such issues related to

471
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:29,570
metabolism diabetes obesity

472
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:32,539
you know sedentary lifestyles and we

473
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:34,669
evolved not only to be runners but our

474
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:37,309
metabolism evolved with a running sort

475
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:43,100
of set point there that were kind of

476
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:45,619
hard it plumbed to burn through calories

477
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:48,409
like we're running and if we don't have

478
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:51,109
exercise in our life that extra calories

479
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,300
that you want to intake because you're

480
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:56,149
just set to that it ends up going to

481
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:58,129
inflammation yeah and and when we run an

482
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,310
exercise end up that's another thing oh

483
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:04,760
by the way yabba noids clearly do they

484
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:07,039
dampen down inflammation and so yeah I

485
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:10,339
look I love the whole area and it does

486
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,289
support how natural cannabis medicine

487
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:14,839
you know as a complement to that

488
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:15,859
physiology is but it's not just about

489
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,199
cannabis it's about understanding

490
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:20,659
ourselves and how an active mobile

491
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,460
lifestyle is healthy it's how we evolved

492
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:28,820
and there's it it's it's a natural thing

493
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,759
to do you know I I work with patients a

494
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:33,710
lot around the country and you know

495
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,779
often I'll get people saying you know I

496
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,519
want to use cannabis because I am

497
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:42,470
insomnia right and we can talk all about

498
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,509
you know you know using THC short-term

499
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,850
and CBD to make the sleep cycle better

500
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:48,529
all that but I always start with are you

501
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:50,990
drinking coffee in the morning right

502
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,789
because because if you're if you're

503
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,370
drinking coffee in the morning the

504
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:57,079
caffeine half-life means that when you

505
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:59,419
go to sleep you still have active

506
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,669
caffeine in your body even if you only

507
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,140
had one cup and of course no one wants

508
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,880
to hear that right no one wants to

509
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,930
chimeric no one wants to give up their

510
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,700
cup of coffee

511
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,410
to get rid of their insomnia they want

512
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,630
to keep their cup of coffee and then

513
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,410
they want to you know take some kind of

514
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,560
purple flowered cannabis

515
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,390
to help you know slow them down at night

516
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:20,309
similarly to use your example you know

517
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:22,560
people are often you know you know why

518
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:24,629
do I have endocannabinoid deficiency or

519
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,359
why is it so common you know and and of

520
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,220
course we go through the the the modern

521
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,379
American things you know you know stress

522
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,870
poor sleep poor nutrition too many

523
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,330
pharmaceuticals environmental toxins but

524
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:38,489
really it's that lack of mobility right

525
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:40,859
you know like our bodies are designed

526
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,650
over you know generations and

527
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,569
generations to be mobile to do physical

528
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,940
work to take in calories to burn them

529
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:50,970
off and now we're you know driving our

530
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,920
cars and sitting on the sofa and I mean

531
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,900
hell I most of the time I'm working I'm

532
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,240
either like standing up talking to

533
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,460
people or I'm sitting at my computer or

534
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,769
on a plane sitting at a computer night

535
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,569
and and you know I'm one of those people

536
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:09,359
we all need to get more mobile and I

537
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:11,939
like what you said how you know cannabis

538
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,699
teaches us more or reminds us more where

539
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,400
we came from right because it's showing

540
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,630
that okay if if modern life is not

541
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,220
working for most everybody what what can

542
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,290
we learn about how thing we used to live

543
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,440
that can help us be helped healthier now

544
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:31,559
yeah yeah and you know a health and

545
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,779
fitness is not you know all about

546
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,970
endocannabinoids this we you know we can

547
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,950
sometimes get get into but in no

548
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:41,279
cannabinoids are a master regulator and

549
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:43,170
and I think it's it's legit to say that

550
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,359
you know the endocannabinoid system has

551
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,240
been under sort of a multi-pronged

552
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,129
attack with the modern that is to say

553
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,210
you know Western lifestyle with all the

554
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,800
things you're saying sedentary ISM and

555
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,809
not having as many leafy greens that

556
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,450
will support a healthy microbiome and

557
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:01,470
probably healthy fatty acid balances

558
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,559
that help to generate the

559
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,750
endocannabinoids themselves the quote we

560
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,609
know chronic stress wears down the

561
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,710
endocannabinoid system it's makes sense

562
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:12,750
and though cannabinoids are a buffer

563
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,930
against stress but when you beat up your

564
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,359
buffers you run you render a high and

565
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:21,120
you know that's a metaphor but promoting

566
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,449
a health and and and well-being from an

567
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,409
endocannabinoid perspective I think is a

568
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,120
exciting direction

569
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:31,390
- I certainly like looking at it that

570
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:33,039
way right on so so in our second set

571
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,310
we're gonna start talking specifically

572
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:40,059
about how cannabis can help us with with

573
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:42,190
different types of you know exercise and

574
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:45,129
athleticism but before we go to the

575
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,570
first commercial break I want to go you

576
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,720
know all the way back to where we

577
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:51,939
started this set because you talked a

578
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,370
little bit about how cannabis can help

579
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,279
motivate us towards exercise right and

580
00:24:54,369 --> 00:25:01,359
and you know we've laid out this case of

581
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:03,970
that that we do need movement and and if

582
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,039
we move our endocannabinoid system will

583
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:08,829
reward us with all of this you know

584
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:12,279
increased health and thriving nature but

585
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:15,339
I know I'm not the only one who you know

586
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:17,440
I'm I'm busy and I travel and I don't

587
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:18,759
find the time for as much exercise I

588
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,610
want to even though you know I

589
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:24,519
continually am getting better at it I'm

590
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:26,259
not there yet but but I liked what you

591
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:29,400
said though that there are aspects of

592
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:33,879
using cannabis that can help motivate us

593
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,740
towards exercise when that is not the

594
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,360
general belief right most people are

595
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,150
thinking about local you know lazy

596
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,189
sedentary stoners and certainly there

597
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,650
are other factors that play role you

598
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,230
know a role in that but but what but why

599
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,240
don't you tell us a little bit about how

600
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:52,900
cannabis can help move us closer to

601
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,809
exercise and so that maybe you know some

602
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,330
of us can get a little more motivated

603
00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:01,419
yeah well I mean I think that that's

604
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:02,710
very true and it's gonna in my view the

605
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,840
way we're talking about it cuz of course

606
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,910
we can talk more later that there's a

607
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:08,859
lot of talk about you know cannabinoids

608
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,590
in terms of recovery because of an

609
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:13,389
anti-inflammatory values and having an

610
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:15,990
anti-inflammatory a little on board

611
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:18,160
ahead of time exercising unnatural one

612
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,329
may be beneficial but we're talking

613
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:25,570
about motivation and we're talking about

614
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:28,449
that kind of sort of effect I think

615
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:33,759
we're probably talking about using it in

616
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:35,200
low doses prior to exercise and maybe

617
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,839
it's because you just learned that it

618
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,519
helps you get in a zone helps you less

619
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,740
be less

620
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,799
attached to other distraction so you can

621
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:47,740
focus on it one of the ìiî certainly

622
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,089
spoke I remember 20 years ago talking to

623
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,740
someone when I was first getting into

624
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:55,480
this research a scientist I was with at

625
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,690
Vanderbilt said yeah you know we I used

626
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,700
to be with this running club out in

627
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,710
Eugene Oregon and we would all take

628
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,179
edibles like half an hour before we ran

629
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,450
then we'd all like you know we'd go on

630
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:09,009
this like 12 mile run and he was like it

631
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,440
totally helped me get in the zone and

632
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:13,000
I've heard that many times now it's been

633
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,970
much more popular as a lot of ultra

634
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,460
athletes talking about that now but

635
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:21,220
whether it's that or even you know not

636
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:23,829
just a long-distance zone where you need

637
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:28,450
to sort of wear away the hours while

638
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:30,250
you're exercising there there may be

639
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,660
just a way to sort of let loose of

640
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,400
what's holding you back and you know I

641
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,540
think about in terms of weight room

642
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:40,050
training and that kind of exercising

643
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:44,200
where you might be self-conscious about

644
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:44,859
form or what your performance is how

645
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,529
much

646
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:52,509
something's weights or rattling and and

647
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:54,789
I think of judicious use of cannabis can

648
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:57,190
maybe help you get past that that your

649
00:27:54,789 --> 00:28:00,339
own you what your own resistance is

650
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,929
holding you back like I was related when

651
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:04,269
I was talking to you earlier about hand

652
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:06,790
drumming which is something I I love to

653
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:08,349
do and have trained in and a lot of

654
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:10,029
times what holds you back from making a

655
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:12,428
great rhythm is yourself it's your

656
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:14,829
inhibition from actually making the

657
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:16,990
impact and with the drum and just

658
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:19,629
feeling it and I think the same thing is

659
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:23,490
getting in with the training I mean it's

660
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:28,630
like if you're if you're training you

661
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:30,880
and trying to get over a hurdle there's

662
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,830
a value to being coached through it and

663
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,400
and that's because it helps release sort

664
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:39,039
of your you're descending neural

665
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,230
pathways that put a little safety check

666
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,940
on your own actions and get coached

667
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,099
through something you can you're able to

668
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,660
push through a little harder and I'm not

669
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:49,000
trying to go too far about what I know

670
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,400
that endocannabinoids or cannabis does

671
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,720
or doesn't do but I like to think about

672
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,210
the idea that

673
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,910
having a little bit of cannabis on board

674
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:01,360
can help you to get past your own

675
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:03,580
resistance and sort of negative body

676
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:06,789
type or whatever and just do it and then

677
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:09,399
maybe maybe with experience then going

678
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:11,710
to the gym or your whatever your

679
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,650
training situation is taking that little

680
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,000
bitty and I am I do tend to say that

681
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:20,800
this would be what we'd call a micro

682
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,630
dose just a small little dose can even

683
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,730
kind of be a conditioned experience like

684
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,580
yeah okay there's my exercise zone let's

685
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:30,009
get this yeah well said you know during

686
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:32,559
the during the introduction I talked

687
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:35,379
about that that great scene in the movie

688
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,960
American Beauty where the Kevin Spacey

689
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,060
character you know he's having you know

690
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,069
all sorts of life problems right but but

691
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,899
to kind of reclaim his life one of the

692
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:46,599
things he decides to do is he gets a he

693
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,580
gets a weight bench and he's starting to

694
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:50,799
smoke some weed again and he's putting

695
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:54,039
on some of the music that energizes him

696
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,349
and you know I get that man you know I

697
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:58,960
know that if I get too high then then

698
00:29:56,349 --> 00:30:00,279
you know using resistance by doing the

699
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,319
resistance training at the gym or

700
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:04,119
something like right being at the gym is

701
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,679
too weird and bright and I just don't

702
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,149
want to be there but but if I just have

703
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,250
like you know a little hit off my

704
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,900
one-hitter right or for many people that

705
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,630
would be a vape pen like nowadays right

706
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,790
just that little bit it kind of loosens

707
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,000
up the fact that I generally don't want

708
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:21,009
to be there lifting weights and and

709
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,779
suddenly I'm like alright I'm here and

710
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:25,029
I'm in I'm in a much better mood than I

711
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,740
was a couple minutes ago let's get going

712
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:29,230
and it kind of gets me over that initial

713
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,870
hump of oh my god I got these all these

714
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,339
other things I should be doing but you

715
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:36,250
know cannabis for a lot of people makes

716
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:38,199
you very you know emotionally present

717
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,119
with where you are and I find that's

718
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,680
really the only way that I can work out

719
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:46,119
is if I forget the rest of my life that

720
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,970
you know acts as a distraction all this

721
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:50,259
stuff I should be doing and you know you

722
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,430
know and most of the stuff we're talking

723
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:53,019
we're gonna be talking about today is

724
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,910
gonna be tincture based but for me

725
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:58,900
specifically with lifting you know a

726
00:30:54,910 --> 00:31:01,390
little a little in inhaling followed by

727
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,590
some some weight training that that

728
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,990
really works for me and I think it does

729
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:07,119
for a lot of people yeah where's for me

730
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:10,089
I dig it and

731
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,158
I laugh a little bit about the American

732
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:14,319
Beauty reference because my buddy Mike

733
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,820
who got me back into training a couple

734
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,648
years ago and I'm in the best shape that

735
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:20,259
I've been since college and them and

736
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:21,908
I've been happy about that and it

737
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:25,619
doesn't always involve a little bit of

738
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:28,769
cannabis but it usually does and it's a

739
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:32,079
he laughed at me and refer to that exact

740
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:33,700
exact clip when I you know came to him a

741
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:35,859
couple years ago it was just like I'm

742
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,019
not happy with how I look and he jokes

743
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:39,398
cuz that character you know was asked

744
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:41,079
like why what are you trying to hit were

745
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,428
you trying to run certain you know eight

746
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,769
miles or whatever he's like I just want

747
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:48,038
to look good naked

748
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:50,649
hey look good but you know public health

749
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:54,250
and epidemiological studies have shown

750
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:57,428
that overall cannabis users tend to have

751
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:59,109
better lower body mass index you know

752
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:00,880
it's not that we are fatter and lazier

753
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:02,609
and actually so germane to this

754
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,960
conversation Shango you know a paper

755
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:08,379
just got it's not even fully released

756
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,389
but it was announced as a pre release by

757
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,110
group out of Colorado and Ken Hutchins

758
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:16,240
says one of the senior authors who did a

759
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:18,548
online survey amongst people using

760
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,138
cannabis and legal states had something

761
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:23,288
like six hundred respondents and the

762
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:26,408
questioning was do you endorse the use

763
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:28,538
of your cannabis around exercise and a

764
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:32,490
large majority I believe it was

765
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:35,319
approaching around 80% of cannabis users

766
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:38,200
associated it with helping them or

767
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,480
endorsing it without exercise more of

768
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,830
them were relating it to the recovery

769
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,599
phase but a significant number I look

770
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,970
forward to reading the actual paper a

771
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:51,339
significant number did discuss it in

772
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,919
just the way that you and I are that it

773
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:56,798
helped to to motivate them or support

774
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,419
their performance in some way and and

775
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:00,819
you know I was at a panel on the Emerald

776
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:02,889
cup in December with some great athletes

777
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:05,678
and they too were you know across the

778
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:08,798
field a lot of a lot of athletes do you

779
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,380
feel like there's a benefit to whether

780
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:14,168
its flow state or something of that

781
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,429
whatever you want to call it you and I

782
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:18,100
have just been talking about it in terms

783
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:19,980
of alright I'm there I'm ready to go and

784
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:23,009

833
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,050
bit of CSI humble gen-x last year here

834
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,940
on Vashon Island and everyone was

835
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,340
pleased the patients had beautiful

836
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,858
female plants and didn't have to call

837
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:22,050
half of their garden as males the folks

838
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:24,179
growing for the fun of getting high grew

839
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,880
colorful flowers with exceptional bag

840
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:29,009
appeal and great highs and breeders had

841
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,780
seven out of seven females in a pack

842
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,760
which gave them a lot of phenotypic

843
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:37,480
choices take a moment right now and

844

00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:47,530
descriptions

848
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:49,119
that's humbled CSI comm now that the

849
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:50,320
health benefits of terpenes have become

850
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,420
well-known in the cannabis industry

851
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,090
people everywhere are looking for the

852
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,829
purest terpenes without adulterants the

853
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,539
problem with most terpene providers is

854
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:00,340
that they're not sourced naturally and

855
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:02,529
instead are made as a byproduct of

856
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,289
refining petroleum and that's so sketchy

857
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,300
the terpenes sold by true terpenes are

858
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:10,239
entirely different they are certified

859
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,860
organic non-gmo and food grade that

860
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,289
means that they are extracted from real

861
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:16,510
plant sources there are no solvents of

862
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:19,449
any kind they are distilled only with

863
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,910
steam that's right only steam in fact

864
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:24,099
terpenes from true turbines are so pure

865
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:25,899
that you can eat them not only that but

866
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:28,779
you can stack them with better results -

867
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,849
what I mean is other company's terpenes

868
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,680
have got a few percent of impurities and

869
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:34,750
when you stack those terpenes to make

870
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:36,549
your blend you're adding a variety of

871
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,250
impurities that degrade your final

872
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,170
product true terpenes also have strange

873
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,000
specific terpenes for a wide range of

874
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,360
cannabis strains like Durbin poison

875

Shango Louis and our guest this week is

900
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:45,009
gregor demon chief scientific officer at

901
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,960
three boys farm so before the break we

902
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,089
were talking a lot about

903
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,829
the historical significance of the

904
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:54,639
endocannabinoid system and how we

905
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:57,250
evolved as mobile human beings and then

906
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,348
a little bit about motivation because as

907
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,929
we all know you know getting motivated

908
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:03,430
to exercise in the first place is you

909
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:06,129
know is a challenge for a lot of people

910
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:08,949
including me so then this set we're

911
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:11,079
gonna talk more about the impact the

912
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:13,719
interplay between the human

913
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:16,150
endocannabinoid system cannabis and

914
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:18,250
exercise and and and how they're working

915
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:20,710
together - I don't know build a better

916
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:24,088
human so so Greg why don't we start

917
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:27,220
there you know specifically how does

918
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:33,460
supplementing our body with cannabis

919
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:35,289
help us strengthen and build muscle well

920
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,699
that's tough I mean you know I'm a

921
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:38,108
scientist so I'm always gonna back up

922
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:42,489
and say well we're not totally sure

923
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:43,929
about that but it there's the

924
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:46,479
cannabinoid system in working with

925
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:49,299
cannabis in that it can help support

926
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,699
better you know metabolism and storage

927
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,769
of fats may may help and here's another

928
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:55,960
piece that's pretty mysterious is that

929
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:58,150
we now know that there are cannabinoid

930
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,750
receptors actually on mitochondria that

931
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:05,230
are the AP generating powerhouses of the

932
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:07,150
cell right that's really weird that

933
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,010
there's a neurotransmitter receptor

934
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,338
that's on the surface of neurons and all

935
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,990
over the body and it's also found on

936
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:16,358
mitochondria that's part of what makes

937
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:18,608
this receptor system so different and

938
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:21,358
it's it's literally a mechanism the

939
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:23,679
endocannabinoids system is not just a

940
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,960
system like here's a group of

941
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:29,108
cannabinoid producing cells and they

942
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:31,150
project everywhere that's like the case

943
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:32,949
we're talking about dopamine I can point

944
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,838
to every dopamine cell in the brain and

945
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:36,939
it they project everywhere but there's

946
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:39,159
the dopamine system right there the

947
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,190
endocannabinoids system is more like an

948
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:44,379
endocannabinoid mechanism that is a

949
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:47,829
fundamental cellular mechanism

950
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,150
it's all over the body so in when it

951
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:52,568
comes to exercise and you're talking

952
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:55,358
about building muscle I mean there's

953
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:57,369
certain aspects that well and though

954
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:00,639
cannabinoids may be involved in sort of

955
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:02,559
the healing of you know micro tears and

956
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,778
that kind of thing that is involved in

957
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,400
building muscle mass but here's

958
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:09,369
something I want to go into that that

959
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,380
you haven't heard from me yet it's a

960
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:15,278
recent study came out that I got I'm

961
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:17,588
really excited about that looks at how a

962
00:40:15,278 --> 00:40:20,130
no cannabinoids and cannabinoid

963
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:23,409
receptors work at the at the

964
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,510
neuromuscular Junction so the

965
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:27,489
neuromuscular Junction is where and when

966
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:30,028
you're doing any voluntary movement

967
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:32,469
moving a hand finger a foot there are

968
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:35,139
neurons that are coming called motor

969
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:37,239
neurons from your spinal cord really

970
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:38,798
comes from your motor cortex down to

971
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:41,439
your spinal cord and then your spinal

972
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:43,719
cord sends motor neurons to your muscle

973
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,150
and the release of neurotransmitter

974
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:47,889
called acetylcholine at that

975
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:50,740
neuromuscular Junction is what causes

976
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:54,868
your muscles to contract a move so

977
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:58,358
that's the neuromuscular Junction and

978
00:40:54,869 --> 00:41:00,700
whereas we know that cannabinoid

979
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:02,920
receptors and endocannabinoids act at

980
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:06,009
connections between cells and the brain

981
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:08,798
synapses like practically every synapse

982
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:10,838
in the entire human brain is impacted in

983
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:14,500
some way by endocannabinoids if not

984
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:15,880
using it on the regular studies of the

985
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,670
neuromuscular Junction have been less

986
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,470
obvious but a study just came out

987
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,170
recently it was in the journal

988
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:25,239
scientific reports just in the last

989
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:29,068
couple months showing that

990
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:33,608
endocannabinoids are released by

991
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:36,489
contracting active muscles and travel

992
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:39,578
backwards and hit the neuromuscular

993
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:40,778
Junction in this similar way that it

994
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:46,329
does in the brain that I hope to

995
00:41:40,778 --> 00:41:47,650
describe like 2001 but in the brain

996
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:50,048
there's a key difference here in the

997
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,210
brain endocannabinoids travelling

998
00:41:50,048 --> 00:41:53,798
backwards dampen the release of

999
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:56,710
neurotransmitters and kind of slow

1000
00:41:53,798 --> 00:41:59,170
things down at the neuromuscular

1001
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:01,838
Junction where physical activity is

1002
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:05,278
stimulated the endocannabinoids actually

1003
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:08,730
increase the level of neurotransmission

1004
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:11,048
they and this was a study done in mice

1005
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,369
but there were some really key findings

1006
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:14,590
first of all that they used they showed

1007
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:16,570
it a synthetic cb1 egg and

1008
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:20,860
did this as well I wish they had used

1009
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:23,920
THC but such as big animal research they

1010
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:26,530
didn't but nonetheless they mimicked it

1011
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,079
with a cannabinoid agonist activator and

1012
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,850
it increased at a very very heavy

1013
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,039
research I mean they're like counting

1014
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:35,319
vesicles of neurotransmitter released

1015
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:38,320
basically they show that at that level

1016
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,059
it's increased it's kind of the inverse

1017
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,370
of what happens in the brain but why

1018
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:45,369
would this be adaptive I mean maybe this

1019
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:48,519
is an ability part of the ability of

1020
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:51,279
exercising muscle tissue to to overcome

1021
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:54,159
fatigue you just start increasing the

1022
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,960
release of the how effective the motor

1023
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,359
neuron is driving the muscle I mean the

1024
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,880
the the cellular physiology of fatigue

1025
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,800
and why it happens is not so obvious and

1026
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,710
maybe this is a break for understanding

1027
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,390
in that regard but secondly they looked

1028
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:09,699
at a mouse model of a disease called

1029
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:11,400
myasthenia gravis are you familiar with

1030
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:14,109
this at all no I'm not

1031
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:19,630
myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune

1032
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:22,809
disorder and it manifests with muscle

1033
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:27,700
weakness that can and clumsiness related

1034
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:29,920
to that that's a short version you get

1035
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:31,899
muscle weakness because again it's

1036
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,170
autoimmune where the body is developing

1037
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,960
antibodies to the receptors for

1038
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:41,050
acetylcholine that respond to the

1039
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,940
neuromuscular Junction okay so you're

1040
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,740
you develop antibodies they attack your

1041
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:48,220
own receptors that you're in a muscular

1042
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:50,109
Junction so the efficacy the tightness

1043
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:52,629
of connection between your spinal cord

1044
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,550
telling your muscles to move is degraded

1045
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,769
by your own immune system it's one of

1046
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,519
these insidious that ways that

1047
00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:00,489
autoimmunity

1048
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:03,039
[ __ ] us up in people that have

1049
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:04,779
myasthenia gravis well it is something

1050
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:08,199
that is very easily modeled in a mouse

1051
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:11,019
you can make a mouse basically allergic

1052
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:13,059
to their own acetylcholine receptors it

1053
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:15,070
acts just like myasthenia gravis they

1054
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:17,320
get muscle weakness and progressive you

1055
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:19,450
know failures because of that and they

1056
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,030
showed that giving the mouse that

1057
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:25,059
cannabinoid helps to prevent and and

1058
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:26,890
treat myasthenia gravis I mean

1059
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:28,960
clinically if you have this

1060
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:30,759
what you will be prescribed as a

1061
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,278
medicine that helps to enhance the

1062
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,299
release of acetylcholine or block its

1063
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:39,929
breakdown this new discovery is that

1064
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:42,369
cannabinoids acting at cb1 receptors

1065
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:44,528
enhances the release of acetylcholine at

1066
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:46,690
the neuromuscular Junction right there

1067
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:49,210
it's here's another of the limitless

1068
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:50,650
examples about cannabis we have I cannot

1069
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,019
stand up in front of a group of doctors

1070
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,380
and talk about clinical data and say

1071
00:44:53,018 --> 00:44:58,058
that there's any proof whatsoever that

1072
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,760
the use of cannabis be it a tincture a

1073
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:03,250
pill a joint I cannot say that the use

1074
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,299
of cannabis can be a treatment for

1075
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,849
myasthenia gravis

1076
00:45:04,298 --> 00:45:07,420
I have literally zero clinical evidence

1077
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:09,940
for that

1078
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:12,659
but the biological underpinning has now

1079
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:17,019
been elegantly described that it may be

1080
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:19,420
the case and I'm hoping that in this era

1081
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:22,689
of new upstart cannabis companies that I

1082
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:26,769
am involved in these kinds of things can

1083
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:28,869
be dub tailed into studies you know if

1084
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:30,489
not really expensive clinical trials

1085
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:32,680
patient outcomes let's recruit people

1086
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:35,348
who are using it for Mycenae gravis and

1087
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:37,268
find out does it work that's

1088
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:39,130
observational study it's not as strong

1089
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:41,139
it's a controlled clinical trial but

1090
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,430
they all start to justify one another

1091
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:45,308
yeah and if we move in that direction

1092
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:49,000
will be easier for us to to fund those

1093
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:51,309
increased in size studies and you know

1094
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,318
this is interesting too because well I

1095
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:56,200
don't have a lot of experience with that

1096
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:57,548
particular autoimmune disease I work

1097
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:59,588
with a lot of other folks with

1098
00:45:57,548 --> 00:46:02,768
autoimmune disease most commonly usually

1099
00:45:59,588 --> 00:46:05,078
lupus and and you know a you know how

1100
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:06,578
how these manifests for different

1101
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:08,650
patients kind of is different from

1102
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:10,930
patient and patient but but decreased

1103
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:15,400
mobility is incredibly common right and

1104
00:46:10,929 --> 00:46:21,068
so and and we find that high doses of

1105
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:23,318
whole plant cannabinoids really work to

1106
00:46:21,068 --> 00:46:25,329
help I've heard patients call it loosen

1107
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:28,389
the joints right if to make them feel

1108
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:30,160
less like they're they're rusting like

1109
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:31,838
the Tin Man and Wizard of Oz right they

1110
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,940
feel like they're loosening and while

1111
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,308
I've never heard this explanation that

1112
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:38,858
you get just gave it certainly seems to

1113
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:39,740
be more evidence in that general

1114
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:43,608
direction

1115
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:45,500
that that you know adding cannabinoid

1116
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:49,130
supplementation to our body from this

1117
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:53,088
plant acts like an oil can on everything

1118
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:54,800
that's trying to stop our mobility it

1119
00:46:53,088 --> 00:46:59,259
sure seems to act in a lot of places

1120
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:02,960
like that yes they there's a a

1121
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:05,750
redundancy of function that helps to

1122
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,429
support these different directions that

1123
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,349
would enhance mobility and you know this

1124
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:12,618
piece I'm talking about if it could

1125
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:14,539
cannabinoids help to increase the the

1126
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:17,599
function of your neuromuscular Junction

1127
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:18,679
on this subtle way but a way that could

1128
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,369
underlie it when people were talking

1129
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:25,069
about getting into a flow state maybe

1130
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:28,880
that's part of it your neuromuscular

1131
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:31,880
connection is just getting set up and

1132
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,760
more you know high fidelity and you feel

1133
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,289
it then you've got the sense of wellness

1134
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,570
that comes from the way the

1135
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:40,670
endocannabinoids are acting in the

1136
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:42,640
limbic system of your brain and you've

1137
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,630
got the sense of enhanced

1138
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,299
bronchodilation that's happening from

1139
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:50,960
endocannabinoids working on your upper

1140
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,640
Airways and and it's it all fits

1141
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,940
together in some pretty fascinating ways

1142
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,929
then and then yeah it certainly does in

1143
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,639
a matter of fact I'm thinking to myself

1144
00:47:56,929 --> 00:47:59,779
I'm like my god this is like a big

1145
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,710
commercial for yoga

1146
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:06,019
you know like low the low-impact muscle

1147
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:09,230
movement of that kind creating you know

1148
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:10,460
an increase of endocannabinoids let's so

1149
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:12,230
let's circle this all the way back

1150
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,449
around to the strengthening and building

1151
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:18,050
muscle before we move on to different

1152
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:20,539
types of athleticism so you know at its

1153
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:23,240
you know I don't know a lot about a

1154
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:24,920
sports physiology but my general

1155
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,598
understanding is that how we're building

1156
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,900
muscle is that we rip the muscle and

1157
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:32,269
then as as our body goes to repair that

1158
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:34,490
it repairs it you know bigger if you

1159
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:36,769
will and so you're building muscle mass

1160
00:48:34,489 --> 00:48:38,500
and then so you know you rip it today

1161
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:41,119
you heal tomorrow you rip it today so

1162
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,869
that that's clearly something that is

1163
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:47,300
going to be partially regulated by the

1164
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:49,490
endocannabinoid system how will you know

1165
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,380
that having the canvas to help us be

1166
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:53,189
present in the moment is good and to

1167
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,750
focus so that we can lift more

1168
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:57,960
wait and have better form that's all

1169
00:48:54,750 --> 00:49:01,230
good but at that at the muscular level

1170
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,900
how will this support our building and

1171
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:05,730
strengthening of muscles well I don't

1172
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,039
know that it will I mean honestly and

1173
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:11,219
and you know that ripping and tearing is

1174
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:14,279
is you know an intrinsic part of that

1175
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:16,409
does include inflammation and I have

1176
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,050
talked to a sports physician who has

1177
00:49:16,409 --> 00:49:21,539
expressed to me that he thinks the

1178
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:25,170
anti-inflammatory actions of the

1179
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:27,630
cannabinoids actually would be working

1180
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:31,050
against bulking up and really if your

1181
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:38,640
weightlifting to build mass that that

1182
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:41,130
may be contrary I I don't know I've I've

1183
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:43,440
got a little observation into my own

1184
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:47,480
holes articles on use of cannabis

1185
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:52,740
related to strength training and I don't

1186
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:55,440
you know I I shouldn't even say but at a

1187
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:57,629
molecular level we don't really know and

1188
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,309
me talking about what happens at that

1189
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:02,910
neuromuscular synapse is not really

1190
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:06,719
addressing how the tissue is remodeling

1191
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:09,389
during the recovery and that can help

1192
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,189
build mast maybe there would be an

1193
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:14,818
interference I don't know how important

1194
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:19,019
inflammation is to the actual mass

1195
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:21,059
building that goes on but it's it's an

1196
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:24,199
interesting question because because if

1197
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:26,789
we need some inflammation in the area

1198
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:28,108
maybe we don't need as much as we have

1199
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:31,409
because you know a lot of people love

1200
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:34,769
cannabis for recovery right and so may

1201
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:37,739
be okay we we rip up the muscles and

1202
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:41,608
which causes its repair and inflammation

1203
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:44,669
but maybe if the cannabis is decreasing

1204
00:50:41,608 --> 00:50:46,500
inflammation X variable amount maybe

1205
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:49,680
that's where we're getting some of our

1206
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:52,349
ease of recovery from these sports yes I

1207
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:54,358
think so but you know again cannabis

1208
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:56,039
isn't just a endocannabinoid system

1209
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:58,828
isn't just a master regulator of

1210
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:01,880
inflammation it's so much broader than

1211
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:05,490
that and in many vascular beds

1212
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,550
endocannabinoids act as vasodilators now

1213
00:51:05,489 --> 00:51:10,289
that's

1214
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:13,720
may not happen all the time but it

1215
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:14,349
vasodilation is something that is taken

1216
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:16,059
I mean

1217
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:20,500
supplements that is that are for example

1218
00:51:16,059 --> 00:51:23,739
nitric oxide donors are taken by weight

1219
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:27,338
lifters to improve the amount of weight

1220
00:51:23,739 --> 00:51:29,618
you can go the circulation of of

1221
00:51:27,338 --> 00:51:32,108
oxygenated blood to the tissues is

1222
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:36,599
enhanced may be cannabis does that add a

1223
00:51:32,108 --> 00:51:40,630
level that is not exaggerated but

1224
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:42,580
supportive of sustained muscle function

1225
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,950
during training and I mentioned

1226
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:46,569
cannabinoid receptors on mitochondria I

1227
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:49,210
mean the other kind of supplement that

1228
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:54,369
is really used to boast both performance

1229
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:56,740
and and recovery or are supplements like

1230
00:51:54,369 --> 00:52:01,390
creating phosphates and things that will

1231
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:03,189
support the regeneration of ATP if and

1232
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:05,199
this is certainly conjecture in my part

1233
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,929
but if the cannabinoid receptors on

1234
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,759
mitochondria are involved with making

1235
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:11,440
mitochondria more efficient maybe that

1236
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,020
has something to do with replenishing

1237
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,929
ATP that's a very testable question that

1238
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:18,400
I don't think anybody has gotten to yeah

1239
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:19,779
well I certainly haven't seen anything

1240
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,329
on it and that actually leads us right

1241
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:24,730
next to our other our next category of

1242
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:28,059
sports which is endurance right so if

1243
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:34,240
we've got receptors on the mitochondria

1244
00:52:28,059 --> 00:52:36,880
we know that the the the efficiency of

1245
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:39,189
the creation and burning of that energy

1246
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:46,119
is going to be some way related to the

1247
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:47,559
endocannabinoid system yeah right take

1248
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:49,930
that as a baton I wasn't sure exactly

1249
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:51,429
yeah so so so let's talk about running

1250
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:54,009
and swimming right I mean we clearly

1251
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:58,509
talked a lot about running at the top of

1252
00:52:54,010 --> 00:53:02,830
the show but these you know by our using

1253
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:04,839
cannabis how do you see that for runners

1254
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:09,730
and swimmers to add to their overall

1255
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:12,730
training regimen well I mean I just

1256
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:16,659
think if it if it improves their

1257
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:19,329
experience and their adherence to the

1258
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:20,299
discipline of their sport then it's

1259
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:24,309
going to have

1260
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:26,300
the benefits of sticking with it and and

1261
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:29,179
it could be of great help

1262
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:32,140
I I some of this could be this aspect of

1263
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:37,429
getting in the zone or combating fatigue

1264
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:39,559
that cannabis can be involved with and

1265
00:53:37,429 --> 00:53:43,609
like I'm saying there's lots of cellular

1266
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:47,750
molecular basis for that the metabolic

1267
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:50,539
benefits that may happen with using a

1268
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:53,210
way of using cannabis and in your life

1269
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:56,360
around training may help to support the

1270
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:58,429
kind of changes that again help to seats

1271
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,740
shift you to a different set point and

1272
00:53:58,429 --> 00:54:04,549
we're not my training partner now we've

1273
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:07,129
talked about exercise as a vision of

1274
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:09,980
homeostasis I mean you push yourself out

1275
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:11,869
of your zone and part of the recurrence

1276
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:15,409
of training to get your time better to

1277
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:17,719
get your endurance better is you're kind

1278
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:20,869
of forcing a homeostasis to a different

1279
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:22,369
set point I mean that my my buddy used

1280
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:23,690
to talk about me hitting the red zone

1281
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:26,359
because I'm telling you when I first

1282
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:28,760
started training in the gym two years

1283
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:31,519
ago again since first time in a long

1284
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,980
time I would work out with my buddy Mike

1285
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:37,579
for like 20 minutes and I would be like

1286
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:41,360
I would be redlining I felt terrible and

1287
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:44,090
the act of continuing to train is really

1288
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,550
pushing your body into that zone which I

1289
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:49,420
do very much believe we evolved to get

1290
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:53,690
into but you know 20 years out of shape

1291
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:55,700
is 20 years out of shape and you have to

1292
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,860
sort of re-engage yourself to be

1293
00:54:55,699 --> 00:54:59,359
adaptive in that setpoint and there may

1294
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,530
be some consequence where you don't feel

1295
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:06,170
so good when you go weeks without

1296
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:07,280
training but that's another you know let

1297
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:10,010
me let me ask this question in a

1298
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,360
different way too because I was I was

1299
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,160
setting you up because I thought you

1300
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:16,010
were gonna tell me that that there are

1301
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:18,349
ways that cannabis can can help the

1302
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:21,410
performance of swimming and running the

1303
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:23,179
actual physicality of doing it and you

1304
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:24,949
went to mindset which makes me think

1305
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:26,769
that maybe my whole direction I was

1306
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:30,049
coming because I thought you you know

1307
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:33,318
cannabis is considered a endurance sport

1308
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:38,298
enhancing drug right and so it

1309
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:40,190
is banned in many sports areas but this

1310
00:55:38,298 --> 00:55:42,858
actually creates this idea in me that

1311
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:45,170
that maybe it's banned not necessarily

1312
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:48,889
because it will make you a better

1313
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:52,338
swimmer do the physical act of swimming

1314
00:55:48,889 --> 00:55:54,920
but maybe the reason why it's sports

1315
00:55:52,338 --> 00:55:57,048
enhancing is just because it keeps your

1316
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,358
head in the game so much more and your

1317
00:55:57,048 --> 00:56:01,369
ability to ignore distractions you know

1318
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:03,920
from the competitor in the next lane

1319
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:06,289
over you know maybe that's it and and I

1320
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,170
was actually yeah huh that's interesting

1321
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:11,499
I I do think so you know like the

1322
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:15,940
n-c-double-a right now it views CBD is a

1323
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:19,218
banned substance of course because it's

1324
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:21,019
right late Schedule one but you know

1325
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:22,190
even thinking cogently about it I've

1326
00:56:21,018 --> 00:56:24,318
talked to a physician with the

1327
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:25,909
n-c-double-a who's you know saying well

1328
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,679
it's an anti-inflammatory and that's

1329
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:30,048
performance-enhancing because

1330
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,058
inflammation that's a wild story because

1331
00:56:30,048 --> 00:56:35,298
we're gonna stop letting people take

1332
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:37,309
ibuprofen beforehand but yeah I mean

1333
00:56:35,298 --> 00:56:38,838
that anti controlling inflammation that

1334
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:43,609
may occur during the course of a

1335
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:45,139
distance sport certainly could help to

1336
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:47,139
promote you know sticking with the

1337
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:50,389
behavior but I think the mental focus

1338
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:52,248
the letting go of grasping you know

1339
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:53,958
there's a whole other dialogue out there

1340
00:56:52,248 --> 00:56:56,208
about cannabis and meditation you know

1341
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:58,159
and and I think there's a intersect

1342
00:56:56,208 --> 00:57:00,498
there and that both are have a

1343
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:03,578
relationship to letting go of your

1344
00:57:00,498 --> 00:57:05,778
grasping of your discursive mind and

1345
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:07,989
that helps with getting into a

1346
00:57:05,778 --> 00:57:11,088
meditative place and it helps with

1347
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:12,920
possibly like you said not thinking

1348
00:57:11,088 --> 00:57:15,108
about the competitor not thinking about

1349
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,180
what you look like or even being able to

1350
00:57:15,108 --> 00:57:18,650
forget the fact that your ankle isn't

1351
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:20,778
feeling very well I mean not like I'm

1352
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:23,150
trying to tell people to push through

1353
00:57:20,778 --> 00:57:26,420
pain that's there and that takes me to

1354
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:29,180
another little piece that you know when

1355
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:33,108
we're talking about why cannabis could

1356
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:36,440
be performance promoting whether it

1357
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:38,328
should be used in sports I was I know

1358
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,338
we're not primarily talking about things

1359
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:43,420
like head injury but I was speaking at a

1360
00:57:40,338 --> 00:57:46,119
conference on traumatic brain injury a

1361
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,369
couple months ago and I spoke to

1362
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:52,599
I mean a fellow who's a doctor he's a

1363
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:57,059
sports physician at a at a NC double-a

1364
00:57:52,599 --> 00:58:00,068
school works with football players and

1365
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:02,079
he he was talking about the use of

1366
00:58:00,068 --> 00:58:05,288
canvas and sports and I won't go down

1367
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:10,839
this whole wormhole but my feeling is

1368
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:13,539
that whether or not cannabis or CBD even

1369
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:15,608
on the sidelines of games could would be

1370
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:18,549
preventing people from serious brain

1371
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:20,548
injury and I think it could I think it's

1372
00:58:18,548 --> 00:58:23,858
more a question of our athletes

1373
00:58:20,548 --> 00:58:26,650
especially in contact sports our

1374
00:58:23,858 --> 00:58:30,298
athletes should have a absolutely right

1375
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:32,470
to be medicating with this medicine

1376
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:34,059
because we should be concerned not with

1377
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:36,338
just getting them back on their feet but

1378
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:38,890
with their longevity as human beings and

1379
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:41,518
I think CBD and full spectrum cannabis

1380
00:58:38,889 --> 00:58:44,618
products should be part should be

1381
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:46,659
allowed and supported but professional

1382
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:48,430
athletics because it helps to promote

1383
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:51,129
the longevity and health and well-being

1384
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:52,598
of the athletes and the question of

1385
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:54,460
whether they can get back on the field

1386
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:57,670
real quickly you know and earn their

1387
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:59,470
paycheck is not the one that the medical

1388
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:01,960
profession should be focused on as much

1389
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:05,439
yeah that's a that's a big cultural

1390
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:09,999
shift to shift our view of of sports

1391
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:12,489
players from entertainers to humans and

1392
00:59:09,998 --> 00:59:15,730
and have some kind of interest in their

1393
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:17,588
in their longevity right yeah totally

1394
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:21,130
and they're like being aware of them as

1395
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:23,710
a human instead of yeah yeah we hang out

1396
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:26,259
with a group of 55 year old NFL players

1397
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:27,999
they're they're nearly near the end of

1398
00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:30,190
their natural life if they were like on

1399
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:32,409
the offensive line those guys don't have

1400
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:35,108
a long life expectancy and a lot of

1401
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:38,980
times even with a lot of wealth it's not

1402
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:40,659
very happy and I don't want to roll this

1403
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,099
up in a whole different conversation but

1404
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:45,399
that is something I feel powerfully

1405
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:46,989
about right on fair enough so so let's

1406
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,548
talk about the the last of the three

1407
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:51,130
categories we talked about strengthening

1408
00:59:48,548 --> 00:59:53,710
and building muscles endurance sports

1409
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:57,608
like swimming and running for myself I

1410
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:59,869
play racquetball and I absolutely know

1411
00:59:57,608 --> 01:00:04,940
that I play differently

1412
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:05,569
with a little bit of THC in my body you

1413
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,119
know

1414
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:10,550
if I if I smoked it it may actually

1415
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:12,589
decrease my my breath a little bit

1416
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:15,560
because I happen to have asthma but I

1417
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:17,720
swear I've got like a sixth sense of

1418
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:21,920
where the ball is gonna go I see the

1419
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:25,849
physics better I attempt and succeed

1420
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,440
more aggressive shots and and so like

1421
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:29,389
what's what's your take on that is it

1422
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,760
just am I getting more creative am I

1423
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:34,159
just more less averse to risk like

1424
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,370
legally what about these dexterity and

1425
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:40,190
mobility based sports where you have to

1426
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:41,989
visualize where a sport action is gonna

1427
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:46,190
take place and then you have grow and do

1428
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:48,529
it it's a the fun part about all of this

1429
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:50,480
is that because the endocannabinoids and

1430
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:53,480
the you know the receptors that cannabis

1431
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,849
works on are so everywhere in the brain

1432
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,190
then you can just think about the

1433
01:00:55,849 --> 01:00:59,690
neuroscience of performance and and

1434
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:01,039
think well cannabis could totally

1435
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:03,530
influence that all the ways you're

1436
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:06,769
talking about whether it influences you

1437
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:09,920
with greater risk taking or sort of

1438
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:11,750
sensory motor visual performance that

1439
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:17,210
said I certainly do have a way to

1440
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:20,570
consider this and that the the neural

1441
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:22,039
circuits in our brain and spinal cords

1442
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:24,160
that are involved with executing motor

1443
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:26,480
behavior or where some of the greatest

1444
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:29,349
expressions that cannabinoid receptors

1445
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:32,860
are and we know that the learning and

1446
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:35,089
unlearning of behavioral habits are

1447
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:37,760
involved involve endocannabinoids

1448
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:40,579
signaling and for example I look at the

1449
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,140
cerebellum the cerebellum is part of the

1450
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:45,980
brain that sits in the back actually the

1451
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:48,440
name means little brain it is anybody

1452
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,960
who studied brain function knows that

1453
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:53,150
the cerebellum is involved with

1454
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:55,220
coordination and timing and and in

1455
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:58,880
clinical symptoms of ataxia various

1456
01:01:55,219 --> 01:02:01,219
forms of ataxia and this coordinated

1457
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,220
symptoms are related to cerebellar

1458
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:07,069
damage the cerebellum what it does on a

1459
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:10,099
neuro circuit level simplified is it

1460
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:12,680
it's constantly processing where your

1461
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:13,309
body is in space like what's actually

1462
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:15,589
how

1463
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:18,349
opening with your body and using input

1464
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:19,910
from what we call proprioceptors if you

1465
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:21,889
close your eyes and raise your hand you

1466
01:02:19,909 --> 01:02:23,539
can feel very much where your body is

1467
01:02:21,889 --> 01:02:25,670
because the proprioceptive input is

1468
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:28,099
telling your brain and it's going

1469
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:29,720
through the cerebellum to do so the

1470
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:31,639
cerebellum is not only constantly

1471
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:34,459
measuring where you what your body is

1472
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:37,250
actually doing but it is comparing it

1473
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:40,340
with what you intend to do and what you

1474
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:44,690
expect to happen and all of these things

1475
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:46,370
like the angle of the racket ball the

1476
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:50,269
angle of the ball coming back off the

1477
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:52,489
wall how you integrate that with the way

1478
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:54,590
the velocity with which you saw it

1479
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:56,959
hitting the wall you know how hard your

1480
01:02:54,590 --> 01:03:00,230
opponent hit it you heard the sound of

1481
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:03,980
it you saw where on the you've got where

1482
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:07,099
it hit you got a memory of how your

1483
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:08,690
opponent throws a wicked spin on it all

1484
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:13,819
of those kinds of things build a

1485
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:16,039
projection in your mind of where that

1486
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,660
ball is going to go and to get there you

1487
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:19,340
have to coordinate what your body is

1488
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:21,859
actually doing with what you're

1489
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:24,920
expecting and what's going on by real

1490
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:28,430
time and again the neuroscience of this

1491
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,930
is very its course is fascinating and

1492
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:31,819
it's very mainstream to think that our

1493
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:34,429
heads and our brains evolved to make

1494
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:35,870
these kinds of computations and the

1495
01:03:34,429 --> 01:03:38,059
endocannabinoids are really involved

1496
01:03:35,869 --> 01:03:41,239
with that in the cerebellar cortex where

1497
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:43,940
a lot of the circuitry is involved every

1498
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:47,659
single synapse is regulated by

1499
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:49,909
endocannabinoids so in that route it's

1500
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:51,889
not surprising and much of the research

1501
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:54,170
has looked at and how does weed impair

1502
01:03:51,889 --> 01:03:57,619
you it's not surprising that high doses

1503
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:59,930
of THC will gum up your coordination

1504
01:03:57,619 --> 01:04:01,849
you know there's absolutely a way to

1505
01:03:59,929 --> 01:04:03,619
overdo it and take so much that your

1506
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:08,989
brain is gonna impact your game

1507
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:12,380
negatively but if a judicious you know

1508
01:04:08,989 --> 01:04:15,099
more micro sort of dosing of cannabis

1509
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:16,940
helps you get in your game and feel that

1510
01:04:15,099 --> 01:04:19,190
there's all kinds of biological

1511
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:23,329
rationale for why that would be the case

1512
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:25,750
and there are forms the very laboratory

1513
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:30,069
controlled cerebellar learning

1514
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:32,320
in animals that are dependent on

1515
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:34,180
cannabinoid receptors to happen

1516
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:37,269
it doesn't happen as well when you don't

1517
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:41,019
have the cb1 receptor and you know

1518
01:04:37,269 --> 01:04:42,460
that's part of the I guess to step back

1519
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:44,050
from that a little bit in segue into

1520
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:47,769
what would be like a broad or sort of

1521
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:50,890
Gestalt of this this conversation other

1522
01:04:47,769 --> 01:04:52,750
conversations I speculate a lot about

1523
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:54,429
how cannabis could enhance performance

1524
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:58,090
because I think the underlying

1525
01:04:54,429 --> 01:05:00,669
neurobiology and physiology is there but

1526
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:02,470
also because there aren't very many

1527
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:05,108
people in the world who worked with

1528
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:07,839
these genetic knockouts earlier than I

1529
01:05:05,108 --> 01:05:09,819
did I'm talking about mice that don't

1530
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:12,519
have can see be one cannabinoid

1531
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:15,519
receptors I've been studying that sort

1532
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:19,630
of genetic study system well I mean i'm

1533
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:21,400
not in the lab 24/7 now but then it's

1534
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:23,950
not about my experience the point is the

1535
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:27,970
data show us over and over again lots of

1536
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:30,098
different labs that and i'm also mammals

1537
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:33,069
that don't have cb1 can have annoyed

1538
01:05:30,099 --> 01:05:35,410
receptors live lives that are shorter

1539
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:38,710
more inflammation prone more seizure

1540
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:41,170
prone more metabolically messed up and

1541
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,909
and again they're prone to early deaths

1542
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:45,780
all these kinds of things and they run

1543
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:50,319
less we know this to cb1 knockout mice

1544
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:55,480
are less prone to running on it on an

1545
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:58,088
exercise wheel so it's part of part of

1546
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,460
how our brains evolved for

1547
01:05:58,088 --> 01:06:02,409
endocannabinoids to be master tuners of

1548
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:05,108
the rhythms of our brain and though

1549
01:06:02,409 --> 01:06:07,269
cannabinoids help to tune them and when

1550
01:06:05,108 --> 01:06:09,009
and where and how the compounds in

1551
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:13,750
cannabis might improve that in a

1552
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:15,520
beneficial way that that has to shake

1553
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:17,588
out empirically you know and if you're

1554
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:19,719
an N of one and using cannabis a little

1555
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:21,639
bit helps you improve your game I think

1556
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:27,219
that is every bit as believable and

1557
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:30,819
justifiable you know explainable as it

1558
01:06:27,219 --> 01:06:32,348
is to say that Louie Armstrong was

1559
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,420
better playing trumpet when he was a

1560
01:06:32,349 --> 01:06:37,240
little bit high for sure you know it's

1561
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:38,349
these kinds of things and and not to

1562
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:40,869
speak for

1563
01:06:38,349 --> 01:06:42,940
a past review musician who we know use

1564
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:45,880
cannabis but I've been around a lot of

1565
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:48,970
musicians in my life who again you can

1566
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:51,070
overdo it but that it also can play a

1567
01:06:48,969 --> 01:06:54,189
role in your motor performance your

1568
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:55,690
dexterity and wet we don't have any

1569
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:57,340
clinical data to say you're gonna be a

1570
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:59,320
better guitar player or racquetball

1571
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:03,130
player by microdose in cannabis first

1572
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:05,559
but this stud this science does help us

1573
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:08,200
understand better who we are and one

1574
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:09,909
thing I've learned from healers of all

1575
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:13,119
stripes whether they are accepted by the

1576
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:15,699
medical establishment or not is that the

1577
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,529
story we tell ourselves matters our

1578
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,969
perspectives on healing matters our

1579
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:21,870
perspective on optimum performance

1580
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:25,089
matters there are systems of our body

1581
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:28,269
that help to promote that that we can

1582
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:32,769
access the endocannabinoid system being

1583
01:07:28,269 --> 01:07:35,619
a master player among them and there's a

1584
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:37,239
plant that helps us interact with that

1585
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:39,130
endocannabinoids system and there's a

1586
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:41,439
reason why it has been revered across

1587
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:44,890
human culture since before human

1588
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:48,519
language beautiful that's a great

1589
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:50,259
wrap-up so let's let's let's pause there

1590
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:52,449
and go to our last commercial break and

1591
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:55,270
then we come back we'll talk about a

1592
01:07:52,449 --> 01:07:56,859
whole bunch of variables to this you are

1593
01:07:55,269 --> 01:07:58,989
listening to shaping fire and my guest

1594
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:02,289
today is gregor demon chief scientific

1595
01:07:58,989 --> 01:08:04,119
officer at three boys farm as a listener

1596
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:05,710
of shaping fire you already understand

1597
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:07,929
the importance of living soil when

1598
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:09,730
growing cannabis when you have active

1599
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:12,009
microbe communities in your substrate

1600
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:13,769
you go way beyond simply fertilizing

1601
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:16,390
with nitrogen phosphorus and potassium

1602
01:08:13,769 --> 01:08:18,699
having active microorganisms in your

1603
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:20,588
substrate supports vigorous plant growth

1604
01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:22,949
throughout the plants root zone making

1605
01:08:20,588 --> 01:08:25,659
for higher yields and thriving flowers

1606
01:08:22,949 --> 01:08:27,309
mammoth pea is the first organically

1607
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:29,349
derived microbial inoculant

1608
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:31,510
that focuses on your plants nutrient

1609
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:33,579
cycling processes to release soil

1610
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:35,409
phosphorus and other micronutrients from

1611
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:38,289
they're bound forms making them more

1612
01:08:35,409 --> 01:08:40,000
available to the plant increased levels

1613
01:08:38,289 --> 01:08:42,130
of phosphorus will also keep internode

1614
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,560
shorter and focus your plants energy on

1615
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:46,569
bud production not only that but the

1616
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,650
microbes act as a defense shield for the

1617
01:08:46,569 --> 01:08:49,659
plants rhizosphere

1618
01:08:47,649 --> 01:08:51,509
by out competing potentially harmful

1619
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:53,430
pathogenic microbes

1620
01:08:51,509 --> 01:08:55,560
pretty cool right mammoth P not only

1621
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:57,298
unlocks the nutrients in your soil but

1622
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:00,029
it also helps protect your plant from

1623
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:03,689
disease mammoth Peas beneficial bacteria

1624
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:06,290
act like micro bio reactors continually

1625
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:08,460
producing enzymes that release nutrients

1626
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:10,680
mammoth P was developed at a u.s.

1627
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:12,480
University has been extensively tested

1628
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,880
by Colorado growers and independent

1629
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:17,969
laboratories mammoth P is proven to

1630
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,440
increase growth and enhance blooming one

1631
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:21,239
of the great things about supplementing

1632
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,889
with microorganisms is that they won't

1633
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:25,439
compete with whatever fertilizer program

1634
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:27,270

chief scientific officer at three boys

farm so greg like let's take the take a

1671
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:05,190
step back from the specifc of sports

1672
01:11:02,369 --> 01:11:07,470
physiology and let's talk about car

1673
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:10,079
avascular help because even people who

1674
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:13,409
are not actively working out or playing

1675
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,699
a particular sport they want to have you

1676
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:17,460
know they want to be heart-healthy if

1677
01:11:14,699 --> 01:11:19,380
you will right and and it's weird you

1678
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:22,020
know you know I've been I've been at

1679
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:25,079
ocher you know pretty much my whole life

1680
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:27,300
I've also been a fan of the Beastie Boys

1681
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:29,369
pretty much my entire life and they've

1682
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:31,020
got this one song we're called heart

1683
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:32,970
attack man and they're talking about

1684
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,620
this guy and and he does a lot of stuff

1685
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:37,140
that I don't do right like he's you know

1686
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:39,269
he's into you know he's drinking a lot

1687
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:41,400
and he's and he's going to you know fast

1688
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:43,140
food and but but but the part that I

1689
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:45,960
always remember is they talked about him

1690
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:47,730
getting high and then playing basketball

1691
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:51,090
and they're waiting for him to drop dead

1692
01:11:47,729 --> 01:11:54,119
on the court right and and so somewhere

1693
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:58,949
you know that got that got put in my

1694
01:11:54,119 --> 01:12:01,890
brain that whenever I'm working out and

1695
01:11:58,949 --> 01:12:03,539
well like like you know and more

1696
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:06,690
endurance stuff and my heart starts

1697
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:08,399
pounding and I'm high I always just kind

1698
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:11,039
of in the back of my mind think I'm just

1699
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:12,750
gonna like drop over dead and I don't

1700
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,489
have any evidence for it and I've got my

1701
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:16,470
been to my doctor and she's all like no

1702
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:19,500
you're not at risk like you're fine and

1703
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:21,270
no she won't approve a stress test for

1704
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,159
me so I can make sure but but she's like

1705
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,690
your there's no there's no one no reason

1706
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:26,519
for you to be concerned about this that

1707
01:12:24,689 --> 01:12:28,109
I'm only but the Beastie Boys and that

1708
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,860
doesn't really get that doesn't get me

1709
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:32,579
anywhere so so let's talk about

1710
01:12:30,859 --> 01:12:34,529
cardiovascular health because that's

1711
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:38,189
like one of the the worst things in the

1712
01:12:34,529 --> 01:12:40,769
United States how can our use of

1713
01:12:38,189 --> 01:12:43,919
cannabis helped us to have healthy

1714
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:47,130
hearts that won't crap out on us well I

1715
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,079
mean if it helps to in ways we've been

1716
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:54,180
talking about to promote exercise

1717
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:55,170
there's a indirect thing but it's I

1718
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,150
certainly don't want to come across like

1719
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:59,399
cannabis being a magic pill towards

1720
01:12:57,149 --> 01:13:01,349
better heart health I there's good

1721
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:04,500
measures I think public health outcomes

1722
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:08,880
from you know survey basis that cannabis

1723
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:14,010
users are are in general tend towards

1724
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:16,800
better health but there there are

1725
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:19,020
concerns around cardiovascular issues I

1726
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,829
mean it it could be

1727
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:24,510
that cannabis this is a weird thing I

1728
01:13:22,829 --> 01:13:28,710
stuttered because this is a place where

1729
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:30,329
the human observation in in what I've

1730
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:33,029
talked about like with better body mass

1731
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:34,500
index for example doesn't exactly line

1732
01:13:33,029 --> 01:13:36,029
up with some of the concerns that have

1733
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,920
been raised in animal research that

1734
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:39,659
there's greater fat deposition for

1735
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,989
example that part of what the cb1

1736
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:44,760
cannabinoid receptor does is not only

1737
01:13:42,989 --> 01:13:47,550
promote feeding behavior but it helps

1738
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:49,579
promote the storage of fats and if the

1739
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:52,199
storage of fats helps to create

1740
01:13:49,579 --> 01:13:55,890
metabolic or cardiovascular risk well

1741
01:13:52,199 --> 01:14:01,349
then maybe that would be some indication

1742
01:13:55,890 --> 01:14:04,020
against high THC for chronic use but we

1743
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:07,770
don't really know it hasn't been in my

1744
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:11,400
view big red flags about cardiac risk or

1745
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:14,310
long term cardiac improvement I'd like

1746
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:15,809
to see more stuff about can't breaking

1747
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:17,039
down cannabis users and controlled

1748
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:19,140
studies and looking at real

1749
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:21,149
cardiovascular performance profiles

1750
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:23,910
whether its heart rate variability or

1751
01:14:21,149 --> 01:14:27,389
ejection fraction and under stress that

1752
01:14:23,909 --> 01:14:30,239
kind of thing I do know that again it is

1753
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:31,920
animal research but a study that was

1754
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:35,869
published very prominently a few years

1755
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:40,050
ago out of Germany showed that and mice

1756
01:14:35,869 --> 01:14:41,159
which do get atherosclerosis and that's

1757
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:43,260
you know like the hardening of the

1758
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:46,590
arteries that is a sort of the primary

1759
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:52,470
risk factor and predictor of larger

1760
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:53,880
cardiovascular disease and in mice with

1761
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:56,400
specially fed a Western diet

1762
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:59,210
atherosclerosis actually absolutely

1763
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:04,889
happens and in mice that were fed daily

1764
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:08,010
really low doses of THC the the severity

1765
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:12,450
of atherosclerosis and plaque formation

1766
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:14,010
related to it was significantly reduced

1767
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:16,349
I mean this was like published in nature

1768
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:19,350
top scientific journal in the world and

1769
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:22,770
it was very low dose it was something

1770
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:24,720
like point zero one milligrams per per

1771
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:27,200
kilogram is very low for an animal study

1772
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:29,490
and and it should produce

1773
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:32,369
atherosclerosis does that mean like a

1774
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:32,960
low dose sort of wellness level regular

1775
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:35,949
cannabis

1776
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:39,289
consumption could help limit

1777
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:41,569
atherosclerosis which is numb leads to

1778
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:42,079
coronary vascular disease number one

1779
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:46,009
killer

1780
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:50,420
am i it might know whether you smoke it

1781
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:52,010
or ingested some other way and it and I

1782
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:54,260
should speak if we're talking about

1783
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:56,680
cardiovascular health about the the

1784
01:15:54,260 --> 01:16:00,470
worry for adverse outcomes in that

1785
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:03,680
smoking cannabis taking THC does lead to

1786
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:05,119
a increased heart rate

1787
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:07,250
you know clinically we'll call it

1788
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:08,300
tachycardia there's a transient

1789
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,979
tachycardia

1790
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:13,159
increased heart rate that happens and

1791
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:15,739
that's part of what supports panic

1792
01:16:13,159 --> 01:16:17,149
attacks when people have taken more than

1793
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:19,789
they were expecting or knew how to

1794
01:16:17,149 --> 01:16:21,379
expect and when that edible starts

1795
01:16:19,789 --> 01:16:23,000
kicking in in the second hour and you

1796
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:25,819
took way too much and your heart starts

1797
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:29,840
racing that as can create a negative

1798
01:16:25,819 --> 01:16:32,829
spiral again it is transient and even

1799
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:36,409
within sort of low dose sessions you'd

1800
01:16:32,829 --> 01:16:40,039
adjust to that but people who have

1801
01:16:36,409 --> 01:16:42,920
emergent cardiovascular disease and/or

1802
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:44,060
maybe at a high risk of stroke for

1803
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:47,659
example because they've already they

1804
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:50,420
know they've got a club the the

1805
01:16:47,659 --> 01:16:53,510
potential for clots if they're taking

1806
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:55,100
medicines for that then they should be

1807
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:58,280
cautious around going too high with tea

1808
01:16:55,100 --> 01:17:02,510
because there are people who can suffer

1809
01:16:58,279 --> 01:17:04,759
a stroke or cardiac incident simply from

1810
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:06,470
having an increased rate you know and

1811
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,300
then that as a side effect it's

1812
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:10,940
something for people recognizing people

1813
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:13,909
even when we first our exercise study

1814
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:17,089
showing that the runners joy is related

1815
01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:18,529
to endocannabinoids signaling I maybe

1816
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:20,750
was you I'd certainly talked to people

1817
01:17:18,529 --> 01:17:23,239
who who asked me you know like all right

1818
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:24,979
so somebody you wanted to get back to

1819
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:26,479
exercise can be happy about it and like

1820
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:28,039
yeah but you know if you're someone

1821
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,649
who's recovering from a heart attack and

1822
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:34,189
you are not used to jogging you don't

1823
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:36,379
want to just boost that with a hit off a

1824
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:39,639
joint and then go run without taking

1825
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:42,250
some consideration even that said I mean

1826
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:44,990
there's not strong clinical data that

1827
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:46,460
people are at increased risks of heart

1828
01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:49,099
attacks but there have been

1829
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:51,140
studies to suggest that patients who

1830
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,910
there have been some clinical findings

1831
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:54,590
of patient with a with stroke with a

1832
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:57,019
heart attack who had been smoking

1833
01:17:54,590 --> 01:18:00,739
beforehand and that caused an effect in

1834
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:02,990
those incidences may be related so um

1835
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:04,309
it's always been my understanding or

1836
01:18:02,989 --> 01:18:05,659
belief I guess because I don't I don't

1837
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:09,820
have a lot of evidence for this is that

1838
01:18:05,659 --> 01:18:13,639
the reason why the heart rate increases

1839
01:18:09,819 --> 01:18:15,590
with smoking THC or or I guess if you're

1840
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,750
taking enough edible but the point is is

1841
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:20,779
that it drops my blood pressure which

1842
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:23,930
causes the heart have to have to pump

1843
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:29,090
faster to make up for the dropping of

1844
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:30,560
the the blood pressure and so so is

1845
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:32,869
there is that is that scientifically

1846
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:36,590
accurate or is that just a myth that I

1847
01:18:32,869 --> 01:18:39,019
grabbed onto oh no that makes sense and

1848
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:41,029
that it can because it vasodilate it can

1849
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:44,090
drop your blood pressure and that can

1850
01:18:41,029 --> 01:18:46,069
create exactly that it with with lower

1851
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:49,579
blood returning to the heart it will

1852
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:54,380
compensate by increasing the rate but it

1853
01:18:49,579 --> 01:18:57,079
also works in the in the autonomic

1854
01:18:54,380 --> 01:19:00,829
control of the heartbeat itself and and

1855
01:18:57,079 --> 01:19:02,989
can create a transient increase in heart

1856
01:19:00,829 --> 01:19:05,269
rate even if you're sitting down which

1857
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:08,779
shouldn't really be accompanied with too

1858
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:11,900
much problems from blood pressure right

1859
01:19:08,779 --> 01:19:13,939
on some people do take you know THC

1860
01:19:11,899 --> 01:19:18,049
based tinctures to lower their blood

1861
01:19:13,939 --> 01:19:20,889
pressure do you think that to get that

1862
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:23,659
lowering of the blood pressure it

1863
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:26,510
necessitates also having the increase of

1864
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:28,819
heart rate I kind of you know I was

1865
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:30,739
under the general idea that that the the

1866
01:19:28,819 --> 01:19:34,699
the the pounding of the heart rate was

1867
01:19:30,739 --> 01:19:37,039
more related to particular terpene

1868
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:40,189
profiles and the excitement of the

1869
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:42,710
adrenals but but then also I know about

1870
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:44,779
this other decreasing of the blood

1871
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:47,720
pressure aspect of it as well so I'm not

1872
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:50,389
really sure how that dynamic works yeah

1873
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:52,070
well I I think if somebody would said

1874
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:53,869
they were sure about it they'd be

1875
01:19:52,069 --> 01:19:55,699
pulling your leg this is complex that's

1876
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:58,220
fair a lot that hasn't been studied

1877
01:19:55,699 --> 01:19:59,720
I like mean you're bringing in the

1878
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:00,429
adrenals on the release of epinephrine

1879
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,789
from there

1880
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:06,969
that could be part of it but no I don't

1881
01:20:03,789 --> 01:20:09,189
think anybody really knows and I - you

1882
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:10,630
know there hasn't been a real well

1883
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:13,210
controlled study that I know of just

1884
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:16,840
looking at changes in resting blood

1885
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:20,500
pressure in people who might be you know

1886
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:23,619
sort of baseline hypertensive but I have

1887
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:26,829
again with just these clinical anecdotal

1888
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:28,779
findings of people who have found

1889
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:30,460
success I've talked to many people over

1890
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:34,899
the years who are like I started using

1891
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:36,340
cannabis for XYZ and my physician came

1892
01:20:34,899 --> 01:20:37,869
back to me and said your blood pressure

1893
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:41,440
is great what are you doing

1894
01:20:37,869 --> 01:20:45,640
keep it ha ha ha ha you know and is that

1895
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:48,488
clinical evidence well you know not at

1896
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:50,260
the standard that that we tend to

1897
01:20:48,488 --> 01:20:52,500
operate when we're talking about

1898
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:55,619
medicines and improving medicines but

1899
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:58,630
it's a clinical outcome that I've seen

1900
01:20:55,619 --> 01:21:02,579
I've heard discussed you know in a

1901
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:06,850
repeated way and I'd love to know if if

1902
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:08,140
cannabis use can increase and lower the

1903
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:12,640
blood pressure of someone who's running

1904
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:15,579
high I'd sure love to help find out who

1905
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:17,590
benefits in that way and and when and if

1906
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:21,309
there if there are variety variations

1907
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:21,969
and terpene constituents that play a

1908
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:25,000
role in that

1909
01:21:21,969 --> 01:21:26,319
that's perfectly conceivable but even

1910
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,039
you know there you get into that whole

1911
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:32,259
new angle of terpenes and all of their

1912
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:36,069
mechanisms of function are far from

1913
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:41,440
clear and in the most part that's

1914
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:43,658
judiciously said things are effective

1915
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:45,849
exquisitely low concentrations a lot of

1916
01:21:43,658 --> 01:21:48,309
times and you know people say things

1917
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:50,500
like oh mercy and helps THC cross the

1918
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:52,210
blood-brain barrier but this is

1919
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:55,119
speculation there's not good data to

1920
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:58,239
show those things so so so far today

1921
01:21:55,119 --> 01:22:00,880
we've talked about using cannabis in a

1922
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:02,639
lot of different ways to help your human

1923
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:06,909
body in a bunch of different ways

1924
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:09,130
similarly cannabis can be ingested by

1925
01:22:06,908 --> 01:22:11,079
different methods right there's there's

1926
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:13,770
there's combustion smoking or a vape pen

1927
01:22:11,079 --> 01:22:16,800
or my favorite tincture

1928
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:21,450
what are your thoughts on you know the

1929
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:23,220
best mode to ingest cannabinoids based

1930
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:25,829
on the the different goals we've been

1931
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:27,570
talking about today yeah I mean the

1932
01:22:25,829 --> 01:22:29,760
bottom line is always gonna be that it

1933
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:32,309
depends on the person and how things

1934
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:36,539
respond and will work well for them but

1935
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:39,350
if you are if you're wanting a rapid

1936
01:22:36,539 --> 01:22:41,369
mode of action you know that maybe it's

1937
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:42,720
certainly if you talk about breakthrough

1938
01:22:41,369 --> 01:22:44,099
symptom control you know we're talking

1939
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,199
about medicine but today we're trying to

1940
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:48,030
talk about performance and again you

1941
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:51,599
know back to our earlier talk you know

1942
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:53,429
if you want to sort of find a place that

1943
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:57,210
you become familiar with that's a good

1944
01:22:53,430 --> 01:23:01,140
zone for your fitness then a fast onset

1945
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:04,590
like a a vape vaping well they've been

1946
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:07,170
flower taking a hit that maybe what is

1947
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:09,569
most effective for you and and if you're

1948
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:11,159
not scared of cannabis it may be the

1949
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:14,340
kind of thing to suggest first because

1950
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:17,099
you can get a better sense of yeah this

1951
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:20,340
is how quickly this works but textures

1952
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:23,400
and sublingual application can certainly

1953
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:25,739
come on pretty fast too and I'm a big

1954
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:28,349
fan and like you said of teachers and

1955
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:31,829
sublingual oils I mean enough they both

1956
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:35,130
for even-even I mean I'm a growing fan

1957
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:38,640
of you know the decarboxylated I mean

1958
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:41,039
the raw acids I think they're highly

1959
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,630
underestimated and and that people could

1960
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:46,019
be popping those and tinctures to great

1961
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:47,909
health benefit whether it would improve

1962
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:49,770
performance not sure but it is a quick

1963
01:23:47,909 --> 01:23:51,630
mode of action and then and then when

1964
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:54,750
you've got again thinking back about

1965
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:57,359
performance and mobility back to my

1966
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:58,859
story of a buddy long ago told me that

1967
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:03,679
you know they would eat edibles and go

1968
01:23:58,859 --> 01:24:09,779
on a run people who have the kind of

1969
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:11,940
sport that involves endurance some sort

1970
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:16,889
of edible product might be what they

1971
01:24:11,939 --> 01:24:19,949
find works to help prolong their zone

1972
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:22,410
their you know flow state if they get

1973
01:24:19,949 --> 01:24:24,779
their block met and maybe through the

1974
01:24:22,409 --> 01:24:26,908
mechanism I mentioned earlier maybe

1975
01:24:24,779 --> 01:24:29,248
there's a way to help

1976
01:24:26,908 --> 01:24:33,179
prevent muscle fatigue or promote muscle

1977
01:24:29,248 --> 01:24:36,898
function so you know it does come down

1978
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:39,569
to what people empirically find works

1979
01:24:36,899 --> 01:24:42,239
for them and and at this point anyway

1980
01:24:39,569 --> 01:24:44,688
and I'd love to I'd love to see a day

1981
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:46,948
where we've got some stronger

1982
01:24:44,689 --> 01:24:50,039
repeatability and then I can give more

1983
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:52,288
recommendations to the naive user but

1984
01:24:50,038 --> 01:24:54,708
right now I would be cautious about it

1985
01:24:52,288 --> 01:24:57,448
right on you know we talk a lot about

1986
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:59,309
individualized medicine on this show

1987
01:24:57,448 --> 01:25:01,589
and I would say that that this feels a

1988
01:24:59,309 --> 01:25:06,719
lot like the same way it's like okay for

1989
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:09,748
me I may like to use a 1 to 1 THC and

1990
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:14,010
CBD tincture for overall endocannabinoid

1991
01:25:09,748 --> 01:25:16,228
health and after workout healing from

1992
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:19,349
from you know running into the wall or

1993
01:25:16,229 --> 01:25:21,149
the racquetball court and all but when

1994
01:25:19,349 --> 01:25:21,989
I'm gonna go lift and I really want to

1995
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:23,609
be in the moment

1996
01:25:21,988 --> 01:25:26,608
well then I'm gonna you know take a

1997
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:30,090
small hit for my one hitter you know of

1998
01:25:26,609 --> 01:25:32,010
a little bubble hat or something and and

1999
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:33,899
I guess that really is it I guess I

2000
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:36,869
guess the the point here is for to

2001
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:38,899
encourage folks to not assume that all

2002
01:25:36,868 --> 01:25:41,728
of these solutions are going to be

2003
01:25:38,899 --> 01:25:44,609
inhaled based and make sure that you

2004
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:46,889
consider the the range of modalities

2005
01:25:44,609 --> 01:25:49,260
that we've got now which is the most

2006
01:25:46,889 --> 01:25:52,019
anybody's ever had in human history yeah

2007
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:54,208
and so don't don't feel like it has to

2008
01:25:52,019 --> 01:25:55,979
be smoking just like when you explain to

2009
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:57,988
patients that they don't have to smoke

2010
01:25:55,979 --> 01:26:00,840
only kind of blows their mind a little

2011
01:25:57,988 --> 01:26:02,698
bit for the first time right now and we

2012
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,979
haven't even talked about topicals in

2013
01:26:02,698 --> 01:26:07,348
this performance piece because that is I

2014
01:26:04,979 --> 01:26:10,708
do tend to think more in terms a very

2015
01:26:07,349 --> 01:26:13,019
local inflammation but there are

2016
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:14,059
different all kinds of different modes I

2017
01:26:13,019 --> 01:26:16,559
mean when we're talking about

2018
01:26:14,059 --> 01:26:19,219
sublinguals I mean some dissolvable

2019
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:24,059
strip might be very effective as well

2020
01:26:19,219 --> 01:26:27,628
but you know it's I'm not gonna go out

2021
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:29,729
proselytizing to people about that

2022
01:26:27,628 --> 01:26:31,889
bringing cannabis and a lot into their

2023
01:26:29,729 --> 01:26:34,079
life is gonna make everything or make

2024
01:26:31,889 --> 01:26:36,090
make it all better but a lot of people

2025
01:26:34,078 --> 01:26:37,828
are using and enjoy it feel like

2026
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:40,150
cannabis increases their quality of life

2027
01:26:37,828 --> 01:26:42,519
and if you want to bring that into

2028
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:45,698
of supporting a physical fitness routine

2029
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:48,640
yeah do that because it might help and

2030
01:26:45,698 --> 01:26:49,750
it's so safe to experiment with think

2031
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:52,600
about don't think that you're just

2032
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:54,670
limited to taking yeah I hit off a joint

2033
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:56,980
before you do it but try thinks you're

2034
01:26:54,670 --> 01:27:00,190
15 minutes before you start working out

2035
01:26:56,979 --> 01:27:02,019
and see it you may don't don't gauge

2036
01:27:00,189 --> 01:27:04,539
whether it's working by whether you feel

2037
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:07,360
high gauge whether it's working with

2038
01:27:04,539 --> 01:27:10,420
whether it you're you worked out well

2039
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:13,000
feel good about it yeah absolutely take

2040
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:14,980
anything away from us to put value on

2041
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,179
the medicine you know by saying oh the

2042
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:18,549
medicine helped me it doesn't take

2043
01:27:16,179 --> 01:27:21,340
anything you helped yourself by using a

2044
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:23,679
plant product that you that works with

2045
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:25,029
how you evolved you know again the story

2046
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:28,449
that we tell each other ourselves

2047
01:27:25,029 --> 01:27:31,420
matters yeah I uh there's a video that I

2048
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:33,669
recently put on the the shaping fire

2049
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:36,010
YouTube channel there's a running a

2050
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:38,279
series there right now the the second

2051
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:40,840
shaping fire sessions I did was with

2052
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:43,658
Ethan Russo the first one with was with

2053
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:46,690
Kevin Chaudhary and and you know Ethan

2054
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:50,649
is very adamant that there is a great

2055
01:27:46,689 --> 01:27:53,919
deal of cannabis efficacy below the

2056
01:27:50,649 --> 01:27:55,839
intoxication mark and so many people

2057
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,300
think that you need to get high to get

2058
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,590
the benefits but you know

2059
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:02,289
anti-inflammatory is a great example you

2060
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:03,940
know serious anti-inflammatory patients

2061
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:05,679
will take two point five milligrams

2062
01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:08,169
every three to four hours throughout the

2063
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:10,569
day and be at work and they've got

2064
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:12,640
active cannabinoids including THC in

2065
01:28:10,569 --> 01:28:15,880
their bloodstream all day long and yet

2066
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:19,300
they don't feel anything yep absolutely

2067
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:22,029
a right on I've learned a lot from Ethan

2068
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:24,429
in that regard and I parrot him quite a

2069
01:28:22,029 --> 01:28:26,800
lot in here in Florida where we've got

2070
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:29,399
you know medical cannabis landscaping

2071
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:32,230
let me tell you it's hard to go to a

2072
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:36,519
dispensary as they exist in Florida and

2073
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:38,709
find those low-dose I mean to be able to

2074
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:42,550
take something really easy at a 2.5

2075
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:44,649
milligram level repeatedly the companies

2076
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:47,710
that play in Florida are more interested

2077
01:28:44,649 --> 01:28:49,599
in higher dose products and you know I'm

2078
01:28:47,710 --> 01:28:51,819
not dismissing high dose and that that's

2079
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:54,310
valuable medicine it's got its place too

2080
01:28:51,819 --> 01:28:58,719
easy so yeah but

2081
01:28:54,310 --> 01:29:02,380
but no exactly you don't have to titrate

2082
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:03,760
the feeling high but to improvement

2083
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:06,279
whether you're talking about symptom

2084
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:09,300
management or in this case we're taking

2085
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:14,309
it to a different level of wellness

2086
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:17,020
performance you know improving you know

2087
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:18,940
functionality and mobility and and open

2088
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:22,030
us live our best self

2089
01:29:18,939 --> 01:29:23,889
oops you know what what do you what do

2090
01:29:22,029 --> 01:29:25,960
you think about these CBD isolate vape

2091
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:28,930
pens that we're starting to see you know

2092
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:30,880
you know sports people you know hitting

2093
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:32,710
on during press conferences and stuff

2094
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,329
you know I mean I know I know that

2095
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:36,609
generally you're a whole plant guy like

2096
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:38,380
I am right that we that you know we want

2097
01:29:36,609 --> 01:29:40,149
to use the whole plant but they're so

2098
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:41,949
invoke and I know that there are people

2099
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:43,479
who are listening to the show cuz

2100
01:29:41,949 --> 01:29:46,179
they're like Oh cannabis and exercise

2101
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:48,039
and then they're sports heroes are like

2102
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:51,130
pushing or being a coming attached to

2103
01:29:48,039 --> 01:29:53,560
these CBD isolate pens but for me I like

2104
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:55,000
I think that I slit you know unless

2105
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,920
unless you're getting your whole plant

2106
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,520
somewhere else and you're just spiking

2107
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:03,550
your your regular daily use with some

2108
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:05,230
extra CBD isolate using CBD isolate on

2109
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:08,560
its own doesn't sound like a great idea

2110
01:30:05,229 --> 01:30:11,469
to me but what are your thoughts I you

2111
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:14,590
know I'm not interested I'm just not

2112
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:16,480
it's see there's I don't want to

2113
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:20,860
disparage any athlete stepping out

2114
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:23,469
supporting CBD in any way and and I I

2115
01:30:20,859 --> 01:30:25,269
I've really enjoyed meeting some great

2116
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:27,550
athletes in the cannabis space and I

2117
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:30,310
praise them for coming out and helping

2118
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:32,230
normalize it because nobody helps to

2119
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:34,690
normalize the conversation and better

2120
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:38,769
than these athletes that we really as a

2121
01:30:34,689 --> 01:30:41,649
society tend to worship you know and and

2122
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:46,720
it's great and CBD is a great compound

2123
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:49,210
you know I it's it's amazing how things

2124
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:51,190
have shifted but tip for us to be

2125
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:53,079
dismissing CBD in any way right because

2126
01:30:51,189 --> 01:30:57,069
CBD is great it's part of the medicine

2127
01:30:53,079 --> 01:30:58,539
but yeah the isolate that that's not

2128
01:30:57,069 --> 01:31:01,079
what I want to be involved in developing

2129
01:30:58,539 --> 01:31:04,960
it's not ever gonna be my first choice

2130
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:07,329
as a product and it's got to be cut with

2131
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,078
other agents because CBD now by that I

2132
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:10,389
mean dilute

2133
01:31:08,078 --> 01:31:12,340
there's something else innovate pin than

2134
01:31:10,389 --> 01:31:14,770
CBD because CBD doesn't stay in solution

2135
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:16,119
very well you know you talk to people in

2136
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:17,469
the business and they'll might they

2137
01:31:16,118 --> 01:31:19,448
might say something like it sugars out

2138
01:31:17,469 --> 01:31:22,480
or it crystals up for what they're

2139
01:31:19,448 --> 01:31:25,658
meaning it comes out of solution and and

2140
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:28,118
that CBD does that very well and so it

2141
01:31:25,658 --> 01:31:29,679
there will be something else added to

2142
01:31:28,118 --> 01:31:32,319
help it dissolve and that's something

2143
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:34,719
you're breathing in and I'm cautious

2144
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:37,539
about that stuff all right again I'm I'm

2145
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:39,908
not trying to dismiss any athletes but I

2146
01:31:37,539 --> 01:31:43,569
also know that cbiit the CBD market is

2147
01:31:39,908 --> 01:31:46,779
booming because there's it's it's cheap

2148
01:31:43,569 --> 01:31:49,808
it's there's huge interest going into

2149
01:31:46,779 --> 01:31:52,509
the production and you know some a

2150
01:31:49,809 --> 01:31:54,309
subset of athletes I mean companies seek

2151
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:58,059
them out to give them these endorsement

2152
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:59,529
opportunities and you know again that

2153
01:31:58,059 --> 01:32:03,489
sounds like I'm speaking negatively

2154
01:31:59,529 --> 01:32:05,500
about them I am NOT but I think it's a

2155
01:32:03,488 --> 01:32:06,549
product not interested right on I hear

2156
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,130
that and that makes sense and I think

2157
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:10,750
that the only reason that CB isolate it

2158
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:13,000
got so hot in the first place is because

2159
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:14,590
it's an artificial market right we've

2160
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,559
got we don't have got federal

2161
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:21,069
prohibition of whole plant and and for

2162
01:32:17,559 --> 01:32:23,380
the moment you know CBD isolate is only

2163
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:25,630
being selectively enforced by the

2164
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:27,789
federal government based on the claims

2165
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:29,289
that you're making from it right so even

2166
01:32:27,789 --> 01:32:30,698
though it's Schedule one they're not

2167
01:32:29,289 --> 01:32:32,019
actually going around the country and

2168
01:32:30,698 --> 01:32:34,210
busting people what they're busting

2169
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:38,020
people is for saying you cannot say that

2170
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:39,939
CBD will solve your whatever your issue

2171
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:41,409
is so right you can't say that but

2172
01:32:39,939 --> 01:32:44,229
they're not busting people for having it

2173
01:32:41,408 --> 01:32:46,388
if if we had federal whole plant legal

2174
01:32:44,229 --> 01:32:49,299
everywhere CBD isolate would just

2175
01:32:46,389 --> 01:32:50,800
disappear because whole plant was so

2176
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:52,510
much more effective but there's

2177
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,210
artificial prohibitions on it and

2178
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:57,639
therefore thus CBD isolate world you

2179
01:32:55,210 --> 01:33:02,289
know right right I think so and there's

2180
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:04,210
so much cannabis a you know column type

2181
01:33:02,289 --> 01:33:06,729
three cannabis varieties hemp varieties

2182
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:08,439
whatever that are CBD producers as you

2183
01:33:06,729 --> 01:33:10,928
know very well there's so much growing

2184
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:12,908
now in North America and part of the

2185
01:33:10,929 --> 01:33:16,989
boom and that CBD isolates because it's

2186
01:33:12,908 --> 01:33:19,569
been imported in mass in huge volumes

2187
01:33:16,988 --> 01:33:21,789
not as helped flower but it's you know

2188
01:33:19,569 --> 01:33:24,250
this first extract sludge that

2189
01:33:21,789 --> 01:33:26,199
from so many different places and gets

2190
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:30,460
then you know we're fine to distill down

2191
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:33,189
into CBD and there's a if for all these

2192
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:35,920
market reasons it exists and me now

2193
01:33:33,189 --> 01:33:38,109
we're living in a space where you know

2194
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:41,170
grocery stores and health food stores

2195
01:33:38,109 --> 01:33:44,500
are talking about cell and CBD products

2196
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:46,329
it's in CVS I think Urban Outfitters is

2197
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:49,060
the last one I read today is gonna start

2198
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:51,220
carrying CBD oils and I hope that they

2199
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:56,350
are oils I had there's so much growing

2200
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:58,420
now and a market to support farmers that

2201
01:33:56,350 --> 01:34:02,230
are you know growing and having a good

2202
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:06,069
farming life that that that whole

2203
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:08,439
spectrum are fuller less less processed

2204
01:34:06,069 --> 01:34:11,099
oils that don't isn't taken down to the

2205
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:15,399
powder and sold around as a molecular

2206
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:20,530
commodity let's keep you know let's keep

2207
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:24,809
cannabis flower in cannabis extract oils

2208
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:28,239
as the health and wellness and

2209
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:31,060
supplement commodity and not just

2210
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:32,559
boiling it down to molecules and I think

2211
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:34,840
I'm you know I'm as classically trained

2212
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:36,670
molecular pharmacology guys you get and

2213
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:38,079
but that's where I stand with it yeah I

2214
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:39,640
totally agree with you and I think that

2215
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:41,619
this is another great place for us to

2216
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,720
plug home growing right like you know

2217
01:34:41,619 --> 01:34:45,369
fight find a keema var that you like

2218
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:48,250
grow it in your backyard or over the

2219
01:34:45,369 --> 01:34:50,859
summer make your own tincture and or

2220
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:55,090
smoke it yourself and know exactly what

2221
01:34:50,859 --> 01:35:00,819
you have I'm never gonna speak against

2222
01:34:55,090 --> 01:35:03,720
home grow by entities that you know want

2223
01:35:00,819 --> 01:35:06,219
to have more of a market control but

2224
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:09,119
whether it's a medicine or you know I

2225
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:11,530
just I think we have a human right to

2226
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:14,079
access this plant and nothing makes it

2227
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:18,369
more accessible than having a plant that

2228
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:21,850
you tan and learning from it so yeah I'm

2229
01:35:18,369 --> 01:35:23,739
not against that right on well Gregg

along with with what he's up to

2246
01:35:53,418 --> 01:35:57,828

2254
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:21,978
things are and why they are not

2255
01:36:19,429 --> 01:36:25,010
naturally occurring cannabinoids and why

2256
01:36:21,979 --> 01:36:27,708
they are so much more dangerous for the

2257
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:29,329
human body compared to naturally

2258
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:30,979
