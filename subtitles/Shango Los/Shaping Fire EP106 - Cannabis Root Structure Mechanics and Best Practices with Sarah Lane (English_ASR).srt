2
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,879
to a lot of roots reggae when I was in

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,439
my early 20s being a stoner in school

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,960
generally meant that there was a lot of

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,939
Reggae around but in my early 20s I

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,160
discovered the band Israel Vibration

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,500
specifically and everything changed

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,560
there are many other bands in The Roots

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,079
reggae genre but for me Israel Vibes is

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,960
the quintessential Roots band for me

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,519
anyway Israel Vibration embodies the

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,259
essence of roots reggae through their

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,899
messages of spirituality social

15
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,820
Consciousness and Liberation their use

16
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,620
of Rich Melodies uplifting chord

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,600
progressions and melodic horn

18
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,878
Arrangements further contribute to their

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,039
quintessential Roots reggae sound

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,218
they address themes such as African

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,780
identity Babylonian system criticism the

22
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,879
struggle of the oppressed and the

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,520
importance of faith and perseverance

24
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,339
Israel vibrations lyrics resonate with

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,600
the poetic nature of roots reggae

26
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,399
encapsulating the struggles and hopes of

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,618
the Jamaican people

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,780
surely I listen to lots of the popular

29
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,938
reggae at the time and these themes

30
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,978
imbue most reggae but I didn't

31
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,319
understand the authentic roots and

32
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:16,019
meaning of Reggae in my soul until I

33
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,539
listened to Israel vibrations

34
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,239
similarly we can talk about the

35
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,180
importance of cannabis Roots a thriving

36
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,780
rhizosphere and root Zone and the love

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,118
of a thick mass of healthy plant roots

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,180
but only when we really lean into Roots

39
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,700
culture cannabis root science well we

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,479
have both the heart and the knowledge to

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,219
grow our best cannabis plants ever

42
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:42,900

I'm your host shangolos

65
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,359
my guest today is plant biologist Sarah

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,939
Lane

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,800
Sarah Lane is wrapping up her PhD in

68
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,680
plant and cellular biology at University

69
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,200
of Victoria her work primarily focuses

70
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,420
on root exudates that are involved in

71
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,119
Iron uptaken plants and their potential

72
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,979
medical benefits Sarah consults for

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,680
licensed cannabis cultivators in Canada

74
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,139
and is an avid living soil cannabis home

75
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,719
grower due to her University Research

76
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:54,119
needs she is also very experienced in

77
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,580
fog panics and hydroponics

78
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,560
Sarah has a wicked large Plant

79
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,239
collection and is currently designing a

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,620
specialty terrarium for growing Cloud

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,200
orchids

82
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,780
Sarah Lane appeared on shaping fire 99

83
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,060
just a few episodes back talking about

84
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,699
the symbiotic relationship between roots

85
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,199
and other residents in the root Zone via

86
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:15,479
exudates

87
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,579
during the first set today we will look

88
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,639
at how roots and root hairs are created

89
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,319
how they absorb nutrients the exudate

90
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,958
relationship and how different

91
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,179
fertilizers impact the root Zone

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,219
the second set is devoted to root

93
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,800
structure we will look at the various

94
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:34,199
forms of root structure in soil cocoa

95
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,580
and hydroponic systems and why they work

96
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,378
and don't work

97
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,379
we will look at the relationship between

98
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:42,239
root structure and the soil food web and

99
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:44,459
we will discuss how various growing

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,620
containers impact root structure and

101
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,420
what that means for your plant and

102
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,519
finally we will finish off with a

103
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,439
discussion of best practices for growing

104
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,799
a healthy and thriving root structure

105
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,500
including water PH soil amendments and

106
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,760
cover crops welcome back to shaping fire

107
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,139
Sarah

108
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,878
thanks for having me I'm happy to be

109
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,518
back so glad to have you you know I

110
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:09,060
don't usually ask guests back right away

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,640
but our discussion of root exudates

112
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,860
during episode 99 just brought up so

113
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,858
many root related questions for myself

114
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,359
and then in the comments online that I

115
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,159
just knew that it was probably better to

116
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,500
just invite you back right away and push

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,600
forward into our discussion of roots and

118
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,579
root structure so so thanks for making

119
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,280
the time to come back right away

120
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,599
I'm so excited so let's let's dive right

121
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,579
into it and we're going to start out

122
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,960
with some Basics because it's become

123
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,060
pretty obvious

124
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,879
um over the years I've taken questions

125
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,379
from audience members and and you know

126
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,659
the people who I talk with at

127
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,579
conventions that there's a lot of us in

128
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,220
cannabis cultivation that kind of take

129
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:49,379
roots for granted and so we're going to

130
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,780
start with some basics of what Our Roots

131
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,659
and and how they form so so let's start

132
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:57,899
with the ultra basic what are Roots made

133
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,820
of and how are they formed by the plant

134
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,560
oh goodness

135
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,540
um so roots

136
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,399
optically an old chicken of the plant

137
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,680
that are made up of a couple of

138
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,719
different types of tissue there's a

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,400
vascular tissue to help transport water

140
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,259
up into the nutrients up into the rest

141
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,418
of the plant it's surrounded by some

142
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,819
other tissues that can kind of respond

143
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:19,319
to the environment there's an epidermis

144
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,300
layer that kind of acts like a skin

145
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,439
around the whole thing to prevent like

146
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,800
microbes and things like that from

147
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:28,918
getting in and the purpose of a root is

148
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,780
basically to provide anchorage so that

149
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:32,639
the plant stays put and can survive wind

150
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,339
and all that kind of stuff but it's also

151
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,800
for um for getting nutrients into the

152
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,060
plant

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,600
my understanding is that there are

154
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,220
different types of roots um I you know

155
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,680
there's there's like the primary Roots

156
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,660
the big chunky parts that we can see but

157
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,639
then they they seem to have like smaller

158
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,919
and smaller branching Roots all the way

159
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,439
down to the roots root hairs how many

160
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,379
different flavors of roots are there oh

161
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,478
so many so many flavors it also depends

162
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,219
on the type of species so very broadly

163
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,339
the type of root system that you can

164
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,199
have depends on what species you are and

165
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,119
like for I think for most angiosperms so

166
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,038
those are the flowering plants um they

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,319
get split up into like roots that can

168
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,478
form from a Tap Root and then roots that

169
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,978
are fibrous and a Tap Root basically

170
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,959
just means that the plant will make one

171
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:21,180
big long root that goes down in lots of

172
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,560
lots of roots will come off of that a

173
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,478
fibrous root system is kind of like it's

174
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
closer to the stem and it's it's they're

175
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,079
not as long they're kind of just lots

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,880
and lots but there's also many other

177
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,918
plants that don't even have a true root

178
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,839
system that have like kind of root like

179
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,758
structures and then when we get into

180
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,099
just like a regular root ball that we're

181
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,199
familiar with so like a house plant root

182
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,460
ball for example there's the primary

183
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,978
root but

184
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:46,138
these can get split up into other like

185
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:48,240
branching lateral roots that kind of

186
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,819
move away from the root into other parts

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,780
of the soil and then from there you can

188
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,460
have

189
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,739
um I guess root tears would be the next

190
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:59,038
option it's just like a single celled

191
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,960
little root hair that sits at just a

192
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,879
very short amount of distance from the

193
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,978
root itself and that helps kind of pull

194
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,079
up some more nutrients in the area

195
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:09,300
so let's talk about that Taproot for a

196
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,099
moment um since we are talking about the

197
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,020
roots specifically for our favorite

198
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,699
cannabis plant

199
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,439
um you know it's it comes up all the

200
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,840
time people will say this just kind of

201
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,620
off the cuff they will say

202
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:25,918
um you know they prefer to grow from

203
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,699
seed because they want to grow a plant

204
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:32,219
with a Tap Root because when we clone

205
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,460
cannabis plants the Clones when we plant

206
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,880
them don't have tap Roots

207
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:43,198
um uh is there a particular reason why

208
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,959
clones don't have tap roots and what is

209
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,800
the function of the Taproot in a seed

210
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,180
plant that we are missing out on when we

211
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,879
grow a clone

212
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,918
oh that's a really interesting question

213
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,918
so I guess when we talk about the types

214
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,439
of root systems that a plant can have

215
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:04,019
referring to like a developmental thing

216
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,839
so the plant when it's in a seed is

217
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:09,299
programmed to have a Taproot root system

218
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,519
when we clone we're actually taking

219
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,098
advantage of almost a wound healing

220
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,839
response instead so the plant has the

221
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:18,478
ability to make cells that wouldn't

222
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,799
normally be Roots turn into roots to

223
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,300
help it survive but that isn't

224
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,819
necessarily how it was developmentally

225
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,280
designed to do so when we go to the

226
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,460
Taproot when you grow from a seed that

227
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,559
Taproot goes as far down as possible to

228
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,939
get as deep as possible into the Earth

229
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,979
and

230
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,959
the advantage to like having a very long

231
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,419
Taproot is that if you can go like

232
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,059
meters and meters down into the soil and

233
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:44,699
then produce lateral roots from there

234
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:48,000
then you can access so much more of the

235
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,620
of the ground to get your nutrients from

236
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
and if you have like a really short Tap

237
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,679
Root then you're probably like if you

238
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,500
can only go four inches down you're only

239
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,259
able to access that much of the soil and

240
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,179
so when you grow from a clone I don't

241
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,879
think it truly matters in the long run

242
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:05,699
because we're usually growing in pots

243
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,139
and pots like even if you have a tap

244
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,339
root system you can only get to the

245
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,980
bottom of the pot and then you're going

246
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,540
to be branching out from there but from

247
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,879
a clones perspective like you wouldn't

248
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:16,559
have if you were growing out in like I

249
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,778
don't know a field you wouldn't have

250
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,579
access to that same depth of nutrients

251
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:22,860
it would be harder for you to get to

252
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,200
that makes sense I'm going to push on

253
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,539
this one more time one more question

254
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,259
um I I love the perspective that you

255
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:34,379
shared about how a clone rooting itself

256
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,899
is kind of like a recovery or a first

257
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:40,379
aid event because it's been damaged and

258
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,458
it's repurposing other dare I say stem

259
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,620
cells

260
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:46,559
um but no no different different cells

261
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,060
in the plant to create this this root

262
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,299
environment

263
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:53,879
um does the plant get stabilized and

264
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,759
kind of shake off that

265
00:09:53,879 --> 00:10:00,179
um

266
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,559
that that damaged First Age first aid

267
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:04,079
kind of

268
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:08,278
um living bias and like become a

269
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,080
thriving plant or will a clone forever

270
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,799
um be hobbled by the fact that it wasn't

271
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,800
from seed

272
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,659
plants can River

273
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,399
uh well and if you think about it they

274
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,199
have to they don't have feet like we do

275
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,879
they can't just like Wander over so a

276
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,379
lot of their like responses they're

277
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,679
constantly adapting to a new environment

278
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:33,059
and if it was wildly damaged later one

279
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,379
damage event like say they got flooded

280
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:37,319
or something and then they can't recover

281
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:39,000
they wouldn't survive very well so like

282
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,160
any wound or anything like that you can

283
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,899
do usually as long as you treat it

284
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,458
properly and it comes back to a healthy

285
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,740
environment you should be totally able

286
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,939
to recover which is often why many many

287
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,680
different types of plants are

288
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,560
vegetatively propagated including like

289
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:55,259
potatoes and all sorts of other plants

290
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,899
um but the idea of a stem cell plants do

291
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:00,720
actually have the ability for so many of

292
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,639
their cells to become stem cells unlike

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,680
us where we just have this little tiny

294
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,778
amount of stem cells when we're born and

295
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,419
there's a couple of pockets of it of

296
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:12,480
stem cells in our body that can react in

297
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:15,479
certain ways plants almost any cell can

298
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,740
become a stem cell that will then be

299
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,420
able to be any other part of the plant

300
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,000
that's why tissue culture works so

301
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:23,039
brilliantly right on I'm glad that I

302
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,360
stumbled into that Brilliance I didn't I

303
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,159
didn't realize that was the case I was

304
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,379
trying to make a pun so good thank you

305
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,259
no it's perfect this is a stem cell but

306
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,980
it's also a stem cell right on right on

307
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,039
oh

308
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,159
um so let's talk a little bit about

309
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,500
um the the roots job of bringing in uh

310
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,120
nutrients so one of the things that we

311
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,940
talked about in the exit 8 show that I

312
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,759
found so interesting is all of the

313
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,640
different ways that Roots

314
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,399
um mechanize bringing in nutrition in

315
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,799
different ways and you know on shaping

316
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,299
fire we tend to focus on living Soil

317
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,099
Solutions but we'll definitely be

318
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,719
covering you know all other types of

319
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,339
substrate today especially since we're

320
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,220
talking about Roots but for this

321
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:07,880
question what are the forms of various

322
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,560
nutrients that Roots can't absorb

323
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,539
assuming that they are threatened in

324
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,219
thriving living soil environment because

325
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:16,439
I'm assuming that they're gonna they're

326
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,778
gonna absorb like you know uh like

327
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,120
minerals in one certain way and maybe

328
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,200
fungus in a different way and you get

329
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,940
well I think you understand what I'm

330
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,320
asking

331
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,240
okay so if I understand

332
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,600
asking correctly

333
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,700
um how do Roots take on different types

334
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,339
of nutrients in the soil is that right

335
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,980
so there there's a bunch of different

336
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,680
things when we're talking about I guess

337
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,379
all nutrients at the end of the day can

338
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,659
be broken down into nitrogen or

339
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:46,799
phosphorus ions or like like basically a

340
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,778
salt

341
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,659
happens either because the plant is able

342
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:53,399
to provide some sort of chemical or

343
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,620
enzymatic process that can break

344
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,720
something down right next to it or

345
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,100
because some bacteria or fungus next to

346
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,079
it was able to do the same thing and

347
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,659
they could take it up that way there is

348
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:05,759
some evidence that plants can take up

349
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,139
nutrients as slightly larger molecules

350
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,939
but I think this is very species

351
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,899
dependent I don't think all plants can

352
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,220
do this

353
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,639
um or at least I'm not familiar with

354
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,980
enough papers that have shown this to be

355
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,039
kind of a universal thing and then when

356
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,560
it comes to like bacteria or mycorrhizae

357
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:25,439
or those kind of things it's it's more

358
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,199
of a a conversation between the the

359
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,820
organism and the plant and that involves

360
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,560
some chemical signaling and some

361
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,740
invitations are sent and then the plant

362
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:36,419
is able to repurpose the structure of

363
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,680
the root to house it so it's not

364
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,179
necessarily that it's actually getting

365
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,399
into the cell

366
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,578
more like it's getting a special place

367
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:48,059
in the root to grow

368
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:50,159
um your answer uh is is seems to suggest

369
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,439
that you know another good reason that

370
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,778
if we're going to be growing in soil it

371
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,300
really behooves us to try to make a

372
00:13:54,778 --> 00:14:00,659
thriving and varied

373
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:03,359
um you know Living Root Zone because if

374
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,819
the roots themselves are not necessarily

375
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,278
breaking these different uh nutritions

376
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,160
down and it's their partnership with

377
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,740
bacteria and other types of microbes all

378
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:16,620
those friends need to be there and and

379
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,659
the ways that you know all the ways that

380
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,578
we try to create a thriving root Zone

381
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:23,100
and not and not drown them with our

382
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:24,539
water is all important if the if the

383
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,399
root zone is going to be able to have

384
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:27,778
the buffet that we want them to have in

385
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,059
their living soil

386
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:32,600
I would agree yeah for sure and the more

387
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:35,759
vibrant that Community is the better

388
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,500
nutrition is available and not only that

389
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,360
a lot of the microbes that are found in

390
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,659
the soil provide other benefits aside

391
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,519
from nutrition like competition against

392
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,620
um pathogens for example if you have a

393
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,539
lot of healthy bacteria down there then

394
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,820
there's less room for uh an unhealthy

395
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:52,500
bacteria to show up it might just be

396
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,660
stimulating the plant to make little

397
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,059
immune compounds because they're there

398
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:58,379
and they don't react strongly to that

399
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,819
particular fungus but they're aware

400
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,919
fungus is there and they might be more

401
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,480
ready there's so many things that they

402
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,979
provide

403
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,199
um I know that you do a lot of

404
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,360
aeroponics and so this

405
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,338
um this may be an unfair question to ask

406
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
you specifically for living soil and I'm

407
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,120
not looking for us to like plug any

408
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,399
manufacturers but you know as somebody

409
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,320
who is constantly looking at ways to

410
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,139
create healthier and more thriving Roots

411
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,680
as you do in your research are there any

412
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:27,778
inoculants or particular teas or

413
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,439
anything that you would recommend for

414
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:33,720
living soil people to help support this

415
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,420
uh thriving rhizosphere

416
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,699
yeah I mean so for my research I'm

417
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,979
generally trying to avoid the

418
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:41,939
um the presence of bacteria as best as

419
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,440
possible because I'm really trying to

420
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,199
just get at the root but I do use

421
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,079
compost teas a lot when um when I'm

422
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:50,578
growing at home and I I usually I don't

423
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,278
know in places where you can get them

424
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:55,259
there's like a nettle horsetail bracken

425
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,820
fern tea that you can use a lot of them

426
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,620
have molasses bases which is really

427
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,839
helpful to get certain types of bacteria

428
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,639
and fungus to get growing there's like

429
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,980
so many good recipes online it'd be hard

430
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,019
to plug just one but if you if you go

431
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,940
and and have a look at some compost tea

432
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:11,278
recipes I think the simplest ones are

433
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,620
the best like a little bit of of soil

434
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,379
that's healthy plus some sugar sources

435
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,419
plus some plants is usually a good start

436
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:20,159
Plus in the one that you mentioned I

437
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:22,620
mean you've got the the the

438
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,600
um the silica from the horse tail and

439
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,278
the the growth hormones from the spring

440
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,800
Nettles I mean that's a pretty potent

441
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:31,198
mix you just uh suggested it is yeah

442
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,539
yeah I guess the other one I would say

443
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,879
too is um it depends on the stage that

444
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:37,860
you're adding it because I I will often

445
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:40,078
when I have very young plants I'll do

446
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,539
like a barley tea so you soak barley for

447
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,698
a little while and um all the different

448
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:46,559
growth factors that allow The Barley to

449
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:47,879
sprout are then present in the liquid so

450
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,679
you can either buzz it up or you can

451
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,539
take the liquid off and and put it on

452
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,578
your own seedlings and it it's thought

453
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:54,778
to help grow and I do it myself right on

454
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:58,319
good clue

455
00:16:54,778 --> 00:17:00,059
so um you when you were back recently uh

456
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,120
back when you were here the first time

457
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:05,578
uh recently on episode 99 that show was

458
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,359
all about exudates

459
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:13,318
um which is a is a process that the

460
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,938
roots bring on uh nutrients now granted

461
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,918
that's an hour and a half episode that

462
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:19,079
we talked about exudates and I'm gonna

463
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,780
ask you to summarize it just in you know

464
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,220
in in a short answer and because I think

465
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:25,740
it's important that folks understand

466
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,539
that Roots do have this exudate

467
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,120
relationship because it's pretty badass

468
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:32,279
but I'll I'll you know my goal is maybe

469
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,659
hopefully to tease people with this so

470
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,399
that they understand kind of what you're

471
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,720
talking about for this episode but then

472
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,600
to encourage them to go back and listen

473
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,558
to episode 99 so will you just briefly

474
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,599
uh explain how um cannabis Roots uh work

475
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:50,160
with the exudate relationship

476
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:53,879
yeah so broadly speaking exudates our

477
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,779
um molecules that the plant root will

478
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,520
make that goes outside of the root and

479
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,460
it it's so it's made inside the root

480
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:05,160
it's it's exported outside the root and

481
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,380
while it while it's out there it can do

482
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,900
lots of different jobs it can provide

483
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,080
food for microbial communities it can

484
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,038
help to loosen up some nutrients like we

485
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,619
were just talking about breakdown

486
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:19,200
nutrients and things like that nearby it

487
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,819
can provide some protective efforts too

488
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,740
to prevent I don't know like they could

489
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:24,240
be antimicrobial or antifungicidal or

490
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,759
something like that

491
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,460
um and it they're they're just a huge

492
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,900
broad range of of molecules that do this

493
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,740
job

494
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,919
excellent so so uh go back and listen to

495
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,660
episode 99 for more so um so I'm really

496
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,038
curious we we've already talked about

497
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,558
how the um the roots uh take on

498
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,960
um uh nutrition and

499
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:52,079
um and I believe that mostly happens at

500
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,919
the root hair level would you explain to

501
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,259
us

502
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,360
um in in you know kind of both that

503
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,819
chemical and a mechanical way what's

504
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:03,298
actually happening there at the root

505
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:06,119
hair that allows the nutrition to come

506
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:09,359
on board inside of the root

507
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:11,699
sure I mean I think for the root hair

508
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,500
it still kind of comes across the way

509
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,000
that it would come across in a lot of

510
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,440
other

511
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,079
um cells so when we're talking about

512
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,900
transport from inside or sorry from

513
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,178
outside the in the soil environment into

514
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,740
the root all cells are wrapped up in

515
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,179
this nice little membrane that has

516
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,759
essentially you can think of them as

517
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,340
like little trap doors um for nutrients

518
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,619
to come into the root that are regulated

519
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:37,379
so you'd have to turn on a switch for

520
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,939
them to come in and that happens all all

521
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,740
cells are doing this all the time and

522
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,440
that is no different in a root hair cell

523
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,240
the big advantage to root hairs is its

524
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,660
increasing absorption so if you think of

525
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,640
like think of how big a root is and how

526
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,140
visible it is you could see it it's

527
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,400
usually depending on how long the

528
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,440
plant's been growing it can be super

529
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,240
thick

530
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,058
whereas these root hairs are super super

531
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,859
tiny and so while the main root can plow

532
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:04,079
through the soil at a pretty good clip

533
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:06,599
the little root hairs are meant to kind

534
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,759
of slide in between soil particles and

535
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,558
increase the surface area does that make

536
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:12,660
sense yeah it does

537
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,119
so that's kind of their primary purpose

538
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,820
is to is to increase the absorption rate

539
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,979
and when plants are trying to choose

540
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,259
what kind of doors they want on their

541
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,419
cells the root hairs will often have a

542
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:26,460
lot of like for my work I'm interested

543
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:28,980
in how Iron gets in and those root hairs

544
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,900
can have more iron doors on them so that

545
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,000
more iron can get in on those repairs

546
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,860
than they might in a regular size I like

547
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,900
that trapdoor analogy and so there's all

548
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,240
these different flavors and they only

549
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,419
open when they are looking for the

550
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,620
particular nutrient that approaches it

551
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:46,320
exactly like there's a like a secret

552
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,298
knock or something there is yeah yeah a

553
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,939
little handshake

554
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:52,500
so you know cannabis cultivators often

555
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,720
come into contact with the roots right

556
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,419
like sometimes just briefly when

557
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,120
transplanting but other times if the

558
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,620
plant is root Bound in a container

559
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,139
um you know we might be really

560
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:06,599
aggressive with the roots like grabbing

561
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,240
them and ripping them and thinking that

562
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,639
we're getting rid of tired roots that

563
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,400
were compacted and and most people say

564
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,980
oh I'm stimulating New Growth by pulling

565
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,500
these uh these uh you know roots that

566
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,259
were compacted off and giving it more

567
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,839
room to breathe how careful should we be

568
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:26,519
when handling the roots because on one

569
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,038
hand you know because I learned it from

570
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,259
my mentor the the ripping apart of the

571
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,720
roots like makes sense because that's

572
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:36,419
what I was taught but I also constantly

573
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,538
hear from soil biologists that that the

574
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:41,940
roots are very sensitive and we can put

575
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:43,859
the plant into shock so I'm assuming

576
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,720
that the the truth of the matter is

577
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,119
somewhere in that range

578
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,100
I would agree actually so

579
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,678
I don't think it's wrong to think that

580
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:54,298
you are stimulating growth because just

581
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,280
like we were talking about earlier with

582
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:57,538
the Clone and and how that's a wound

583
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,519
healing response that it makes more

584
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:00,779
Roots When you damage the roots that is

585
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,700
definitely something a plant will

586
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:05,038
respond to and it will make more so it's

587
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,140
more about like hoping you don't damage

588
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,019
it so much that the plant is overwhelmed

589
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,280
I think like roots are very sensitive so

590
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:12,658
as soon as you take them out of the pot

591
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,519
they're being exposed to light they

592
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,140
weren't expecting or touching them a lot

593
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:19,079
of those finer structures like the root

594
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,059
hairs that are so so small and fragile

595
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:22,798
like they're only a single cell thick so

596
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:24,480
like you're definitely destroying those

597
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,460
and it will definitely take the plant

598
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,240
some time to recover from that I think

599
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,159
it it depends on the type of plant that

600
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,099
you're working with well specifically

601
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,200
cannabis yeah but there's gonna be a

602
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,599
certain amount of cannabis plants that

603
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,220
are very sturdy but there might also be

604
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,038
more sensitive plants that maybe don't

605
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,960
grow as well you mean specific like what

606
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,119
we call strains or varieties not

607
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,400
different species entirely

608
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,259
yeah I mean I like I I grow a lot of

609
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,759
plants so I would say species too but if

610
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:55,319
we're talking strictly about cannabis

611
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,400
different cultivars are definitely going

612
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,700
to have

613
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,620
um different figure and so in a plant

614
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,220
that has a lot of vigor you're probably

615
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:06,719
okay to maybe manhandle the the pot a

616
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,519
little bit more

617
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,900
um but in a plant that's very sensitive

618
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,940
and doesn't grow that well it's going to

619
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,820
be trickier and I think most of the time

620
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:18,600
I would I would say that unless the

621
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:20,839
roots are dead or diseased I would try

622
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:23,579
and keep them intact as much as possible

623
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:26,038
you can break them up a little bit like

624
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:27,899
um like when you encounter particularly

625
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,819
with hard-boiled pots sometimes you see

626
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,159
the roots kind of run around in a big

627
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,079
circle yeah and so you can kind of try

628
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,760
and loosen them up so that they'll not

629
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,678
break them but like try and kind of

630
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,058
untangle them a little bit so they might

631
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,720
go somewhere else fluff them a little

632
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:42,119
bit

633
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,679
yeah exactly so that would be okay I

634
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,239
mean I I try and be as gentle as

635
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,159
possible with my root balls but yeah

636
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,200
it's gonna happen regardless I think

637
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,220
just the extent that it happens you

638
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,259
might have to be careful with some

639
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,240
cultivars over others would it be fair

640
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:55,859
to say that if we're growing from seed

641
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,419
and we have a Tap Root we definitely

642
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:59,099
shouldn't mess with that just you know

643
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:01,559
if we're gonna if we're gonna trim Roots

644
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:03,658
trim you know secondary Roots don't be

645
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,720
touching the Taproot

646
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:09,240
yeah I think that's probably fair I I

647
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,339
don't know enough about what happens if

648
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,919
the Taproot gets super damaged whether

649
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,839
it would produce a new Taproot and like

650
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,700
how that developmentally would occur but

651
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,079
I think it like because it does serve

652
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,538
this different function than the other

653
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,460
roots that if you damage it too much it

654
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:24,900
it will cause changes and I don't know

655
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,819
whether those changes would be good or

656
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,059
bad and I think it would be fair to

657
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:32,279
Intuit that um you know a damage to a

658
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:34,678
Taproot would put

659
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,240
um you know extra undue stress on the

660
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,240
plant that it would have to bounce back

661
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,819
from and since we're all dealing with a

662
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,679
timed growing cycle that uh none of us

663
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:46,379
want none of us want to cause that

664
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,059
slowdown in growth so for for our for

665
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,780
our plant um we should probably just

666
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:50,779
stay away from it

667
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,000
time thing if you have like a mother

668
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:59,158
plant that's meant to be in vegetative

669
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,779
growth for a very long time

670
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,159
and it'll never get flipped over into

671
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,200
flour

672
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,000
um you might have different choices to

673
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,620
make so for example it gets root bound

674
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,119
because it's growing so long and maybe

675
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,500
you don't have a bigger pot so you kind

676
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,418
of have to do some pruning above and

677
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,619
then some pruning below and like those

678
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,440
are choices you would have to make with

679
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:18,058
a with a mother plant and how much or

680
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,279
how little you do of it would probably

681
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:22,259
again depend on the cultivar when we're

682
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:23,819
dealing with like a plant that's about

683
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:26,099
to go into flower and it's only got a

684
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,480
certain amount of time that's where you

685
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,859
really don't want to damage the roots

686
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,960
too much because they don't have enough

687
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:32,819
time and all the time that it's going to

688
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,140
spend recovering is time that's not

689
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:36,538
necessarily going to be put towards

690
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,880
yield so in like a in a yield situation

691
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:41,220
absolutely you definitely don't want to

692
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,080
be you know making that plant suffer too

693
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,919
much awesome that's a great delineation

694
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:49,139
thank you so what biology determines if

695
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,460
the roots well you know how like when

696
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,440
you go to transplant when you when you

697
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,380
pull it out of the pot sometimes it's

698
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,140
got those like bright white like pearly

699
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,299
white teeth beautiful

700
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,220
um roots and then and and then sometimes

701
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,019
it'll be like you know somewhere between

702
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,940
a little more beige or gray and then

703
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:07,980
you've got roots that are just like you

704
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:13,380
know sad

705
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:16,380
um is is it just our guesstimate that

706
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,500
um that the white roots are the most

707
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,600
thriving is that the ideal or are lots

708
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,460
of different roots of different colors

709
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,558
perhaps just different kinds of roots

710
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,840
because when I see the bright white

711
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:30,599
Roots I'm all like hell yeah I'm doing

712
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:33,079
good and and when I see the beige ones

713
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,699
I'm like oh I'm not I'm not you know

714
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,619
treating this pot right in some way but

715
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,759
like I I really don't know I just made

716
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:40,918
that up

717
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:44,220
oh what an interesting question

718
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:47,340
okay so the roots like all of the root

719
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,140
is important I I totally agree I love

720
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,699
seeing those little white root tips and

721
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,299
in aeroponics sometimes they're a little

722
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,100
fuzzy because those little little hairs

723
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:58,619
they are adorable and they only occur

724
00:26:56,099 --> 00:27:00,058
usually pretty close to the root tip um

725
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,500
because then they die off and then the

726
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:02,759
plant has other like that's where you

727
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,380
might see a lateral root form or

728
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,359
something passed there

729
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,000
um so the white tips are the actively

730
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,558
growing parts of the root which I think

731
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,819
is why we love them so much and we're

732
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,980
like Yay we've got a lot of white

733
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:15,778
growing areas but the rest of the roots

734
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,140
still super important and the Browning

735
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:21,599
isn't necessarily because of

736
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,600
um bad things so oftentimes what will

737
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,579
happen is different chemistry happens at

738
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:28,859
the tip of the root compared to the the

739
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:31,439
older root plants might put down for

740
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:33,719
example more tannins or protective

741
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,460
molecules that that will change the

742
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,019
color of the root but that's because the

743
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,298
function of the older root is different

744
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,460
if that kind of makes some sense too it

745
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:44,460
does yeah so when we see those kind of

746
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,919
Browner Roots at the at the you know

747
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,259
closer to the stem that's just because

748
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,640
the function has started shifting and so

749
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,900
the chemistry of the root has started

750
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,460
shifting

751
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,440
um and like it would be hard to pinpoint

752
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,538
exactly what is happening there for a

753
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,519
given cultivar but that's generally

754
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:02,879
what's happening the ones where it's

755
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,940
scary is when there is a

756
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,159
black root tip I guess like if that

757
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,900
black black or dark brown or or those

758
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,880
kind of colors are happening at the very

759
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,200
tip of the root particularly in cannabis

760
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,179
because its root tips are white I do

761
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,278
work with some plants that have a whole

762
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,679
bunch of different colors in there but

763
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,240
in cannabis specifically the white tip

764
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,100
um if that's starting to Brown or

765
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,259
anything like that you might have a

766
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:26,519
bacterial problem so yeah it just

767
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,460
depends on where it's happening I guess

768
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,460
so so let's say not quite as

769
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,380
um bad as that black tipped pathogen

770
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,819
version which sounds like a horror movie

771
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,620
to me

772
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:41,339
um uh is there is there any way for us

773
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:43,979
to identify Roots during transplanting

774
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:46,678
that we should shave off because you

775
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,599
know historically I would shave off a

776
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,880
bunch of those beige ones if I saw them

777
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:53,879
and now I know that I that was probably

778
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,278
not well thought because uh perhaps the

779
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,140
the plant is creating tannins in those

780
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,119
regions for

781
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,278
um you know Safety and Security reasons

782
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:05,278
and I just like cut them off is is there

783
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:07,980
any way for for us to recognize roots

784
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,839
that are are a damaged part of the

785
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,079
system that should be shaved off

786
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:15,298
I think you can kind of think about it

787
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:16,859
I guess the other part is

788
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:19,200
um there's a connection between the

789
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:20,879
roots and the shoots where like there's

790
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,120
usually certain routes that service

791
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,480
particular parts of the plant above so

792
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:29,879
it's really hard for us like looking in

793
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,220
the pot as we're trying to transplant to

794
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,559
be able to determine like oh this Branch

795
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,600
I cut off here are these roots here so

796
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:37,918
these ones can go so I think it is a bit

797
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,240
of guesswork

798
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,980
um but like if they're if they're like

799
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,359
particularly dry looking like they're

800
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,700
kind of shriveled

801
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,500
um and uh when a when a root is like

802
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,819
full of water they're kind of I don't

803
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,019
know what the best word to describe it

804
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,639
would be but they're almost like plump

805
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:53,278
you know like they they have they have

806
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,799
like kind of a juicy look and um if

807
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,599
they're on healthy or dead oftentimes

808
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:59,519
they'll be quite thin like a thread

809
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,959
almost and so maybe like the thready

810
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,639
ones you can get rid of a little bit

811
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,278
more easily but it is a lot of its

812
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,259
guests work and I don't have a firm

813
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,679
answer for you as to which part would be

814
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:12,359
I usually for myself I I look for as a

815
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,340
as we were just talking about kind of

816
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,979
like the Browner root tips that might be

817
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:18,839
experiencing some bacterial effects or

818
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,000
something like that but but there can be

819
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,339
good good bacterial effects too so I I

820
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,140
generally just try and do my best guess

821
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:27,119
right on I always had a better answer

822
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,980
well no that that is pretty good because

823
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,199
what I took from it is that if you see

824
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,720
roots that are particularly emaciated

825
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,538
and they visually look thin and like

826
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,819
they're not carrying water that

827
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:41,398
um perhaps those can be removed but

828
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:43,740
generally speaking we want everything in

829
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,678
the root Zone if we don't see like a

830
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,440
black or colorful tip on it so just uh

831
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,538
give give your roots a light fluff and

832
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,080
then go into the bigger pot and and just

833
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:57,839
don't think you have to Touch The Roots

834
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,099
When You're transplanting don't assume

835
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,699
that that's going to be part of your

836
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:06,178
transplanting process only do it if um

837
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,620
uh if you actually see visual problems I

838
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,000
I think that's a pretty fair statement

839
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:10,259
yeah and that's or at least that's what

840
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,240
I do and I know lots of people have

841
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,700
different philosophies and what the best

842
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,079
solution is but I think for getting your

843
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,819
plants to recover quickly from

844
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,740
transplant like as little damage as

845
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:21,418
possible and as as you say like if they

846
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,159
look emaciated and they're really sad

847
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,380
looking Roots like maybe trim those off

848
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,240
but otherwise a little fluffle do you

849
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,020
right on you know one of the one of the

850
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,819
interesting you said you know

851
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,679
everybody's got their own philosophy and

852
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:33,778
and you know that's true and there are

853
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,940
there are different ways to have

854
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:38,038
different philosophies within actual

855
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,620
science but I think when it comes to

856
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:43,679
cannabis we've all been taught so much

857
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:46,199
like Bro Science by our mentors and then

858
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,960
from friends that

859
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,600
um like if if anybody should be

860
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,558
decreasing the number of justifiable

861
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:58,259
philosophies it's it's our community

862
00:31:54,558 --> 00:32:02,038
because we have so much bad information

863
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:04,140
to root out of our community first and

864
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:07,319
then once all that bad information is

865
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:10,559
gone then people can like find different

866
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,538
parts of of you know that the remaining

867
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,839
area to you know count as their

868
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:16,980
particular technique or philosophy but

869
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,558
um I don't know I kind of I kind of

870
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,960
think that that that we we haven't had

871
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:24,898
access to proper science scientists

872
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,960
analytics and research folks for the

873
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:29,879
last you know 40 years that um that you

874
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,798
know us all trying to kind of bring the

875
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,200
techniques all towards the center which

876
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,599
has actually got a scientific basis is

877
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,659
probably a pretty good set for all of us

878
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:41,459
oh I agree and I think um I think that

879
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,480
there's there's all these little habits

880
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,058
that we do that we don't really question

881
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,319
and those I I like to question myself

882
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:48,658
too

883
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,819
um and as you say there's a lot of myths

884
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:52,140
and legends about exactly what type of

885
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:55,200
thing you should do at what time and

886
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,240
things like that so I I think there's a

887
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,700
lot of tried and true methods that have

888
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,919
worked for people for a long time

889
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,960
um but I do agree that bringing things

890
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,700
around to like a scientific perspective

891
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,200
and not just doing it because someone

892
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,580
told you to do it

893
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,380
um which is kind of ironic can be giving

894
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:13,619
advice about this but you know like

895
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,360
think about it you know yeah so um I've

896
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:17,038
got two more questions before we go to

897
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,379
the break now in this in the third set

898
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,359
we're gonna be talking a lot about you

899
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,220
know the care and feeding of a thriving

900
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,019
root structure so that we can have the

901
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,419
best one available but

902
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:29,399
um but before we go to the set break I

903
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:32,399
want to talk about things that degrade

904
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:35,038
Ruth root growth and uh two two

905
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,579
different categories specifically are

906
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:41,519
there particular

907
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:43,980
amendments inputs or fertilizers that

908
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,140
can degrade root growth that we should

909
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,360
avoid in cannabis plants

910
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,820
oh interesting I think this is a this is

911
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,439
a more of a conversation of a mount or

912
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,819
like what the state is because this can

913
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,620
happen when you're building a soil but

914
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:58,439
it can also happen when you're feeding

915
00:33:55,619 --> 00:34:00,479
fertilizer like if it's too I guess

916
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,700
quote unquote hot is the term that we

917
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,500
end up throwing around a little bit

918
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,259
um that can be a problem and most of the

919
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,000
time I would argue it's because

920
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:11,820
um particularly with fertilizers it's

921
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,039
probably because of pH or something like

922
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,080
that where it's like they're just the

923
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:17,579
poor little root is getting flooded and

924
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,679
I think it also happens more with

925
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:22,259
certain limiting nutrients like nitrogen

926
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,139
where the plant is less less able to

927
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,179
close the trapdoor for example nitrogen

928
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,079
is almost always like all the trapdoors

929
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,059
are open all the time because there's

930
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,159
not enough of it so if you flood your

931
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:34,259
root system with too much nitrogen

932
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,659
it builds up but the way that plants

933
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,820
convert what we feed them to a usable

934
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:40,919
form of nitrogen to them all the

935
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,019
intermediates between fertilizer and

936
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:44,460
usable nitrogen are toxic so they'll

937
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:46,019
start killing the cells off if there's

938
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,699
too much of it

939
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:51,358
um and I think

940
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:53,699
with soil if it's not well mixed it can

941
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,440
actually heat up in not just hot doesn't

942
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,500
like too much nutrients but as in like

943
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,079
temperature hot and obviously if your

944
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,579
root zone is like 60 70 80 degrees

945
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,139
you're going to have a hard time

946
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:07,920
surviving in those kind of conditions

947
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:10,980
too so I'd like your example about if if

948
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:15,180
we have uh too much fertilizer in a

949
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:17,760
particular place that it kind of um jams

950
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:21,480
the trap doors open and and kind of

951
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,400
force feeds the plant to its detriment

952
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,599
um that's the same description that

953
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,000
people

954
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,460
um use when describing you know bottled

955
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,800
salt nutrients about how it Force feeds

956
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:36,240
the plant is that what's happening like

957
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:39,359
at the root level is that the um the the

958
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:42,838
you know the synthetically prepared

959
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:45,239
um fertilizer is essentially breaking

960
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:48,659
down the doors and and going in through

961
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,639
the roots of more nutrition than the

962
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:52,920
root Zone would normally let in

963
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,719
yeah so especially with I think it's

964
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,240
more dangerous with

965
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:00,118
um with like synthetic or bottled

966
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,618
fertilizers because it's so concentrated

967
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,420
um and it's in such an available form

968
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,579
the plant doesn't have to do any work so

969
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,039
it just does flood into the root system

970
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:10,440
and as um as I was just mentioning it

971
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,480
like it's not so much that the nitrogen

972
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,460
itself is toxic it's that in order to be

973
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,219
able to turn it into something usable it

974
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,900
goes through a toxic stage so then the

975
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:20,459
Roots can't it's just too much they

976
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,019
can't do that process quick enough to

977
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,079
avoid all the toxic effects of that

978
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:28,440
process it actually can happen with

979
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,940
really rich composts too it just I think

980
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,099
at least in my personal opinion it's

981
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,900
harder to do because a lot of those

982
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,700
composts still need some breaking down

983
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,160
so it's a little bit slower but if you

984
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:40,379
dump like pure compost at the root zone

985
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,659
of a particularly sensitive plant that

986
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,820
isn't capable of taking it all up it'll

987
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,279
start to do similar things yeah right on

988
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,380
okay and then uh the last one is how

989
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,660
about pesticides because you know sure

990
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,960
we we apply the pest herbicides usually

991
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:57,000
fully or up top but we know that through

992
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,159
you know watering and just a regular

993
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,358
biology of the plants either the

994
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:05,699
pesticides will drip down to the soil or

995
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,900
the plant will take it in and move those

996
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:08,219
chemicals

997
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,260
um you know whether or not they be

998
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:12,719
synthetic or you know organic they're

999
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,880
going to move them around the plant

1000
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,338
um are there any pesticides that we

1001
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,200
would want to avoid because they too

1002
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:21,480
degrade root growth

1003
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,279
I mean I have a personal bias against

1004
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,338
this because I don't generally like to

1005
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,339
use pesticides I think that when you

1006
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:30,838
apply I guess it depends very much on

1007
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:32,279
the type of pesticide you're referring

1008
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:34,799
to because a lot of them have toxic

1009
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,019
effects if they're in too high of a

1010
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,720
quantity and it actually can be both the

1011
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:41,699
naturally sourced ones and also the

1012
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:44,039
synthetically prepared ones like if you

1013
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:45,960
put too much mint oil on your plants and

1014
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,880
turn the lights on like those those poor

1015
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,280
little guys are fried

1016
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,660
um but with the pesticides like on

1017
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,880
they're still able to take some up

1018
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:55,618
through the foliar system but depending

1019
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,420
on what mechanism the pesticide is

1020
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,740
supposed to work by

1021
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,599
um I don't know if it would degrade the

1022
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:03,059
root particularly but it might have the

1023
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:06,000
ability to affect the growth like if

1024
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:08,159
it's acting like a growth regulator or

1025
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,019
um or it's got a heavy metal component

1026
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,519
to it or something like that I'm sure

1027
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:13,559
that it can be taken out by the plant

1028
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,119
and if it doesn't have a way to deal

1029
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:17,820
with it and it's toxic in higher

1030
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,960
quantities that will probably happen in

1031
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,300
the plant just like it would in any

1032
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,099
other system it's interesting we keep on

1033
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,960
coming back to balance you know it's

1034
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:27,599
like it's like hey you've got a lot of

1035
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,720
different options for how to cultivate

1036
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,660
your plant But whichever one you do do

1037
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:36,539
it properly and not so much that you

1038
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:38,578
knock your root system out of balance

1039
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,739
yeah for sure and like I think

1040
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:43,079
particularly with pesticides I don't

1041
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:44,939
know if I would be like I'm not

1042
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,920
personally aware of any pesticide that

1043
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,320
if you watered it in at the amounts that

1044
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,300
you would spray it it would cause a huge

1045
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,559
amount of damage I think if you did that

1046
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,079
you'd probably be killing it above as

1047
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,460
well but it might affect the root

1048
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,220
Community too like if you're adding an

1049
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,139
antimicrobial or an antifungal agent to

1050
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:02,279
the top and then it drips into the roots

1051
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,539
I think you'd be affecting the root

1052
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,460
Community more than you'd be affecting

1053
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:07,320
the plant which of course does affect

1054
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,699
the plant eventually yeah yeah for sure

1055
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,039
I have to be careful with that myself

1056
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:13,739
because one of my favorite

1057
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,480
um uh well I I think of it as a

1058
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:16,439
pesticide but really it's it's more

1059
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,420
about

1060
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,420
um discouraging pests

1061
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,720
um I really like a a garlic fermented

1062
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,000
plant juice on on the uh you know

1063
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:30,000
sprayed foliar during

1064
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,059
uh during veg because

1065
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,559
um you know it no no like aphids is my

1066
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:36,239
big problem where I live they just don't

1067
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,799
want to live there they don't like they

1068
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,719
don't like the experience for what you

1069
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,420
know whatever smell taste reason and so

1070
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:44,399
but but if if I put too much of that

1071
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,039
onto the plant and it soaks down into

1072
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,139
the substrate well garlic also has

1073
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,599
antimicrobial

1074
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:53,598
um uh aspects of it and and I don't want

1075
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,338
that happening in the root Zone

1076
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,200
absolutely yeah I think I think it as

1077
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:59,219
you say it's about a balance so if you

1078
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,899
if you just have to be careful

1079
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:02,759
especially when you're trying to alter

1080
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,619
something that's happening to the plant

1081
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,900
in a way that doesn't affect the plant

1082
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:10,500
too it just gets I don't know it's

1083
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:13,320
sometimes it's subtle yeah well the more

1084
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,760
we get into the cultivation specifics uh

1085
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,900
it is more and more subtle right it's

1086
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,880
like when you first start growing

1087
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,740
cannabis it's like oh you know just put

1088
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,358
the seed in the ground and it grows and

1089
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:23,639
then at the end you got some weed but

1090
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,578
then you like want more yield and better

1091
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,679
weed and healthier plants and you want

1092
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:30,900
to keep more floor plans and that's

1093
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,358
where the subtleties come as as we get

1094
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,119
you know more and more in love with this

1095

really sketchy ride and that's only one

1154
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:48,358

award-winning cannabis seeds that come

1207
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,619
from the analytical breeding program of

1208
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,800
Seth and Eric Crawford who founded

1209
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:55,440
Oregon CBD seeds in fact Seth was a

1210
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,539
guest on shaping fire in 2020 to talk

1211
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,300
about triploid genetics

1212
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:02,940
Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC

1213

1214
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:10,200
the revolution seeds at GTR seeds.com

1215
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,839
their high THC seeds are extraordinary

1216
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:15,179
in that they will start to flower at 16

1217
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:17,159
and a half hours of daylight instead of

1218
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:20,279
the typical 14 and a half hours of

1219
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:22,259
daylight that means in most regions your

1220
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,540
plants will start to flower outdoors in

1221
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:27,119
the middle of July instead of the middle

1222
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:29,279
of August which means these photo period

1223
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,800
plants finish in September and not

shangolos and my guest today is plant

1256
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:58,079
biologist Sarah Lane so during the first

1257
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:00,480
set we looked at what exactly a route is

1258
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,000
and the jobs that it does and some

1259
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,599
things we want to avoid if we want a

1260
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,920
thriving uh you know root Zone here in

1261
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,800
the second set we're going to talk more

1262
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,639
about the actual structure which is what

1263
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,980
what the topic that was the Genesis of

1264
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:19,618
me asking Sarah to come back right away

1265
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:23,159
because during the exit 8 show she got

1266
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:27,059
into this explanation about how

1267
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:31,519
um the root structure is different in a

1268
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:34,039
Coco choir and um Pete

1269
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:37,800
non-soil or soilless

1270
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:40,079
containers than it is in living soil and

1271
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,700
oh I wanted to go down that path um but

1272
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,800
we just didn't have time then and so

1273
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:45,539
here we are today and we're going to go

1274
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,880
down that in a lot of different ways so

1275
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:50,400
so Sarah let's start at the top when we

1276
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:54,420
when we use the phrase root structure

1277
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,760
What specifically do we mean

1278
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,619
I think like when I think of root

1279
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,599
structure I think about

1280
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,400
um the root ball itself the different

1281
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,380
components that make up the root

1282
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,660
structure and how that differs between

1283
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,818
plants whether that be cultivar or

1284
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:10,559
species or whatever and that's usually

1285
00:48:08,818 --> 00:48:12,300
like how the different components might

1286
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,559
be arranged whether they're present or

1287
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,000
absent

1288
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,219
um all of that would be something I

1289
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,559
would call Root structure

1290
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:21,299
so in a typical cannabis plant what

1291
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:24,299
would we expect the root structure to

1292
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:27,000
look like in soil like is there you know

1293
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:29,880
since since in nature it's in soil I'll

1294
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,818
say that the the soil root structure is

1295
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,260
the air quotes more natural one just for

1296
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:36,599
the for the time being just okay let me

1297
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,520
get away with that and uh and so what

1298
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:43,579
what would we expect root structure to

1299
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:43,579
look like in soil in the ground outside

1300
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,279
okay

1301
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:49,679
um well I mean we can stick with our

1302
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,780
beautiful cannabis plant a nice big Tap

1303
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,639
Root goes straight down as far as it

1304
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,540
possibly can grow

1305
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,659
um you can think of that like the

1306
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:59,818
vertical axis I guess and then from that

1307
00:48:57,659 --> 00:49:01,739
all these lateral Roots start to grow

1308
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:03,779
that kind of stick out from the main

1309
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:05,818
root and they go sideways so they're

1310
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,920
they're trying to like increase the

1311
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:09,900
different places that the root can

1312
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,460
access and then from there there might

1313
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,160
be even more little branches and more

1314
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:16,199
little branches and then at the growing

1315
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,818
tip of the root there's a little tiny

1316
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:19,679
Zone there where there's a bunch of

1317
00:49:17,818 --> 00:49:21,559
little root hairs that grow and they

1318
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,879
don't live for a hugely long time

1319
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:27,900
because that root is still moving places

1320
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:30,119
and they so maybe like a couple of weeks

1321
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,440
we can barely see with the naked eye and

1322
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:33,358
we definitely can't see how thin they

1323
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,460
are because they're a single cell wide

1324
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:36,539
um but they they would be just in like a

1325
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,760
little maybe I don't know a couple

1326
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:40,739
centimeters long zone right there and

1327
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,359
they would kind of bush out into the

1328
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:45,358
into the soil

1329
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:46,679
when I see diagrams of root structures

1330
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,779
of different

1331
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:51,659
um types of plants

1332
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,940
um some of them go you know quickly

1333
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,699
really deep and some

1334
00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:00,059
stay at the top and then some will throw

1335
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:01,618
down like a Taproot and then and then

1336
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:05,460
and then the rest will stay at the stop

1337
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:09,300
at the top what is the architecture of

1338
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:12,720
the the root system in an adult plant

1339
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:15,318
are are they mostly up top where they

1340
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:19,559
can support the plant from falling over

1341
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:21,358
and you know get uh rain water or with a

1342
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:24,838
cannabis plant are they all making this

1343
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:27,900
Mad Dash for depth uh in order to create

1344
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:32,000
stability that way and get you know

1345
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,000
water that is in the soil or aquifer

1346
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:36,118
um in in cannabis plants okay so we

1347
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:38,519
talked about this a little bit earlier

1348
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:40,619
like if it's a clone it might not get as

1349
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:42,659
deep if we're talking about like in soil

1350
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:45,660
uh because it doesn't necessarily have

1351
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:47,399
that deep Tap Root to go driving down to

1352
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:50,219
the bottom but in most cases like that

1353
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,960
Tap Root it also anchors the plant as

1354
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:53,279
well because I mean I don't know if

1355
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,159
you've ever tried to get up some of

1356
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,780
these weird little red carrot type weeds

1357
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:00,118
in your garden you have to really Yank

1358
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,980
on them like that tap Roots deep and

1359
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,480
that plant is not falling over for the

1360
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,800
most part so it does provide a lot of

1361
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,740
Anchorage

1362
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,539
um but I think like what we're talking

1363
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:13,318
about diagrams and things like that that

1364
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:15,539
we find like I think most of the time it

1365
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,519
depends on species so for cannabis it's

1366
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,380
it's mostly going to be on a tap root

1367
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,599
system that's going straight down and

1368
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,039
then it's there for water for Anchorage

1369
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,838
for all these different things but then

1370
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,000
all the lateral Roots Provide support

1371
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:29,159
for whatever that purpose is so it's

1372
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,920
kind of digging in there but also

1373
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:33,539
increasing absorption the deeper The Tap

1374
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,760
Root two the more likely it is to

1375
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:37,739
survive things like dry out because it

1376
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,380
can access that groundwater layer

1377
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:41,519
whereas we find in a lot of plants and

1378
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,720
here I'm not talking about cannabis

1379
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,179
specifically but a lot of plants that

1380
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,639
make surface Roots it's actually a very

1381
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:49,259
nutrient Rich layer of the soil where

1382
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:51,900
most of the organic matter sits so a lot

1383
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,579
of the lateral Roots above are meant to

1384
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,780
get nutrients specifically they're not

1385
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,980
particularly good at getting water

1386
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,480
because there's not a lot of water

1387
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,300
usually in that layer

1388
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:04,500
so earlier you mentioned that

1389
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:07,318
um in um in container plants uh clearly

1390
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,760
the Cannabis Tap Root cannot go as

1391
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:11,880
deeply because it's going to be stopped

1392
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,520
by the bottom of the pot

1393
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:18,780
um other than a Tap Root that doesn't go

1394
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:22,380
as deeply as it may like what other root

1395
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:24,420
structure changes might we find in the

1396
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,240
the lateral and other root structures

1397
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:30,300
when they are in a container versus when

1398
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:32,338
they are free-flowing in the ground

1399
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,220
mostly I I think it would have to say

1400
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:37,199
length I haven't really dissected a like

1401
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:40,199
you know removed all the soil to have a

1402
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,639
look but I would guess that because

1403
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:44,338
um and I guess it does depend on the

1404
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:46,739
type of pot too so for example we use uh

1405
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:48,119
cloth sided pots and they're meant to be

1406
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:51,000
sort of like self-pruning so we don't

1407
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:52,619
get like running roots and so for us we

1408
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
would end up probably seeing more and

1409
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:57,000
I'm speculating here but I would expect

1410
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,338
to see more shorter lateral roots that

1411
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,719
are coming off that mean Taproot um and

1412
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:02,159
and they probably wouldn't grow as much

1413
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,199
but there's probably more branching and

1414
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,879
by branching I mean like lateral and

1415
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:07,379
then these little Roots Branch off of

1416
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,640
that and some more Roots Branch off of

1417
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,858
that kind of exactly the way a tree

1418
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,779
looks on top but below

1419
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:15,480
so what happens well you know what are

1420
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,440
the effects of compaction on the root

1421
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,119
structure

1422
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,920
um you know we we talked in the first

1423
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:23,400
set about

1424
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:27,300
um how in a um

1425
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:30,480
uh a pot bound plant how the The Roots

1426
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:33,300
Run along the sides but I would think

1427
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,900
that as a plant is getting more and more

1428
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:39,900
root bound that there are other uh

1429
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:43,818
changes uh that happen in the root Zone

1430
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,818
to deal with that systemically

1431
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:51,058
sometimes there's just not that much

1432
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,280
soil and I mean I would expect the first

1433
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:54,900
thing would be just like the soil

1434
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,880
properties change so you don't have as

1435
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,559
much water retention

1436
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,940
um there's not as many

1437
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,319
um like when we talk about things like

1438
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,760
cation exchange and stuff like that

1439
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:04,500
there might not be as many sites for

1440
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,140
that to happen so that's basically the

1441
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,760
way that soil acts like a little kitchen

1442
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:10,500
cupboard if you will

1443
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,839
um and there would be less kitchen

1444
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,239
cupboards available for nutrients to be

1445
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:17,219
retrieved from and so most of the time

1446
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:19,259
when we have a super root bound plant

1447
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:22,139
it's just there's not enough physical

1448
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,900
space and soil to support that much

1449
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:26,639
plant does that make sense yeah it's not

1450
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,559
so much that the root architecture

1451
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:31,019
itself may be changing although it might

1452
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:35,040
it's more just it just can't support

1453
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:37,619
that much root in that little space

1454
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,679
and so then the systems will start

1455
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:41,880
happening happening and efficiently and

1456
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:43,858
it'll essentially just fall out of

1457
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,358
balance and your plant will get sick in

1458
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:46,980
one of many ways

1459
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,019
yeah and it's usually like I think the

1460
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,460
first thing I notice when when plants

1461
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:52,858
are too root bound is like it's just

1462
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,780
hard to keep them fed and watered you

1463
00:54:52,858 --> 00:54:56,759
have to water more often

1464
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,960
um I've had a couple of plants that have

1465
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,220
actually almost pushed through the

1466
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,440
bottoms because I haven't had a chance

1467
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:04,318
to get to them so the like they just

1468
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,780
kind of push the pot out of the way

1469
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:08,579
um but it it can get pretty bad and then

1470
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,319
you end up with a root ball that just

1471
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:11,579
can't sustain the amount of shoot growth

1472
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:13,500
that you have

1473
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:15,420
um and then and then the plant just ends

1474
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,679
up getting super deficient and if we

1475
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,240
wanted to relate that to something like

1476
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:19,558
yield I think your yield would be

1477
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:21,719
severely impacted because they just

1478
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:23,760
can't put that much nutrients towards

1479
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,739
the rest of the plant it's always a bad

1480
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,900
scene when you find the plant that you

1481
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,219
forgot to transplant and it's got all

1482
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,039
the roots that are coming out of the

1483
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:35,098
holes the drainage holes and you're all

1484
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:37,259
like oh baby I'm so sorry I forgot I

1485
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:38,760
didn't see you over there and and you

1486
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,559
know sometimes you get lucky and it was

1487
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,900
sitting on something else and so now

1488
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,760
it's it's re-rooted itself in like the

1489
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,740
pot under it or something you know yeah

1490
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,720
which is which is always interesting but

1491
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:49,858
yeah that's that's a bad day at the

1492
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:51,239
office when you find that you've

1493
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:52,318
neglected a plant that bad because you

1494
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:54,299
know you're gonna have to cut those

1495
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:56,880
roots and that's not going to be a good

1496
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:58,800
day I've gotten pretty Adept at pulling

1497
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,838
those roots out of holes partly because

1498
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,000
of the way that I deal like my research

1499
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:04,019
plants um I need them to kind of do that

1500
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,239
so

1501
00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:08,579
um there's ways to untangle them very

1502
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,558
carefully but uh but that does just go

1503
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:12,660
to show you how efficient plants are at

1504
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,819
seeking out nutrients like nothing in

1505
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:16,379
this pot out we go we're going somewhere

1506
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:18,300
and we don't know where it is but it

1507
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,858
will find something somewhere to eat

1508
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,559
yeah and you know that's a really good

1509
00:56:19,858 --> 00:56:24,719
point you know for for folks who are

1510
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:28,500
home Growers who are you know growing

1511
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:31,318
two or four or 15 plants where every

1512
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:34,800
plant is important because they need to

1513
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:37,980
yield their medicine for themselves

1514
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:40,800
um you'll have a lot more time to kind

1515
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:44,760
of you know wiggle the plant back and

1516
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:46,680
forth and you know gingerly pull them up

1517
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,800
and try to save as many of those roots

1518
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:51,838
versus you know in a in a scaled

1519
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,300
commercial or you know medical

1520
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:57,000
environment where you've got you know a

1521
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,318
hundred or a thousand plants where you

1522
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,780
know you're just going to pull your your

1523
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,579
knife and go you know cut cut and pull

1524
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,280
it out and Transplant it and you know

1525
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:08,220
that's that's a very different kind of

1526
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,660
of of cultivation but it is interesting

1527
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:12,959
how

1528
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:15,480
um the same problem has to be solved

1529
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,179
different ways depending on the variety

1530
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,740
of cultivation that you're doing

1531
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:22,139
absolutely yeah yeah and I think it's

1532
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:24,000
it's something to mention too like like

1533
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:26,039
if you have the time to try and save the

1534
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,679
roots I think it helps we were talking

1535
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:30,900
earlier about like how much root to lose

1536
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:32,399
and that kind of stuff but the actively

1537
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,079
growing roots are really the ones you

1538
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,519
want to try and save so I do my absolute

1539
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,900
best because those little Runners are

1540
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:39,358
probably the most active as they're

1541
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,400
trying to escape my poor little pot

1542
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:44,159
situation

1543
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,680
so so this next question is the one that

1544
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,960
um that was that was spun off in in

1545
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:51,058
episode 99 and the exudates which is

1546
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,380
kind of the seed for this episode which

1547
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:55,440
is

1548
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,780
um you know Coco and Pete cultivation

1549
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,940
systems have become like really popular

1550
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:03,119
over the years and I and I think still

1551
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:05,460
increasingly so and you know in the in

1552
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:09,480
the beginning folks were using Coco

1553
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:11,818
choir and Pete to supplement what we

1554
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,099
generally think of is living soil as a

1555
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:17,519
as an aeration and water retention

1556
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:19,380
solution but nowadays people are just

1557
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,000
using cocoa and Pete and they're not

1558
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,338
even using

1559
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,679
um you know the living soil aspect and

1560
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:28,380
then they are then they are adding

1561
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,519
nutrition into these cocoa and peat pots

1562
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,559
with

1563
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,659
um you know what whatever whatever kind

1564
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:37,019
of fertilizer they choose from from

1565
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:38,519
compost teas to to amendments to to

1566
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:41,400
bottled stuff so there's there's a lot

1567
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:43,798
of options with these these systems and

1568
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,920
you had mentioned that a root structure

1569
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:49,559
is going to be different in these types

1570
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,720
of pots and and I'm super curious to

1571
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:54,059
hear what the differences are

1572
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:55,858
I guess that I guess when we think of

1573
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:57,480
root structure we kind of have to back

1574
00:58:55,858 --> 00:58:59,219
up and realize that the root structure

1575
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,960
is kind of dictated by the environment

1576
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:02,879
and the needs of the plant

1577
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,920
so like when we talk about whether

1578
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,420
plants make a lot of lateral roots or

1579
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,298
not like they're going to make lateral

1580
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:11,818
Roots but how many depends on things

1581
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:14,338
like nutrient availability or oxygen

1582
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:17,219
presence absence that kind of thing

1583
00:59:14,338 --> 00:59:20,159
so in a soil that's very

1584
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:21,358
mixed up there's like when you mix a

1585
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,039
good soil like you it's going to be

1586
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,239
quote unquote homogeneous to your eyes

1587
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:25,798
you're going to make sure that like the

1588
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:27,298
Pearl lights in there evenly there's not

1589
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:30,059
a big Clump and stuff like that but on a

1590
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:31,798
on like a microscopic level it's not

1591
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:33,599
really there's little pockets and so

1592
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:35,940
that's going to influence the plant

1593
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,280
because it has to move towards Little

1594
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,740
areas of nutrients

1595
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,599
um in a system where the nutrients are

1596
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:44,399
actually homogeneous when we're watering

1597
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:46,920
it in and we're not necessarily

1598
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,559
providing any other source the plant's

1599
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,059
still going to be moving around in there

1600
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,559
but it might it might need to act

1601
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:54,480
differently

1602
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,540
um because it doesn't have that many

1603
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,119
different pockets in the in the soil

1604
00:59:57,539 --> 01:00:01,858
system and I think Hydroponics is the

1605
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:03,539
most extreme of that because we can not

1606
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:04,798
only can we really see the roots to look

1607
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:07,259
at them

1608
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:09,059
um but there there's just one place that

1609
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,339
all of these nutrients are and they're

1610
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:14,040
evenly available so I would expect to

1611
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:15,779
see less branching and less root hairs

1612
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:18,539
and that kind of thing that's

1613
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:19,798
interesting so one of the uh one of the

1614
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:24,480
things we talk about in the show a lot

1615
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:28,019
is how in a in a living soil with a good

1616
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:30,358
fungal environment that the fungus is um

1617
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:33,960
you know creating channels for the water

1618
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:36,779
to seep through and for the the roots to

1619
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:40,079
find their ways through and it would be

1620
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:41,460
my expectation that in cocoa and peat

1621
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,039
systems

1622
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:45,000
um because there is less

1623
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:48,058
um

1624
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,760
tiny particles of soil to fill in in

1625
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:53,880
between that a cocoa and peat system

1626
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:56,520
will have a lot more air pockets oh and

1627
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,260
well I'm not don't want to dwell on the

1628
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:00,659
air part but more like

1629
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:03,960
um paths passages for the roots to

1630
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:07,159
follow do you find that in cocoa and

1631
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:09,480
peat systems the the roots are are

1632
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:12,179
growing more willy-nilly because they

1633
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,519
have so many more options instead of the

1634
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:16,318
fewer options that you would find in a

1635
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:18,960
living soil system

1636
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:21,119
I guess it depends like I think I think

1637
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,920
the more complex the soil system is the

1638
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,660
more complex The Roots become because

1639
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,220
they're just like I said they have to go

1640
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:27,539
adventuring for all of the things that

1641
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:30,719
they need and it's not all immediately

1642
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:33,000
readily available I feel like with

1643
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:35,159
aeration for example or like Pockets

1644
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,380
like there there's probably other things

1645
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:39,838
and whether you'd notice it if you just

1646
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:41,280
like pulled the two root systems up like

1647
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,739
you might notice that if you count up

1648
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,540
the all the lateral roots or if you you

1649
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:47,818
know measure the thickness of the root

1650
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:49,858
it might might change but I think it

1651
01:01:47,818 --> 01:01:51,480
would be a lot of chemistry would change

1652
01:01:49,858 --> 01:01:53,400
too does that make sense yeah does that

1653
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,039
answer your question yeah yeah

1654
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,780
um and then um I'm gonna ask you a

1655
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:01,079
similar question but with two different

1656
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:04,019
uh varieties uh first will be you know a

1657
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:05,519
hydroponic version where there is

1658
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:07,318
um you know there is some kind of

1659
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:10,559
cistern of water and you've got

1660
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:13,739
nutrients there and the roots are

1661
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,380
growing down into it and I guess this

1662
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:21,598
would work for an earth box too where

1663
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:24,358
the the the roots are sitting in the the

1664
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:27,240
nutrient water

1665
01:02:24,358 --> 01:02:29,159
um how will the roots grow differently

1666
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:31,919
in that kind of environment where they

1667
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:34,199
really don't have to travel at all to

1668
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,798
access the nutrition

1669
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:39,779
I think they'd probably grow down more

1670
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:41,940
um the one thing that I I've noticed the

1671
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,599
most at least in my own research

1672
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,059
um

1673
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:48,059
is that the root hairs are missing

1674
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:49,619
because they're so fragile

1675
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:51,000
um and they might like if you took out a

1676
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:52,858
microscope and did a little cross

1677
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,980
section and did some fancy staining you

1678
01:02:52,858 --> 01:02:57,900
might still see like the starts of a

1679
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,818
root hair or the types of cells that

1680
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,980
could form a root hair but when you

1681
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:03,838
actually look at roots that are grown in

1682
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,219
Hydroponics especially because there's a

1683
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:07,619
current and stuff like that it doesn't

1684
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:10,318
really permit those super fragile

1685
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:12,119
structures from showing up at least not

1686
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,858
macroscopically like I can't see them

1687
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:16,740
with my eyes

1688
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:18,058
um whereas like other systems they

1689
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:20,219
probably would be present because

1690
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:22,140
they're not being disturbed as much do

1691
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:24,419
you think that that impacts the thriving

1692
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:25,940
nature of the plant or is it just like

1693
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:28,619
equal and different

1694
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:31,679
I I lean towards equal and different

1695
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:33,900
because the purpose of a root hair is to

1696
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:35,578
increase absorption and that's really

1697
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,559
important when we talk about like that

1698
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:39,000
super complex soil mixture we were just

1699
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:40,380
discussing

1700
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,358
um where you might need the extra

1701
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,579
absorption because that little pocket of

1702
01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:46,440
of minerals is just a little too far

1703
01:03:44,579 --> 01:03:48,599
away for the the chemistry of the main

1704
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,338
root to help and it just needs like a

1705
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:51,180
little finger to go in there and collect

1706
01:03:50,338 --> 01:03:53,940
it

1707
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:55,798
um whereas in a hydroponic system you're

1708
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,599
readily changing the nutrients over

1709
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:00,119
you're readily providing it with what it

1710
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:02,700
needs and it doesn't necessarily like it

1711
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:06,119
a regular root tip might be totally fine

1712
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:07,558
for absorbing what's there I follow so

1713
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:09,960
the last one I want to talk about is

1714
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:11,819
aeroponics and

1715
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,039
um you know there are certainly not very

1716
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:16,019
many of us cultivating cannabis who have

1717
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:18,838
got adult plants that are using

1718
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:21,179
aeroponics however

1719
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:23,578
um it's incredibly common for folks to

1720
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:26,338
use aeroponic uh cloners at the

1721
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:30,119
beginning of a plant's life

1722
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:34,380
um so my question again is when the

1723
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:36,780
plant is hanging but it is suspended and

1724
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:39,180
it's not in it's not you know actually

1725
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:42,780
submerged in the nutrient water it's

1726
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:44,818
actually being sprayed with fine Mist

1727
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:47,240
um how does that impact the root

1728
01:04:44,818 --> 01:04:47,239
structure

1729
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,460
um like for me I use even finer Mist I

1730
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,260
use fog and I notice quite a big

1731
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,838
difference like like the plant just

1732
01:04:55,260 --> 01:05:00,299
doesn't need to go down as much

1733
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,279
um and I don't have empirical evidence

1734
01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:04,559
that it's like particularly long or

1735
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,180
short but for for my plants in

1736
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,519
aeroponics I find they kind of they're

1737
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:10,318
pretty bushy and those root hairs are

1738
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:12,480
retained that's the big thing that I

1739
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:13,858
noticed there because the fog is so

1740
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,139
gentle it's just like a little air

1741
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:18,358
current and you can actually see the the

1742
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:20,159
root hairs come out but they also last

1743
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:22,739
longer because they're not getting moved

1744
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,118
around in the soil or like used up

1745
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:25,798
um and so they do seem to increase

1746
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:28,500
absorption it kind of makes sense when

1747
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:31,139
you're dealing with a very gentle fog or

1748
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:33,659
Mist because it's not it's not as evenly

1749
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,338
distributed as a liquid would be because

1750
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:36,420
it's relying on air currents to for

1751
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:37,920
delivery

1752
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,000
um so I think the root hairs they tend

1753
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,358
to stay longer and they're more

1754
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,159
important in um in aeroponics there I

1755
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:46,199
think if you're spraying like because

1756
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,960
you know like the grocery store high

1757
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:51,000
pressure sure aeroponics that keeps your

1758
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,039
lettuce wet yeah

1759
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,900
um that mist might be enough to change

1760
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,279
the root hairs depending on how fragile

1761
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,559
they are and what you know again

1762
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,240
cultivar species whatever differences

1763
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,740
you want to talk about

1764
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:04,019
um if it's being sprayed directly at the

1765
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:05,699
root you might see less root hairs

1766
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:07,318
um but if it's being sprayed into the

1767
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:08,818
chamber to increase the humidity you

1768
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:10,858
might you might again see more root

1769
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:12,659
hairs something that's a big notice

1770
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:15,480
noticeable difference for me yeah right

1771
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:17,759
on the the the the root structure in fog

1772
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,838
Panic cannabis plants is really

1773
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,940
incredible

1774
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:23,578
um it really looks unlike anything else

1775
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:26,179
and you're right it does look like you

1776
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:29,339
know this this this more compact

1777
01:06:26,179 --> 01:06:31,679
Shrubbery with with all the These Fine

1778
01:06:29,338 --> 01:06:34,318
uh fine hairs

1779
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:37,440
um it does look like its own animal

1780
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:41,338
um do you have any suggestions for folks

1781
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:43,619
who are are starting their clones in an

1782
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:49,500
arrow cloner but their plan is to move

1783
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:55,440
them into a a cocoa Pete or a um a

1784
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:56,940
living soil system because the the root

1785
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,400
system that they have when they're being

1786
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:00,960
moved it's not designed for that

1787
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,818
environment maybe you'll tell me it

1788
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,380
doesn't matter but I want to address

1789
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:07,139
that one way or another

1790
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:08,519
I think it does we uh we kind of

1791
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:09,900
experienced similar issues when you're

1792
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:11,639
transferring from tissue culture too

1793
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,680
because it's a very specific environment

1794
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:16,259
that the root has been growing in it's

1795
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,239
got a certain weight to it it's got a

1796
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:20,400
certain water content all these

1797
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:22,318
different things that can happen at the

1798
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,760
root surface that it can sense it's

1799
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:27,000
going to be very different whether it's

1800
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:29,160
gel or air or water or whatever you are

1801
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:34,019
using compared to the soil

1802
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:36,000
and so my my suggestion would be that

1803
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:37,980
you know most of the times we fill a pot

1804
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,239
and then we dig a little hole and we put

1805
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:42,119
our plant in it

1806
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:44,338
my general suggestion would be don't do

1807
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:45,960
that fill a little bit and then just

1808
01:07:44,338 --> 01:07:47,880
kind of hold the plant up and sort of

1809
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,318
like gently fill it in that way so it

1810
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,119
can kind of retain that structure a bit

1811
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:52,380
more you still have to be careful with

1812
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,059
like large air pockets you're going to

1813
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,260
have to gently press down but I I think

1814
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:56,460
that that would probably preserve the

1815
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,440
structure a little better than just kind

1816
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,818
of smushing it in there don't jam it in

1817
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,280
there let it let it hang of its own

1818
01:07:59,818 --> 01:08:04,019
accord and then fill it around it yeah

1819
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,180
yeah I think that would

1820
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:08,579
best way I think to preserve that very

1821
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:11,038
delicate sort of structure and I don't

1822
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:13,798
have again like this is speculation I

1823
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,780
think it should provide the root some

1824
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,979
support as you're filling it in

1825
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,480
um and I think it would cause less

1826
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:21,059
damage but it's still going to

1827
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,678
experience some differences compared to

1828
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:24,600
what it was growing in so you might

1829
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:26,940
still see some damage

1830
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,980
um just just because it's not as wet or

1831
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:30,539
it's having to adjust the type of

1832
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:32,338
nutrient acquisition it's doing like

1833
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,899
those kind of things but hopefully that

1834
01:08:32,338 --> 01:08:35,039
way the root architecture is preserved

1835
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:37,858
and I know that's something I do with

1836
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:39,359
digiculture is I like I'll fill the pot

1837
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:40,859
three quarters full and then I'll just

1838
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,298
kind of try and like fill in around it

1839
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:44,460
so that the roots kind of supported From

1840
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:47,039
Below before I start squishing it down

1841
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:48,899
all right so um

1842
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:51,600
let's talk about

1843
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:52,979
um uh comparing a couple of these

1844
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,319
different

1845
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:58,259
um uh substrates as far as microbial

1846
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:00,179
life interaction goes so in soil most

1847
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:02,880
cultivators are looking for complex

1848
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:05,940
Micro Systems so that the plant thrives

1849
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,159
and is pests free and has a complex

1850
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:11,159
terpene profile

1851
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:15,059
um and that happens because there is

1852
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:17,579
this burgeoning community of life in the

1853
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:18,600
root Zone in the rhizosphere

1854
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:21,079
um

1855
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:25,079
however in in

1856
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:28,318
cocoa and Pete and in Hydroponics were

1857
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:31,259
were pouring nutrition and in many cases

1858
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:34,679
we're pouring microbes in

1859
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:38,039
uh to the root Zone but uh because there

1860
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:39,838
is not an established soil community

1861
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:42,000
I I kind of get the idea that they're

1862
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:44,100
kind of anything that we add is just

1863
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,979
passing through

1864
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:50,000
um because there isn't a system to

1865
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:54,298
sustain life in those other

1866
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:57,840
non-soil environments so um

1867
01:09:54,298 --> 01:10:01,500
how how does this impact the experience

1868
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:06,420
of the roots to thrive and to bring

1869
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:09,719
nutrition that the added microbes and

1870
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:13,920
nutrition are not I guess I'll say

1871
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:16,260
residents of the substrate but more that

1872
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,899
were were pouring it in and it's there

1873
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:21,000
for a little while and then they're gone

1874
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:24,658
and then the roots are waiting for us as

1875
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,179
the human to add more yes so I guess

1876
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:29,939
I'll answer that in a couple parts first

1877
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:33,359
supplementation of microbes

1878
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:36,119
um it's it's sort of a spicy take but I

1879
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:38,099
don't love the addition of that kind of

1880
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:40,019
stuff because as you say it is very

1881
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,880
transient and most of the times that

1882
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:45,300
we're like when we talk about building a

1883
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:48,840
living soil and we're adding like like

1884
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:50,760
mycorrhizae or um like bacterial I think

1885
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:53,039
bacterial is the easiest to get started

1886
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:54,239
with and because they grow so quickly

1887
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:57,600
and they have such a quick life cycle

1888
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:59,158
people it might do better but most of

1889
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,320
that is relying on the fact that it's

1890
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:04,019
going to stay put in particular

1891
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:05,698
mycorrhizae because like the mycorrhizal

1892
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:08,340
structure that actually provides benefit

1893
01:11:05,698 --> 01:11:10,619
to the plant includes like hyphae which

1894
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,779
are basically little fungal roots that

1895
01:11:10,619 --> 01:11:14,939
that need time to grow they're very

1896
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:16,679
fragile they're even they're even as

1897
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:19,139
thin maybe even thinner than a root hair

1898
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:20,399
like they if you start moving them

1899
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,960
around

1900
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:23,639
um and this is something I don't know if

1901
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,679
you've heard of no-till but it's one of

1902
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,239
the main reasons why people try not to

1903
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:30,480
till their soil because you're actually

1904
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:33,119
disrupting all those little fungal Roots

1905
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:35,218
um and I don't see that that's really

1906
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,738
going to be something that can form

1907
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:40,079
properly in something like Hydroponics

1908
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:41,698
where there's current and in the same

1909
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:43,500
way that the root hairs don't Farm I

1910
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:44,939
would not expect to see fungal hyphae

1911
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,158
form at least not to the extent where

1912
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:48,359
they're helpful

1913
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:50,460
bacteria a little different because

1914
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:52,198
again they can they can still colonize

1915
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,960
kind of on the surface of the plant root

1916
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:57,178
but their main job in a in a soil system

1917
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,198
is to help break down nutrients and some

1918
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,699
of the stuff we were talking earlier

1919
01:11:58,198 --> 01:12:02,759
like provide protection and stuff and

1920
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:06,059
they're just going to be more limited

1921
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,500
um as far as like how that fits into I

1922
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,780
think it's probably easier to get that

1923
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,399
started in Pete but as you say when

1924
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:13,340
we're watering it through and we're not

1925
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:16,799
really providing for the bacterial or

1926
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:18,360
mycorrhizal Community as well they're

1927
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,679
not really getting set up there before

1928
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:21,359
you're adding something different and

1929
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,158
you're just pouring more stuff in there

1930
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:26,639
does that answer your question yeah it

1931
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:30,899
does and um it would make me think then

1932
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:34,079
that um without the the constant access

1933
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:37,500
to the resident microbes and nutrition

1934
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:40,198
as you described it and then instead

1935
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:42,179
um it's just going to be there when I

1936
01:12:40,198 --> 01:12:43,919
add it that

1937
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:46,319
um you know you might so you might still

1938
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,800
get perfectly fine cannabis plants but

1939
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:52,019
there's some percentage of of thriving

1940
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,000
or or in our case with the cannabis

1941
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:57,120
plant specifically

1942
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,399
um yield and uh

1943
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:02,399
and terpene profile that you might

1944
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:05,698
experience a little less in these

1945
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:08,939
mediums where we have to

1946
01:13:05,698 --> 01:13:11,639
um add the nutrition through a cocopeat

1947
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:13,439
or Hydro System whereas in living soils

1948
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,699
it's there

1949
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:16,379
um would you agree with that assessment

1950
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:17,939
that those those plants will be

1951
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:19,859
perfectly fine and people have great

1952
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:22,919
success with them but but there's

1953
01:13:19,859 --> 01:13:26,460
there's some percentage that's more than

1954
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:28,260
zero that would be benefited by the

1955
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:31,198
living soil approach

1956
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,640
I like I am I'm heavily biased towards

1957
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,339
living soil I think it's like such a

1958
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,140
such a fantastic like build an ecosystem

1959
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:38,520
from the ground up and let your plant

1960
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,659
live in it

1961
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,179
um I think we've talked about this

1962
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:45,119
before maybe on the last time I was here

1963
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:47,760
where I certainly believe that there is

1964
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:49,800
a shift like each growing method that

1965
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,960
you use does something a little bit

1966
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,820
different to your plants and it depends

1967
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,439
when we're talking about like

1968
01:13:53,819 --> 01:13:56,880
um like terpene profiles and stuff like

1969
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:59,158
that there definitely is a difference

1970
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,800
when you when you grow in living soil

1971
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:03,119
versus when you grow in Hydroponics when

1972
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,800
you stress them out when you don't like

1973
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:06,479
we we know we can influence these

1974
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,820
terpene profiles depending on what we do

1975
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:10,379
to the plant so I don't know if that

1976
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:12,658
necessarily makes it better or worse but

1977
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:15,000
when we talk about things like bacteria

1978
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:16,259
and adding adding mycorrhizae

1979
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,300
I think you really have to ask yourself

1980
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:20,100
why you're adding it because when we're

1981
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:22,440
going to Hydroponics and aeroponics

1982
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:25,679
we're providing pretty much everything

1983
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:27,419
the plant needs to put on weight as far

1984
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,658
as yield goes like we're providing it

1985
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:32,579
nitrogen and minerals and phosphorus and

1986
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:35,219
you know all these little things to to

1987
01:14:32,579 --> 01:14:37,500
help it out it might not be as good at

1988
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:39,239
defending itself from disease

1989
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,698
um or something like that that might be

1990
01:14:39,238 --> 01:14:44,579
benefited by a living soil but like for

1991
01:14:41,698 --> 01:14:47,399
just making flowers grow it'll be

1992
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:49,019
perfectly fine but that's why when

1993
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:51,960
you're adding it to a hydroponic system

1994
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:53,460
I don't know that it always is doing the

1995
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,679
thing that people think it should be

1996
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:58,739
doing if that makes sense yeah it does

1997
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:01,619
make sense all right so to to wrap up

1998
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:03,419
this second set I'd like to get you to

1999
01:15:01,619 --> 01:15:04,800
weigh in on

2000
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:06,899
um

2001
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,619
um pot variety

2002
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:12,238
um plastic pots versus fabric pots

2003
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:15,539
um you know a lot of people were happy

2004
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:18,059
to move on from the plastic pots

2005
01:15:15,539 --> 01:15:19,439
um because you know a they they get hot

2006
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:22,620
if you live somewhere hot because

2007
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:26,099
they're black uh B you know they don't

2008
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:28,079
breathe if that is an advantage uh see

2009
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:30,000
it can get kind of Swampy in there if

2010
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:33,179
you tend to over water or if you don't

2011
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:37,380
have a good uh soil structure

2012
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:39,480
um versus the the air pots which excuse

2013
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:42,600
me the fabric pots and air pots I guess

2014
01:15:39,479 --> 01:15:45,599
where they they talk all the time about

2015
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:48,239
how uh the roots are air pruned along

2016
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:51,300
the side and um you know there can be

2017
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:53,939
more oxygen exchange but I don't really

2018
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:55,800
know that air pruning along the side of

2019
01:15:53,939 --> 01:15:58,439
a fabric pot

2020
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:01,079
um or more air exchange with the pot are

2021
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:02,639
necessarily good things I I don't I know

2022
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:05,039
they claim them to be good things but I

2023
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,100
don't know that to be true it does seem

2024
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:12,179
that the plastic pots would be more akin

2025
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:13,620
to to actually being grown in soil but I

2026
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:15,060
don't know that so I would like to hear

2027
01:16:13,619 --> 01:16:16,979
you compare the two

2028
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:19,560
okay well

2029
01:16:16,979 --> 01:16:23,279
um I guess for starters I do tend to use

2030
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:24,840
air pots or or fabric pots

2031
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:28,800
um but it's it's sort of a combination

2032
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:31,079
so if we think about the whole oxygen

2033
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,300
air thing we do actually need soil to be

2034
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:36,600
aerated most of the beneficial microbes

2035
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:38,640
that we're talking about today are

2036
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,920
um they're requiring oxygen just like

2037
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:43,679
everything else is and in on the

2038
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,840
opposite hand we have a lot of bacteria

2039
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,899
that are not healthy that grow in

2040
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:52,140
anaerobic or Like Oxygen free areas so

2041
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:55,439
when it comes to extra oxygen I'm I'm

2042
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:56,640
all for that it sort of prevents I mean

2043
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:58,139
there's still other husbandry things

2044
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,300
that you would want to consider but in

2045
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,920
my opinion it helps prevent things like

2046
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:03,420
pythium and stuff like that from really

2047
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,219
taking root

2048
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:07,260
um and like air pruning and stuff like

2049
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:09,480
that it changes the root structure I'm

2050
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,039
not 100 sure if it's for the better or

2051
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:12,718
if the worst but it does seem to do a

2052
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,640
pretty good job of growing like mother

2053
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:18,060
plants and stuff like that I will say

2054
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:19,679
they are paint water because the water

2055
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:21,120
just kind of leaks out the sides you

2056
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,560
still have to have like a plastic saucer

2057
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:24,179
underneath and they don't

2058
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,600
there's definitely things that I don't

2059
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:30,179
absolutely enjoy 100 about them when we

2060
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,260
look at like a hard wall plastic pot

2061
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:32,399
um I think you do like they're

2062
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:34,140
definitely easier to water and they

2063
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,779
definitely retain um they don't dry out

2064
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:38,699
as as quickly I guess

2065
01:17:36,779 --> 01:17:41,039
um so you can put water in there it's

2066
01:17:38,698 --> 01:17:42,479
not evaporating out the sides um so that

2067
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:45,420
the whole root ball it might be easier

2068
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:47,218
to control for water moisture if you

2069
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:48,300
don't water as often or something like

2070
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:50,100
that

2071
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:52,380
um and again I think there's other

2072
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,600
husbandry issues that you that you'd

2073
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:57,840
also have to look into as far as whether

2074
01:17:54,600 --> 01:18:01,320
that necessarily makes the growth of bad

2075
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,239
bacteria easier or not that often has to

2076
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:04,738
do with the type of soil you have too so

2077
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:07,379
I don't know if it's directly relatable

2078
01:18:04,738 --> 01:18:09,000
but I feel more comfortable in in the in

2079
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:11,279
the fabric pots and one way to get

2080
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,920
around the miserable watering situation

2081
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:15,420
is to use like drip emitters or

2082
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,480
something like that where your soil is

2083
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:20,579
more constantly wet which is actually

2084
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:22,319
especially for living soil better

2085
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:25,019
because a lot of the microbes need to be

2086
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:26,880
wet constantly too so as far as living

2087
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:28,620
soil goes my personal preference would

2088
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,100
be fabric pots right on thank you that's

2089
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:34,079
great analysis I use the fabric pots as

2090
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,460
well and there was one thing that I

2091
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:37,319
learned about them that that really

2092
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:39,239
annoyed me I still continue to use them

2093
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:40,619
but I I didn't like this fact figuring

2094
01:18:39,238 --> 01:18:44,099
it out

2095
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:46,439
um I was I was talking with uh uh Josh

2096
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:48,900
from dragonfly Earth medicine about them

2097
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:52,079
and about how how I you know I I like

2098
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:53,579
using fabric pots versus plastic pots so

2099
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:57,238
that there's you know I'm using less

2100
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:59,460
plastic and he had the audacity to point

2101
01:18:57,238 --> 01:19:03,059
out that even though we're using the

2102
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:07,260
term fabric pots that nearly all of them

2103
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:09,239
on the market are spun plastic and I

2104
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:12,000
looked into it and damn it he's right

2105
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:15,000
and so they're they're plastic pots just

2106
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,340
in a different form and so

2107
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,219
um that fact pissed me off and so I went

2108
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:24,300
and I and I I intentionally purchased

2109
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:26,779
actual hemp pots and they degraded and

2110
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:29,520
fell apart in one season

2111
01:19:26,779 --> 01:19:32,279
damn the biology of it

2112
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:34,140
um makes the spun plastic I guess at

2113
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:37,380
least necessary for the time being until

2114
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:40,020
we've got another material but um yeah

2115
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:42,060
me thinking that air quotes fabric pots

2116
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:45,000
were some kind of linen was like totally

2117
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:46,199
wrong no and I think a lot of um I think

2118
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,640
you're probably not alone because I

2119
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:49,500
think a lot of us are trying to use less

2120
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,420
plastic and that kind of stuff and I

2121
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,560
don't necessarily think that fabric pots

2122
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,119
will mean less plastic because it's

2123
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,320
basically like wearing a polyester shirt

2124
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:57,658
or something like that there's

2125
01:19:55,319 --> 01:19:59,819
definitely some plastic in there but as

2126
01:19:57,658 --> 01:20:02,939
you say of any of the natural fibers

2127
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:06,198
tend to disintegrate very quickly

2128
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:09,119
um so like felt or spun or whatever

2129
01:20:06,198 --> 01:20:11,039
you're you're gonna the the more natural

2130
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:12,779
and less plastic you'd go the more often

2131
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,760
you have to replace them which isn't

2132
01:20:12,779 --> 01:20:16,319
really a big deal I guess when you want

2133
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,699
to like transplant into a field or

2134
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:19,500
something you probably like if they

2135
01:20:17,698 --> 01:20:21,599
degrade in a couple of months of you

2136
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:25,800
know watering they're probably okay but

2137
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:29,760
what I hate though is the idea of my uh

2138
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:33,360
spun plastic fabric pots that are

2139
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:35,880
outside and once I learned that as they

2140
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:39,779
degrade over the years they are very

2141
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:41,719
likely shedding microplastics into my

2142
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:44,460
Farm's ecosystem

2143
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:46,739
and that was very disappointing to me

2144
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:48,420
and so I don't have a solution for it

2145
01:20:46,738 --> 01:20:50,759
but I think that I think that it's

2146
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:53,460
important for us all to be aware of of

2147
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,900
the truth of it absolutely and I think

2148
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:56,939
that goes to like like when we're

2149
01:20:54,899 --> 01:20:59,639
choosing things to have a preference

2150
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:01,079
over like I think when you choose a

2151
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,600
fabric pot because you aren't

2152
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:04,979
necessarily saving the plastic

2153
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,000
um and I don't think in the hard wall

2154
01:21:04,979 --> 01:21:07,678
plastic like especially because you're

2155
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,760
putting acidic fertilizer and things

2156
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:10,920
like that through you're breaking that

2157
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,199
plastic down too so I it's it's a

2158
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,960
trade-off more about is it providing you

2159
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:18,119
the great right growing environment for

2160
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:20,279
your method and then make your choice

2161
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:22,380
based on that because fabric pots

2162
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:24,719
certainly in my opinion anyway support

2163
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:26,039
living soil better when you get them

2164
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,619
going

2165
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:30,840
um but I mean a hard wall plastic is

2166
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:32,698
totally fine too right on cool all right

2167
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,860
let's go ahead and take uh our second

2168
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:36,479
short break and be right back you are

2225
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:39,300
one of the challenges with buying

2226
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:41,279
Autoflower seeds is that often you'll

2227
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:43,679
have as many different phenos as you

2228
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:46,500
will have seeds in a pack that can be

2229
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:48,840
fun sure but so many varieties in one

2230
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:50,819
pack is a sign of an immature seed line

2231
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:53,219
that hasn't been worked enough

2232
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:55,139
I prefer my auto flowers to be worked

2233
01:23:53,219 --> 01:23:56,880
enough that each Fino in the pack really

2234
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:58,260
captures the aspects that the breeder

2235
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,140
was intending

2236
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:02,760
this is why I recommend gnome automatics

2237
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:05,100

painstakingly sifted again and again

2242
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:16,140
tested in a wide range of conditions and

2243
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:18,900
taken to a level of maturity that each

2244

2274
01:25:27,658 --> 01:25:32,219
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

2275
01:25:29,819 --> 01:25:34,139
growing is so valued by Farmers is

2276
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:36,179
because the mycelium networks in the

2277
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:38,760
soil remain established from year to

2278
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:40,500
year and we know these fungal networks

2279
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,840
are essential because they are the

2280
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:45,060
nutrient super highways that extend far

2281
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:47,640
and wide in the substrate to feed your

2282
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:50,100
plants the trouble with growing in New

2284
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:54,659
is that it takes most of the plant's

2285
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:57,079
life just to create these mycelium

2286
01:25:54,658 --> 01:25:59,158
highways

2287
01:25:57,079 --> 01:26:01,380
dynomicoendomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

2288
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:03,899
reduces that time and gets your plant

2289
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:06,119
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

2290
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:08,819
and it's three times the concentration

2291
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:11,698
of the other popular brand in the U.S at

2292
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:13,738
900 propagules per gram of two fungal

2293
01:26:11,698 --> 01:26:16,439
species selected specifically for

2294
01:26:13,738 --> 01:26:18,119
cannabis cultivation dynomica is the

2295
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:20,158
result of 30 years of research and

2296
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:22,679
trials at the volcani agriculture

2297
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:24,779
Research Institute in Israel it has also

2298
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:26,960
been vigorously trialed by cannabis and

2299
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:29,698
food Growers across the U.S

2300
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:32,219
dynamico is now available at Grow shops

2301
01:26:29,698 --> 01:26:34,319
and on Amazon in the United States I

2302
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:36,119
love using dynamico to both speed up the

2303
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:38,639
growth of the mycelium networks in the

2304
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:41,219
soil but also as a biostimulant to make

2305
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,960
clone cuttings more viral you can see

shapingfire I am your host shangolos and

2326
01:27:32,698 --> 01:27:37,619
my guest today is plant biologist Sarah

2327
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:39,779
Lane so here we are in set three for the

2328
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:42,719
big finish what we're going to focus on

2329
01:27:39,779 --> 01:27:45,300
this set is is the you know the care and

2330
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:47,340
feeding of a good and thriving root

2331
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:49,380
system because you know it's one thing

2332
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:51,480
for us to understand what a root

2333
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:54,719
structure is and what the what the root

2334
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:56,759
system is doing but we as cultivators we

2335
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,619
want to make it as as healthy and happy

2336
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,020
as we can so

2337
01:27:58,619 --> 01:28:02,158
um so Sarah let's talk about how much to

2338
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:04,620
water

2339
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:07,439
um what should our considerations be

2340
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:10,139
across the various substrate systems we

2341
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:13,079
have discussed today to make sure that

2342
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:15,600
we're we're watering in a zone that is

2343
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:18,059
enough for the root system but not

2344
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,800
enough to drown it well that's a good

2345
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:21,780
question so

2346
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,539
I think the first and foremost things is

2347
01:28:21,779 --> 01:28:26,698
that Roots do not like to dry out so you

2348
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:28,439
want to keep making sure that the soil

2349
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:30,359
is wet and that the roots the root ball

2350
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:32,219
itself is is nice and at least damp

2351
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:33,960
obviously over watering is a problem

2352
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:35,219
because the roots then can't breathe

2353
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,920
they're kind of like drowning if you

2354
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:39,179
will um and and that's a problem so but

2355
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,039
it depends on the substrate of what this

2356
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:43,199
looks like for example in Hydroponics

2357
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:44,819
they're kind of always sitting in water

2358
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:46,559
and there it's more important to make

2359
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:48,960
sure that the the liquid is aerated

2360
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,340
properly so it's not stagnant in

2361
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,658
aeroponics this is almost never a

2362
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:53,699
problem you just want to make sure that

2363
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:55,738
the spray is happening often enough that

2364
01:28:53,698 --> 01:28:57,059
the roots are not drying out while

2365
01:28:55,738 --> 01:28:59,819
they're waiting because it's not usually

2366
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:02,639
a constant thing and then in soils we

2367
01:28:59,819 --> 01:29:04,859
want to usually when I'm watering I lift

2368
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:06,119
my pot up a little bit and as it starts

2369
01:29:04,859 --> 01:29:07,619
to get lighter and lighter you know that

2370
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:10,738
the water is evaporating and then before

2371
01:29:07,619 --> 01:29:13,619
it has a chance to get too dry then you

2372
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:15,658
water again and with living soil systems

2373
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:17,639
it's even more important that it stays

2374
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:20,339
damp so if the surface of the soil

2375
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:22,440
starts to dry out too much it isn't that

2376
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:24,420
healthy for that system so then I would

2377
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:25,919
I would check probably daily or every

2378
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:27,899
couple of days to make sure that the

2379
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:29,219
that top layer is staying at least

2380
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:31,138
damped to the touch

2381
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:34,560
and another read that's another good

2382
01:29:31,139 --> 01:29:37,739
reason to use some kind of uh uh small

2383
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,900
plant cover crop of some sort to uh keep

2384
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:42,000
the top of the pot

2385
01:29:39,899 --> 01:29:45,479
um moist so it doesn't go hydrophobic

2386
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,880
and push the water off and uh and and

2387
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:50,339
helps the water get into the pot I would

2388
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:54,179
think also that cover crops

2389
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:55,980
um would be helpful because the roots of

2390
01:29:54,179 --> 01:29:58,800
the cover crop

2391
01:29:55,979 --> 01:30:01,319
um also interact with the roots of the

2392
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,300
cannabis plant and

2393
01:30:01,319 --> 01:30:06,139
um you know they communicate and share

2394
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:06,139
resources right

2395
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,579
as a soil system

2396
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:13,080
they keep her beneficial

2397
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:15,840
the water in because it's not getting

2398
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:17,158
lost and evaporating as much but also as

2399
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,840
you say because those roots are are

2400
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:21,479
providing like a little layer of of

2401
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,739
support and networking if you are

2402
01:30:21,479 --> 01:30:24,479
careful about what you choose you can

2403
01:30:22,738 --> 01:30:27,138
also be contributing nitrogen for

2404
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:30,119
example we often plant like micro Clover

2405
01:30:27,139 --> 01:30:32,460
or red clover in our pots because it

2406
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:34,859
does kind of give back to the the system

2407
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:37,380
as opposed to some cover crops where it

2408
01:30:34,859 --> 01:30:40,079
would also be using up nutrients I'm

2409
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:42,779
forgetting the the vocabulary word for

2410
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:47,039
it but um there are certain plants that

2411
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:49,380
uh you can uh plant as a companion plant

2412
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:50,579
that actually do does the other plant

2413
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:54,239
harm

2414
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:56,760
um are you aware of any plants where the

2415
01:30:54,238 --> 01:31:01,399
the roots of that plant actually are

2416
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:01,400
combative against cannabis roots

2417
01:31:01,979 --> 01:31:05,218
I'm not 100 sure I know some like

2418
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:08,040
classic I think what you're referring to

2419
01:31:05,219 --> 01:31:09,600
is a lilopathy yes um and there's like

2420
01:31:08,039 --> 01:31:11,939
definitely some plants that are just

2421
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,380
like absolute no toxic but they're like

2422
01:31:11,939 --> 01:31:15,359
big trees like you never plant anything

2423
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:17,039
under black walnut it's like a circle of

2424
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,559
death but you're obviously not planting

2425
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:21,060
that next to a cannabis tree I think if

2426
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,820
you're worried about it sticking

2427
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:25,739
strictly to things like like Clover

2428
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:27,960
um and some of the like if you go to a

2429
01:31:25,738 --> 01:31:30,059
farm supply store they often have good

2430
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:33,060
cover crops there and those plants

2431
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:34,920
usually are compatible with a lot of

2432
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:36,600
other plants I don't know anything off

2433
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:39,359
the top of my head that I would want to

2434
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,039
put in a pot that would do that but yeah

2435
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:42,299
stick with the basics unless you're

2436
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:44,279
choosing to research it first

2437
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:46,860
essentially basically and like there's

2438
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:49,800
lots of lots of Great opera like options

2439
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:52,380
we do Marigold you can do

2440
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:54,420
um like basil you can do like some some

2441
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:56,760
types of herbs are pretty good in there

2442
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:59,039
basil is really good basil and Marigold

2443
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,420
both are good too because

2444
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:01,920
um they can be planted in with your

2445
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:04,139
cannabis plant but they also act as like

2446
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,960
an insect trap because

2447
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:08,579
um like everything loves basil so if you

2448
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,800
plant a basil plant you're probably

2449
01:32:08,579 --> 01:32:12,059
getting the first signs of bugs will

2450
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,980
show up there so they can be kind of

2451
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:15,719
useful that way and of course like the

2452
01:32:13,979 --> 01:32:18,959
Clover is a really good one too I've

2453
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:20,399
gotten into the habit of throwing

2454
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:25,020
um different types of food producing

2455
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:27,000
plants in my pots I I toured a farm

2456
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:29,639
where they were growing potatoes under

2457
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,100
their their plants outside in their in

2458
01:32:29,639 --> 01:32:33,659
in the kind of the duff berm that they

2459
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:35,699
were doing out there at Green Source

2460
01:32:33,658 --> 01:32:37,379
Gardens and I thought that was such a

2461
01:32:35,698 --> 01:32:40,799
great idea but like you know we have to

2462
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:42,960
be in containers where we are so so you

2463
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,060
know I got strawberries grown in one I

2464
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,819
got carrots grown in another like

2465
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:49,260
culinary herbs in another and uh and you

2466
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:51,719
know you get you get that wind from the

2467
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:53,699
cover crop but also you know if you get

2468
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:55,800
hungry out when you're working in the

2469
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:58,738
field you have snacks so a little snack

2470
01:32:55,800 --> 01:33:01,920
that's great right on so um how

2471
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:06,178
impactful is the pH of the water that

2472
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:10,020
we're watering with on the root system

2473
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:13,500
um I think that depends on the soil I I

2474
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:15,060
it's so the pH of water

2475
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,800
that's one of the things that

2476
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:19,260
preferentially kicks off nutrients and

2477
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,719
so the more acidic the water I think the

2478
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:23,159
more nutrients you might kick off what

2479
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:25,980
does kickoff mean

2480
01:33:23,158 --> 01:33:27,238
so I guess if we want to talk about the

2481
01:33:25,979 --> 01:33:29,819
soil as like essentially a kitchen

2482
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:31,559
cupboard all these structures that you

2483
01:33:29,819 --> 01:33:33,238
see with your naked eye on the soil have

2484
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:35,219
all these little charges on them that

2485
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:37,079
that sort of collect all the nutrient

2486
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:39,119
salts that you're adding whether that's

2487
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:41,399
because a bacteria has broken it down or

2488
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:43,679
not as I said earlier everything is

2489
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:46,500
basically assault at the end of the day

2490
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:49,079
um but it stays there until something

2491
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:53,219
would prefer to be in its spot more and

2492
01:33:49,079 --> 01:33:55,738
that's usually acidity so it will it

2493
01:33:53,219 --> 01:33:58,439
will take its place on that soil

2494
01:33:55,738 --> 01:34:01,198
structure and because it takes the place

2495
01:33:58,439 --> 01:34:02,879
then that nutrient is free and it can go

2496
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:03,839
back into the water does that make sense

2497
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,480
it does

2498
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,579
so then that once that ion is or salt is

2499
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:10,919
free then the plant can use it and so

2500
01:34:08,579 --> 01:34:13,380
the plant actually does it itself it

2501
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:15,000
makes acids to go out into the soil and

2502
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:17,579
to kick off all the nutrients off the

2503
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:20,300
soil so that it can take them up and if

2504
01:34:17,579 --> 01:34:23,039
you are watering in a like an acidic

2505
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:24,539
like liquid even if it's just like water

2506
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:25,800
itself or whether you've added like

2507
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:27,420
citric acid or something like that

2508
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:29,039
you're going to be doing the same thing

2509
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:33,119
the plant is doing but you can do that

2510
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:34,738
in excess where it would be too much

2511
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:37,079
um but the soil kind of buffers itself

2512
01:34:34,738 --> 01:34:40,439
too so it's one of those things where on

2513
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:41,939
a on a like a a big level I'm not sure

2514
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:44,219
it's that impactful but that's what's

2515
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:45,479
happening on a small scale

2516
01:34:44,219 --> 01:34:48,119
so

2517
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:50,939
um so as far as like what we can learn

2518
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:54,179
from this it sounds like you know unless

2519
01:34:50,939 --> 01:34:55,799
your water is uh making a significant

2520
01:34:54,179 --> 01:34:58,920
swing

2521
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:00,719
um that uh the buffering of the soil and

2522
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:02,940
if you're generally trying to stay near

2523
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:05,340
neutral anyway

2524
01:35:02,939 --> 01:35:07,559
um the watering that you're doing is not

2525
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:09,960
really all that impactful on the roots

2526
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:11,840
on the pH level because it's the the

2527
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,100
system is more or less going to

2528
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:16,199
self-regulate so long as there isn't

2529
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:18,120
something like really wild happening

2530
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:20,519
yeah pretty much and I will I will put

2531
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:22,619
the caveat in there that um Hydroponics

2532
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:24,780
is a little bit different and I've heard

2533
01:35:22,619 --> 01:35:27,300
multiple opinions about whether to pH

2534
01:35:24,779 --> 01:35:28,559
your hydroponic feed or not I personally

2535
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:31,560
do

2536
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:35,039
um because it's hard to especially over

2537
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:36,600
time it's hard to tell what

2538
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:39,238
um the soil or whatever Medium you're

2539
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:42,120
watering into has retained and so making

2540
01:35:39,238 --> 01:35:44,339
sure that your your nutrients are the

2541
01:35:42,119 --> 01:35:46,619
the pH they should be at before they go

2542
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:47,579
in sort of helps if your soil is out of

2543
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:49,920
whack

2544
01:35:47,579 --> 01:35:52,260
um but that's some people don't and they

2545
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,940
seem to find it works fine so again it

2546
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:55,139
might just be like like we were talking

2547
01:35:53,939 --> 01:35:56,879
about earlier all these things that we

2548
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:58,739
do because someone else told us to do it

2549
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,900
yeah totally um it might not matter in

2550
01:35:58,738 --> 01:36:03,178
the end right on let's talk about

2551
01:36:00,899 --> 01:36:05,939
temperature so there's a lot of

2552
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:09,239
different variables that can impact the

2553
01:36:05,939 --> 01:36:11,519
temperature of the substrate in the

2554
01:36:09,238 --> 01:36:12,839
container this isn't something that we

2555
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,060
need to worry about in soil because

2556
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:17,579
geothermal takes care of any plants that

2557
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:20,940
are actually in the ground but um you

2558
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:24,179
know a a dark colored pots are are going

2559
01:36:20,939 --> 01:36:25,439
to attract and hold more of the sun's

2560
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:28,319
heat

2561
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:31,319
um we've got uh greenhouses and and

2562
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:33,658
Tents outside that can uh get

2563
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:37,738
exceptionally hot on on really hot days

2564
01:36:33,658 --> 01:36:41,339
even if we are I've got fans in them and

2565
01:36:37,738 --> 01:36:44,579
uh I run into this on my on my deck

2566
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:48,420
because uh the the hours right before

2567
01:36:44,579 --> 01:36:52,198
the sun goes down my deck will get up to

2568
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:55,199
you know 95 115 like way up there on a

2569
01:36:52,198 --> 01:36:57,479
hot day and and any plants that I have

2570
01:36:55,198 --> 01:37:00,119
on my deck will just will just cook I I

2571
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:03,539
just imagine the the root zones just

2572
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:06,779
like turning to Mush so um I'm sure that

2573
01:37:03,539 --> 01:37:09,779
there is a range though where

2574
01:37:06,779 --> 01:37:12,599
um you know the temperature of the root

2575
01:37:09,779 --> 01:37:15,059
zone is Optimum so would you kind of

2576
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:18,300
talk about what temperature range makes

2577
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:19,860
sense for the root Zone and I don't know

2578
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,360
I guess I guess the only way we would

2579
01:37:19,859 --> 01:37:24,779
know on a hot day would be to actually

2580
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:28,319
throw a probe in there yeah so I guess

2581
01:37:24,779 --> 01:37:30,179
the first part I would mention is so

2582
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:31,500
it's kind of insulating

2583
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:32,940
um and again this kind of goes back to

2584
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,738
your growing method like if you're a

2585
01:37:32,939 --> 01:37:37,019
bare root ball hanging in Hydroponics

2586
01:37:34,738 --> 01:37:38,579
that's going to be way more important

2587
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:40,980
um on on a deck or something like that

2588
01:37:38,579 --> 01:37:43,500
like I think the same range that you'd

2589
01:37:40,979 --> 01:37:46,019
expect the plant to grow in so like 30

2590
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:48,899
or I guess I'm in Celsius

2591
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:51,060
um I think like around like a mild

2592
01:37:48,899 --> 01:37:53,519
spring summer day would be fine

2593
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:56,400
obviously if you're getting up to

2594
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:58,199
really really hot summer days you're

2595
01:37:56,399 --> 01:38:00,299
gonna start seeing some effects but the

2596
01:37:58,198 --> 01:38:01,919
soil does buffer it it both hangs onto

2597
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,539
heat but also protects it a little bit

2598
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:05,639
and most of the time when we're looking

2599
01:38:03,539 --> 01:38:07,859
at I guess the second part is when we're

2600
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:11,579
looking at heat stress on a plant most

2601
01:38:07,859 --> 01:38:14,279
of what's happening is water so the heat

2602
01:38:11,579 --> 01:38:15,359
is is causing them to photosynthesize

2603
01:38:14,279 --> 01:38:16,979
more

2604
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:19,259
um they're losing more water because

2605
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:22,198
that's a direct part of photosynthesis

2606
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:24,900
is to lose water and because it's

2607
01:38:22,198 --> 01:38:26,579
happening at a faster rate in heat and

2608
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:27,899
and they're also getting cooked at the

2609
01:38:26,579 --> 01:38:30,539
same time so their leaves are kind of

2610
01:38:27,899 --> 01:38:32,039
not happy it can put a lot of water

2611
01:38:30,539 --> 01:38:33,899
stress on a plant so that's why you

2612
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:36,060
might see wilting or burning or those

2613
01:38:33,899 --> 01:38:38,039
kind of things and so if it's a hot day

2614
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:39,900
I think the best way to keep the

2615
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:41,639
insulating properties of the soil would

2616
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:43,500
just be to water more because the water

2617
01:38:41,639 --> 01:38:45,060
is going to take up some time to to

2618
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,380
properly heat up it's also going to be

2619
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,820
providing for the fact that the leaves

2620
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:50,219
are transpiring more and it's going to

2621
01:38:47,819 --> 01:38:52,139
keep the roots a little cooler on hot

2622
01:38:50,219 --> 01:38:56,060
days like this it's kind of generally

2623
01:38:52,139 --> 01:39:00,300
accepted that it's better to uh water

2624
01:38:56,060 --> 01:39:02,159
more times less water during a hot day

2625
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,900
because

2626
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:05,939
um you don't want to say oh it's a hot

2627
01:39:03,899 --> 01:39:10,138
day I'm going to water more and just go

2628
01:39:05,939 --> 01:39:12,119
with more volume because now not only is

2629
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:15,779
the plant trying to take up water but

2630
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:19,139
you've kind of like in you know

2631
01:39:15,779 --> 01:39:21,359
um flooded the substrate and and it's it

2632
01:39:19,139 --> 01:39:23,279
there's like almost too much water and

2633
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:24,539
it has to it has to deal with moving the

2634
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:26,939
water around at the same time it's

2635
01:39:24,539 --> 01:39:29,100
trying to take on water would you agree

2636
01:39:26,939 --> 01:39:31,379
with that best practice that you know

2637
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:34,320
instead of doing your same two waterings

2638
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:37,440
a day but you know make them larger in

2639
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:39,359
volume instead you know do the do maybe

2640
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:40,979
even less than you would on a normal day

2641
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:42,059
but break it up into maybe four

2642
01:39:40,979 --> 01:39:43,919
waterings

2643
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:45,420
I feel like there's a couple options

2644
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,639
there because usually when I'm dealing

2645
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:50,699
with plants that are outside that are

2646
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:53,039
like it's a heat Dome or whatever I

2647
01:39:50,698 --> 01:39:55,799
water more in early morning when it's

2648
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:57,119
not hot so that the plant can I guess if

2649
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,219
you want to call it water balance like

2650
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:01,019
then it's not already water stressed

2651
01:39:59,219 --> 01:40:02,819
when the heat hits

2652
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:05,639
and then I probably would check more

2653
01:40:02,819 --> 01:40:07,500
because I I don't know if if you like if

2654
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:09,539
it's best practices and people tend to

2655
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,800
follow that rule I'm far be it for me to

2656
01:40:09,539 --> 01:40:12,539
go against that

2657
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,520
um but I do think that it's less about

2658
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:16,198
like the volume of water I think I think

2659
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:18,600
especially in pots there's only so much

2660
01:40:16,198 --> 01:40:22,198
water that you can put in there per soil

2661
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:24,000
amount but it evaporates really fast so

2662
01:40:22,198 --> 01:40:26,279
I would say that it's better to water

2663
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,960
more frequently and then maybe you don't

2664
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:29,579
have to add as much water but like in a

2665
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:31,079
pot on the on a patio there's only so

2666
01:40:29,579 --> 01:40:32,819
much water that can fit in there and

2667
01:40:31,079 --> 01:40:34,619
it's not gonna be enough to keep it like

2668
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:37,738
cool throughout the whole day

2669
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:39,179
and and the amount of water is probably

2670
01:40:37,738 --> 01:40:41,218
going to also change about whether or

2671
01:40:39,179 --> 01:40:43,319
not you're in a hard-walled plastic or

2672
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:45,960
if you are in a fabric pot too because

2673
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:48,238
those fabric pots they just get all hot

2674
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:50,760
and they they start to you know lose

2675
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:53,299
water out the sides pretty fast

2676
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,300
yeah then

2677
01:40:54,899 --> 01:40:58,799
soil there is

2678
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:01,198
or if you're in in soil in the ground

2679
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,060
like a good watering first thing in the

2680
01:41:01,198 --> 01:41:04,500
morning before it actually gets really

2681
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,480
really hot you might have to check on it

2682
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:08,340
part way through the day hard wall like

2683
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:10,678
I was mentioning but yeah absolutely for

2684
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:12,000
fabric putts because they evaporate out

2685
01:41:10,679 --> 01:41:14,760
the sides as well they're just not going

2686
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,260
to retain as much as much water so yeah

2687
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,520
and in which case like you're going to

2688
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:20,460
be watering again in two hours anyway

2689
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,719
you don't need to flood the part yeah

2690
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:25,139
um right on

2691
01:41:21,719 --> 01:41:27,779
um let's talk a little bit about

2692
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:29,940
um uh supplements you know there are

2693
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:31,979
there are different types of fungal

2694
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:33,658
supplements that are sold that people

2695
01:41:31,979 --> 01:41:37,919
say to

2696
01:41:33,658 --> 01:41:40,799
um you know uh mix into your soil so

2697
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:45,118
that when you transplant a pot the The

2698
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:48,539
Roots will interact with the um with the

2699
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:50,759
supplemented uh fungi and will support

2700
01:41:48,539 --> 01:41:54,060
root growth you know essentially the the

2701
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:54,780
the the the connection with the

2702
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:56,760
um

2703
01:41:54,779 --> 01:41:59,519
between the root hair and the supplement

2704
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:02,940
will wake up the supplement and and that

2705
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:04,320
that fungal presence will will ease the

2706
01:42:02,939 --> 01:42:06,299
transition

2707
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:08,698
um of the plant

2708
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:12,199
um do you see that happening and and

2709
01:42:08,698 --> 01:42:12,198
does that kind of support make sense

2710
01:42:12,539 --> 01:42:16,260
an extent but it depends like we were

2711
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:19,019
talking earlier about the system that

2712
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:21,300
you're coming from and into so

2713
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:23,219
it does take some time if we're talking

2714
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:25,020
about like mycorrhizal inoculum or

2715
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:26,819
something like that it does take time

2716
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:28,380
for that process to happen because like

2717
01:42:26,819 --> 01:42:30,539
I was alluding to earlier it's a

2718
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:32,460
conversation between this fungus that's

2719
01:42:30,539 --> 01:42:34,198
trying to help out and meets the plant

2720
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:37,380
and the plant which has to prepare

2721
01:42:34,198 --> 01:42:39,738
itself to accept the fungus so it can be

2722
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:41,960
helpful to get that going early

2723
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:44,459
but it really only makes sense

2724
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:46,859
especially for fungus I would say if

2725
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:48,840
you're going to then put it into a pot

2726
01:42:46,859 --> 01:42:49,979
where it's not going to be disturbed or

2727
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:52,800
into the garden where it's not going to

2728
01:42:49,979 --> 01:42:53,939
be disturbed and I also think it depends

2729
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:56,279
on the health of the system you're

2730
01:42:53,939 --> 01:42:58,439
planting into like in a pot we have good

2731
01:42:56,279 --> 01:43:01,198
control over compost and stuff like that

2732
01:42:58,439 --> 01:43:02,819
but it's a real old Garden remedy to put

2733
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:05,759
a little extra stuff in there when you

2734
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:07,259
transplant into maybe not as Rich of a

2735
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,179
soil or something like that to give it a

2736
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:11,100
kick start and I would say if you're

2737
01:43:09,179 --> 01:43:12,539
doing that with inoculum too and you're

2738
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:14,340
not confident that the health of the

2739
01:43:12,539 --> 01:43:16,019
soil you're planting into is is that

2740
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:18,300
great then I'm sure that would give it a

2741
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:20,219
little boost and with bacteria I think

2742
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:22,079
bacteria are a little a little bit

2743
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:23,760
a little bit more broad because they

2744
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:25,859
again they don't they don't have those

2745
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:28,079
like root type structures like the

2746
01:43:25,859 --> 01:43:29,939
hyphae um they don't have that hyphae

2747
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:31,198
like the fungus do so they're more

2748
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:33,539
likely to just kind of build up a little

2749
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:35,759
film somewhere and that's probably

2750
01:43:33,539 --> 01:43:37,618
easier to water in in different systems

2751
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,260
or more systems it might apply to more

2752
01:43:37,618 --> 01:43:43,618
systems but um I think there's there's

2753
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:45,900
no harm in trying I just again some

2754
01:43:43,618 --> 01:43:48,658
systems are just not that set up to

2755
01:43:45,899 --> 01:43:51,238
support it afterwards in the first set

2756
01:43:48,658 --> 01:43:53,460
you you mentioned uh uh two or three

2757
01:43:51,238 --> 01:43:54,899
different simple teas that you like to

2758
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:57,960
use

2759
01:43:54,899 --> 01:43:59,519
um for nutrition for the root Zone I was

2760
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,158
curious whether or not you have any of

2761
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:04,619
those simple recipes for beneficial

2762
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:05,759
bacteria to improve the root growth

2763
01:44:04,618 --> 01:44:07,920
because you've mentioned beneficial

2764
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:10,500
bacteria a couple different times as

2765
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:13,920
playing you know an important role of

2766
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:16,319
both helping the The Roots Thrive but

2767
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,420
also Breaking Down nutrition for the

2768
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:19,799
entirety of the root Zone

2769
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:21,840
um I don't know if there is such a thing

2770
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:24,719
I'm just kind of fishing here but but do

2771
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:27,300
you have a beneficial bacteria prep that

2772
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:28,800
can be uh poured into the pot and and

2773
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:30,960
will help out

2774
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,239
yeah I think um I think there's a bunch

2775
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:35,279
of good recipes online but what we often

2776
01:44:33,238 --> 01:44:37,138
do um and what we do actually in

2777
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:37,859
research about

2778
01:44:37,139 --> 01:44:40,618
um

2779
01:44:37,859 --> 01:44:43,319
uh beneficial bacteria and how it helps

2780
01:44:40,618 --> 01:44:45,179
the root is to take soil or compost

2781
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:49,019
that's already full of all the microbes

2782
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:51,600
you need and then put it into some very

2783
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:53,639
well aerated water

2784
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:55,560
um and then you can add a sugar source

2785
01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:58,319
of some kind depending I know people

2786
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,780
talk a lot and this is also very I guess

2787
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:03,779
veers into sort of compost literature

2788
01:45:00,779 --> 01:45:05,639
but you can get like green compost and

2789
01:45:03,779 --> 01:45:07,500
brown compost and those will have

2790
01:45:05,639 --> 01:45:08,760
different types of microbial communities

2791
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:11,520
in them

2792
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:13,320
um and so you can you can

2793
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,300
be pretty confident that if you're

2794
01:45:13,319 --> 01:45:17,399
taking a sample from a healthy soil and

2795
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:19,139
providing it food like a sugar source

2796
01:45:17,399 --> 01:45:20,579
that you're going to get a lot of

2797
01:45:19,139 --> 01:45:22,319
beneficial organisms including

2798
01:45:20,579 --> 01:45:24,300
beneficial bacteria so that's usually

2799
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:26,519
what we do with like a good couple of

2800
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:27,900
composts a little bit of molasses like I

2801
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:29,699
was saying earlier

2802
01:45:27,899 --> 01:45:31,799
um and then some something for it to

2803
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:33,118
nibble on like leaves or like I was

2804
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:34,260
talking about earlier brackenfone and

2805
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:35,519
stuff like that and depending on the

2806
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:38,039
race ratio you're going to get different

2807
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:40,440
stuff now are you talking about a brewed

2808
01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:42,600
compost tea in that and that uh point

2809
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:44,339
because the the delineation I'm trying

2810
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:48,179
to make is

2811
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:51,600
um uh you know adding molasses to

2812
01:45:48,179 --> 01:45:54,000
um a a compost Brewer if you're going to

2813
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,500
let it run for you know 36 hours or

2814
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,020
something and so you're going to

2815
01:45:55,500 --> 01:46:00,479
incubate those microbes or in this case

2816
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:04,080
bacteria that we want

2817
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:07,259
um and then and then uh root drench that

2818
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:10,139
into the pot that's one use of molasses

2819
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:12,659
but then I also have been hearing folks

2820
01:46:10,139 --> 01:46:15,420
talk about oh I want to feed my microbes

2821
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:19,559
and so they're they're pouring you know

2822
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:22,380
molasses or a water molasses slurry into

2823
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:25,139
the pot directly which that sounds super

2824
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:27,480
scary and unbalancing to me versus in

2825
01:46:25,139 --> 01:46:30,420
the first example we're going to add

2826
01:46:27,479 --> 01:46:33,718
enough molasses that's going to feed the

2827
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:35,279
the microbin bacteria communities and

2828
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:37,380
then we're going to to pour it in the

2829
01:46:35,279 --> 01:46:39,238
pot which is going to decrease the I

2830
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:40,739
don't know hotness if you will of the

2831
01:46:39,238 --> 01:46:43,138
molasses

2832
01:46:40,738 --> 01:46:45,479
I guess I guess like I

2833
01:46:43,139 --> 01:46:47,039
I just assumed we were talking about

2834
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:48,479
culture

2835
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:49,679
um which is my bad I should have I

2836
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:53,099
should have clarified

2837
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:55,618
um when I use compost tea my idea is

2838
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:58,079
usually based off of um I know a lot of

2839
01:46:55,618 --> 01:46:59,519
people do this too that you're taking a

2840
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:01,439
small amount of something and trying to

2841
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,739
encourage growth of that something into

2842
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:06,960
a supplement you can just water in

2843
01:47:04,738 --> 01:47:08,819
compost water and it will do just fine

2844
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,198
and it might take a little longer but

2845
01:47:08,819 --> 01:47:12,479
remembering that a lot of these bacteria

2846
01:47:10,198 --> 01:47:14,219
and fungus like they eat the stuff

2847
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:15,599
that's already in your soil so like

2848
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:17,760
rather than add molasses you could

2849
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:19,679
probably add Leaf litter or compost or

2850
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,760
something like that to help them because

2851
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:22,079
that's what they're eating at the end of

2852
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:24,539
the day so when I'm talking about

2853
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:27,059
molasses and aerated teas I'm definitely

2854
01:47:24,539 --> 01:47:30,179
talking about a brewing tea where you're

2855
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:31,920
trying to grow microbes for watering in

2856
01:47:30,179 --> 01:47:34,500
later great I just wanted to make that

2857
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:37,739
delineation really sharp since we talk

2858
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:40,560
about both aerated compost teas and then

2859
01:47:37,738 --> 01:47:43,859
compost extracts right which won't be

2860
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,600
aerated and I don't want anybody to get

2861
01:47:43,859 --> 01:47:47,880
those confused and just like you know

2862
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:49,920
Freebase molasses into their pot you

2863
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:53,460
know because because it happens

2864
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:55,079
unfortunately I I and then and and then

2865
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:56,698
and then they get a decent plant and

2866
01:47:55,079 --> 01:47:59,279
then now they swear by it right it's

2867
01:47:56,698 --> 01:48:01,979
like oh but that's that's dangerous so

2868
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:03,300
oh yeah and like Superstition you you

2869
01:48:01,979 --> 01:48:05,459
know you have the things that make you

2870
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:07,739
work and and like if if it worked for

2871
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:09,840
you you're much less likely to not do

2872
01:48:07,738 --> 01:48:11,939
exactly what you just did because it did

2873
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:14,699
already work for you and there isn't

2874
01:48:11,939 --> 01:48:15,899
really any harm in watering composting

2875
01:48:14,698 --> 01:48:16,919
because it's already got all these

2876
01:48:15,899 --> 01:48:18,658
nutrients if anything you're just

2877
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:20,760
freeing up the loose nutrients that were

2878
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:22,618
already free in the compost and watering

2879
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:24,539
them through your soil column and then

2880
01:48:22,618 --> 01:48:26,880
and then you also have all those little

2881
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:30,420
microbes that come with so if you don't

2882
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:32,460
have an aerated compost set up

2883
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:34,139
um for Brewing compost tees you can

2884
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,399
certainly just take a couple of handfuls

2885
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:36,960
of compost put it on top and water

2886
01:48:35,399 --> 01:48:37,979
through and it'll do the same thing it

2887
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,899
might just take a little longer because

2888
01:48:37,979 --> 01:48:42,238
you haven't encouraged that the growth

2889
01:48:39,899 --> 01:48:44,879
of those microbes in the same way I

2890
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:46,799
don't know about the sugar I tend to

2891
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,840
agree with the like it might be it might

2892
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:52,560
get things a little toasty in there yeah

2893
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:53,699
right on so before I go to the the last

2894
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:56,219
question

2895
01:48:53,698 --> 01:48:57,599
um of our chat um I want to just throw a

2896
01:48:56,219 --> 01:49:00,300
wide net here

2897
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:02,159
um uh is there anything else that we

2898
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:05,219
haven't talked about today that can be

2899
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:08,759
done uh to support

2900
01:49:05,219 --> 01:49:10,679
um a healthy root life and root growth

2901
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:13,619
um this is I just want to mop up any

2902
01:49:10,679 --> 01:49:17,219
other best practices that I may not have

2903
01:49:13,618 --> 01:49:19,618
known to ask you but you because

2904
01:49:17,219 --> 01:49:21,779
um because you are rudely uh you you you

2905
01:49:19,618 --> 01:49:23,939
might know so is there is there anything

2906
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:25,439
else that you uh would suggest or

2907
01:49:23,939 --> 01:49:27,539
recommend

2908
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:28,799
I think I think we've kind of covered a

2909
01:49:27,539 --> 01:49:30,719
lot of areas that I would talk about

2910
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,600
with root health but I think one big one

2911
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:36,420
is like trying to avoid disturbing the

2912
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:38,760
root system and and really going for

2913
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:40,859
some sort of balance because I feel like

2914
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:42,659
we often just kind of manhandle them

2915
01:49:40,859 --> 01:49:44,039
they're this mysterious thing under

2916
01:49:42,658 --> 01:49:46,679
there that we don't really think about

2917
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:49,079
and if you're gonna go for a healthy

2918
01:49:46,679 --> 01:49:51,779
plant you need both a healthy top half

2919
01:49:49,079 --> 01:49:53,698
and bottom half so being gentle with

2920
01:49:51,779 --> 01:49:54,960
them trying to trying to think about the

2921
01:49:53,698 --> 01:49:56,939
different things that you can do to

2922
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,719
support them especially the watering

2923
01:49:56,939 --> 01:49:59,158
part

2924
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:01,380
um we don't want stressed out roots so

2925
01:49:59,158 --> 01:50:03,299
making sure that you're keeping them wet

2926
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:05,639
and able to do their job I think that's

2927
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:07,260
a big one but I think I think all the

2928
01:50:05,639 --> 01:50:09,300
things we've talked about today are good

2929
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:10,440
ways to try and promote root health but

2930
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:12,480
at the end of the day it's up to the

2931
01:50:10,439 --> 01:50:14,279
plant and you can usually tell if the

2932
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:16,319
top half is healthy the bottom half is

2933
01:50:14,279 --> 01:50:17,819
probably pretty good too right on it

2934
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,920
does seem like you know we keep on

2935
01:50:17,819 --> 01:50:22,799
coming back to the thing that arcano's

2936
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:26,279
plants like uh the most is balance and

2937
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:28,500
consistency right if you can go slow and

2938
01:50:26,279 --> 01:50:30,420
steady you know do the same thing every

2939
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:33,539
day and try to keep it a consistent

2940
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:35,158
environment while that is so hard you

2941
01:50:33,539 --> 01:50:37,679
know based on our different bio regions

2942
01:50:35,158 --> 01:50:40,259
it is the name of the game absolutely

2943
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:42,480
and especially I guess the other thing I

2944
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:44,340
would mention is we focus very much

2945
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:46,379
especially on a plant like cannabis

2946
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:49,020
where we have an end yield that we're

2947
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:50,579
really interested in that it's you still

2948
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:52,679
have to respect the process of growing

2949
01:50:50,579 --> 01:50:54,238
it and making sure that the whole plant

2950
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:55,980
is healthy because at the end of the day

2951
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:58,259
that one little part of the plant you're

2952
01:50:55,979 --> 01:51:00,599
concerned about relies on all of the

2953
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:02,699
rest of the plant to grow properly and

2954
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:04,800
in the way that we want so don't neglect

2955
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:06,899
your roots yeah amen right on all right

2956
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:09,179
so for this this last question it's it's

2957
01:51:06,899 --> 01:51:10,379
fun it it is still a root question but

2958
01:51:09,179 --> 01:51:12,420
it's coming from a totally different

2959
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:13,618
direction so

2960
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:16,380
um all the way back like I don't know

2961
01:51:13,618 --> 01:51:19,559
four four or five years ago or so on a

2962
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:23,279
shaping Fire episode 26 I interviewed

2963
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:25,320
your neighbor up there in uh BC Natasha

2964
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:28,618
Riz uh are you are you familiar with

2965
01:51:25,319 --> 01:51:30,359
Natasha I am oh quite a few nice dinners

2966
01:51:28,618 --> 01:51:32,759
together excellent well we like her too

2967
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:35,639
and um and when we had her on the show

2968
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:39,480
to talk about root ball medicine because

2969
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:42,920
the Cannabis roots are filled with with

2970
01:51:39,479 --> 01:51:46,138
all sorts of cannabis

2971
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:47,779
biochemicals I I'll guess I'll say that

2972
01:51:46,139 --> 01:51:51,539
do things like

2973
01:51:47,779 --> 01:51:53,639
reduce inflammation and and and other

2974
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:56,939
things that we tend to use the tops of

2975
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:58,500
the cannabis plant for and and there are

2976
01:51:56,939 --> 01:52:00,299
these biochemicals like there's

2977
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:04,819
triterpenes in there and the one that

2978
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:04,820
most people focus on is Friedland

2979
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:09,060
f-r-i-e-d-e-l-i-n for anybody who that's

2980
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:10,618
new but then there's also a whole bunch

2981
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:12,960
of other ones which I could totally

2982
01:52:10,618 --> 01:52:15,118
butcher the names of but the point I

2983
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:17,760
want to get to is that

2984
01:52:15,118 --> 01:52:19,500
um since that show I have had audience

2985
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,960
folks from across the country reach out

2986
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:25,139
to me and say hey we've started making

2987
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:26,698
these tinctures and salves from the

2988
01:52:25,139 --> 01:52:28,020
Cannabis root Zone and we're getting

2989
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:30,719
really good

2990
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:34,320
um effects from them but we want to know

2991
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:38,219
how to grow roots that have gotten more

2992
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:41,399
of these various sterols and alkaloids

2993
01:52:38,219 --> 01:52:43,500
and try by terpenes and these these

2994
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:46,259
these useful delicious medicinal

2995
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:49,618
biochemicals and they ask me what can I

2996
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:53,100
do for the plant so that so that my

2997
01:52:49,618 --> 01:52:55,139
roots are more rich with these these

2998
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:58,079
these Target

2999
01:52:55,139 --> 01:52:59,639
um you know Biologicals and you know I

3000
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:01,859
don't have an answer for that except to

3001
01:52:59,639 --> 01:53:05,159
say you know a thriving plant will

3002
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:08,460
probably produce more of those like it

3003
01:53:05,158 --> 01:53:10,198
does more resin and more terpenes but

3004
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:11,698
like I don't know like I just made I

3005
01:53:10,198 --> 01:53:13,738
just made that up I just given my best

3006
01:53:11,698 --> 01:53:16,019
educated guess right

3007
01:53:13,738 --> 01:53:17,579
um but um this is so similar to the kind

3008
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:20,280
of research that you're doing I'm

3009
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:21,738
wondering if you have a more educated

3010
01:53:20,279 --> 01:53:26,118
guess

3011
01:53:21,738 --> 01:53:26,118
I actually love this question I

3012
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:34,739
I'm trying to use plants like plant

3013
01:53:33,179 --> 01:53:36,840
processes that the plant already

3014
01:53:34,738 --> 01:53:38,218
performs

3015
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:41,279
um to try and

3016
01:53:38,219 --> 01:53:42,719
find things that are medicinal about it

3017
01:53:41,279 --> 01:53:45,420
um and this kind of

3018
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:46,920
does exactly that so when we think of

3019
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:48,899
the different types of molecules that we

3020
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:51,539
find medicinal in a plant they often

3021
01:53:48,899 --> 01:53:54,179
have some sort of what we call a broadly

3022
01:53:51,539 --> 01:53:56,639
bioactivity which just means that it has

3023
01:53:54,179 --> 01:53:58,380
some sort of job that it can do in a

3024
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:59,880
biological system and like a common

3025
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:02,219
example of that might be like an

3026
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:05,159
antibiotic like if we take it we get rid

3027
01:54:02,219 --> 01:54:06,899
of an infection hooray and it's usually

3028
01:54:05,158 --> 01:54:09,059
from something that is also trying to

3029
01:54:06,899 --> 01:54:11,819
fight off an infection so a lot of our

3030
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:13,260
antibiotics might be from derived from a

3031
01:54:11,819 --> 01:54:15,179
bacteria that was trying to fight off

3032
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:17,340
another bacteria we found what it worked

3033
01:54:15,179 --> 01:54:19,440
so we use it same with antifungals and

3034
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:22,260
things like that so

3035
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:24,719
my work is mostly trying to decide okay

3036
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:28,260
if this is something that plants already

3037
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:29,698
make these molecules for what if we

3038
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:31,320
stress them out a little bit in this way

3039
01:54:29,698 --> 01:54:33,839
so for example if you wanted an

3040
01:54:31,319 --> 01:54:35,158
antibiotic then you maybe give it a

3041
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:36,900
little bit of an infection or something

3042
01:54:35,158 --> 01:54:39,839
like that because then it might make

3043
01:54:36,899 --> 01:54:42,299
more of that antibiotic for you

3044
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:44,219
um I don't know how this translates to

3045
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:45,840
root medicine necessarily because a lot

3046
01:54:44,219 --> 01:54:48,179
of these things we don't fully

3047
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:49,980
understand

3048
01:54:48,179 --> 01:54:51,539
um what they do like we know that when

3049
01:54:49,979 --> 01:54:53,099
we take them they have a lot of

3050
01:54:51,539 --> 01:54:55,219
medicinal aspects and especially with

3051
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:57,840
cannabinoids they have so many different

3052
01:54:55,219 --> 01:55:00,359
things that they do for us that they've

3053
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:03,199
like they've been all sorts of different

3054
01:55:00,359 --> 01:55:05,698
things that we have found out about them

3055
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:08,460
but a lot of those aren't things that

3056
01:55:05,698 --> 01:55:10,198
plants do right like they don't like for

3057
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:11,880
anti-seizure for example like plants

3058
01:55:10,198 --> 01:55:13,198
don't have seizures so we can't make

3059
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:15,060
them have a seizure to make more of that

3060
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:16,799
but for some of these things like that

3061
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:19,560
molecule you're just talking about

3062
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,900
if it has an anti-fungal activity or

3063
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:26,400
something like that then then maybe a

3064
01:55:21,899 --> 01:55:28,679
plant that has a fungal um problem might

3065
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:30,839
be good and then the other thing would

3066
01:55:28,679 --> 01:55:32,819
be we don't want plants that are too

3067
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:34,260
stressed out though because it still

3068
01:55:32,819 --> 01:55:36,479
needs to have energy to fight off

3069
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:38,699
whatever you're giving it

3070
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:39,419
um so it might be something where you

3071
01:55:38,698 --> 01:55:42,719
can

3072
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:44,699
um just expose it to any bacteria like

3073
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:46,260
maybe a compost tea and maybe it has

3074
01:55:44,698 --> 01:55:48,960
some friends and maybe some not so

3075
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:50,760
friendly bacteria in the compost tea and

3076
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:53,039
maybe that will stimulate it to make a

3077
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:54,659
little something extra and I'm I'm just

3078
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:56,819
going to put the caveat that I'm not

3079
01:55:54,658 --> 01:55:59,339
telling you to go out and like try and

3080
01:55:56,819 --> 01:56:01,139
make your plant super sick right don't

3081
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:03,060
be serum in them or something right yeah

3082
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:04,440
please don't do that but there's ways

3083
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:07,739
that we can stay with our own bodies

3084
01:56:04,439 --> 01:56:10,259
like um being exposed to outside and and

3085
01:56:07,738 --> 01:56:11,638
those kind of things or eating organic

3086
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:13,380
foods that have things on them and those

3087
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:15,239
kind of things like we know that um that

3088
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:17,760
if we're too sterile our systems aren't

3089
01:56:15,238 --> 01:56:21,718
happy so maybe the suggestion would be

3090
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:22,860
to just feed them some compost teas and

3091
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:24,179
some of the stuff that we've been

3092
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:25,559
talking about today

3093
01:56:24,179 --> 01:56:27,359
um so that the roots are not only

3094
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:29,219
healthy but also are interacting with

3095
01:56:27,359 --> 01:56:31,259
other organisms and then maybe that will

3096
01:56:29,219 --> 01:56:32,939
stimulate more of a response just to

3097
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:34,079
guess yeah yeah I like that guess um

3098
01:56:32,939 --> 01:56:36,539
while you were saying that I thought

3099
01:56:34,079 --> 01:56:40,319
maybe maybe we could get that from from

3100
01:56:36,539 --> 01:56:42,359
watering in some non-local

3101
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:43,979
indigenous microorganisms right I mean

3102
01:56:42,359 --> 01:56:46,559
we talk about imos all the time and how

3103
01:56:43,979 --> 01:56:49,379
much we love them and how how helpful it

3104
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:53,520
is to use localized ones well well maybe

3105
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:55,199
if we were to to use some IMO from a

3106
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:57,540
different environment since that will

3107
01:56:55,198 --> 01:57:00,359
have a whole bunch of strangers to this

3108
01:56:57,539 --> 01:57:04,079
environment maybe you can get a similar

3109
01:57:00,359 --> 01:57:08,039
uh defensive medicinal capability

3110
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:10,260
um without having to go so far as to you

3111
01:57:08,039 --> 01:57:12,238
know actually cause damage to the root

3112
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:14,639
Zone just just threaten it

3113
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:16,500
yeah and like this might even be like we

3114
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:19,020
we know that microbial communities are

3115
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:21,479
pretty local and like even maybe local

3116
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:23,040
to your garden versus like across the

3117
01:57:21,479 --> 01:57:24,718
street down the hall so maybe it's just

3118
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:26,579
as simple as like if you live next to a

3119
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:28,020
bunch of oak trees and your friend lives

3120
01:57:26,579 --> 01:57:30,000
next to a bunch of pine trees maybe you

3121
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:32,040
just get some soil from there and water

3122
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,539
it in right on cool well thanks thanks

3123
01:57:32,039 --> 01:57:34,859
for going down that theoretical line

3124
01:57:33,539 --> 01:57:37,260
with me just because

3125
01:57:34,859 --> 01:57:38,698
um you know you're you're you're my root

3126
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:40,440
expert and I mean I know I'm gonna be

3127
01:57:38,698 --> 01:57:42,779
getting this question more and so at

3128
01:57:40,439 --> 01:57:44,519
least I've got you know more to say even

3129
01:57:42,779 --> 01:57:46,800
though we don't know exactly what it is

3130
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:48,540
so thanks for that no problem and thank

3131
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:51,060
you Sarah for joining us again you know

3132
01:57:48,539 --> 01:57:52,560
I'm so glad that we got a chance to uh

3133
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:55,199
continue the conversation that we

3134
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:57,000
started in episode 99 about Roots

3135
01:57:55,198 --> 01:58:00,779
because there really is so much there

3136
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:04,500
and that really showed me how much I

3137
01:58:00,779 --> 01:58:06,658
take the The Roots themselves for

3138
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:08,520
um for granted I talk a lot about the

3139
01:58:06,658 --> 01:58:10,679
rhizosphere in the root Zone and the

3140
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:12,719
community and all that but specifically

3141
01:58:10,679 --> 01:58:14,579
The Roots I just kind of I just kind of

3142
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:16,739
take them for granted and and the more

3143
01:58:14,579 --> 01:58:19,439
questions I asked last time we talked

3144
01:58:16,738 --> 01:58:22,259
the more I realized I didn't know so so

3145
01:58:19,439 --> 01:58:24,299
thank you so much for um for joining us

3146
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:27,420
and sharing your you know good cheer and

3147
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:29,760
expertise and um and and helping us uh

3148
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:32,158
Rock a little more about what's going on

3149
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:33,599
um underneath the surface in our pots so

3150

Sarah Lane or just to kind of follow her

3155
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:47,098
along she doesn't do a lot of social

3156
01:58:45,179 --> 01:58:49,380
media because she's focused most of her

3157
01:58:47,099 --> 01:58:51,119
time on the research but uh there are

3158
