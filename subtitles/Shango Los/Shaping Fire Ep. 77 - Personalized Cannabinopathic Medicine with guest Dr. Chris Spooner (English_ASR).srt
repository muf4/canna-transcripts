2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,119
to folks on the outside who are not

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,638
familiar with cannabis the medicinal

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,320
qualities of the plant can appear

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,640
overblown in a pipe dream

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,560
quite literally and they are right that

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,439
most of us talk about cannabis as a

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,358
panacea

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,960
because it does offer relief from so

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,840
many bodily ailments

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,439
and those folks say how can one herb fix

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,160
so many things in a human

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,320
that simply cannot be true but the thing

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,119
is that cannabis really only does

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,480
one thing it balances and strengthens

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,320
and interacts with the body's

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,799
endocannabinoid system

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
balancing and activating that one system

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,919
is a very big deal though

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,840
because the endocannabinoid system

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
touches all the other mission critical

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,320
systems in the human body

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
at the same time though not all humans

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,799
react to cannabis in the same way

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,719
by now most cannabis users understand

26
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,718
how completely the terpene profile

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,640
controls the quality of euphoria

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,520
that cannabis gives us when smoked or

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,960
vaped and terpenes themselves influence

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,040
humans in differing ways

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,039
which is why some folks can smoke any

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,880
and all equatorial cultivars

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,200
while i have to be really picky with

34
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,399
mine or i get a racing heart that i find

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,118
dysphoric

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,920
we all have our very own personal and

37
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,920
individual relationship with cannabis

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,560
all this is to say that cannabis helps

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,280
the endocannabinoid system of all humans

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,118
but which cannabis cultivar used in

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,359
which way and at which dose are all

42
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,200
variable from human to human

43
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,680
it really makes me cringe to see

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,079
cannabis folks arguing on social media

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,159
about some patients dosing protocol

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,158
because to really understand how best to

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
administer cannabis to a patient

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,200
really takes a pretty in-depth patient

49
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,118
intake

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,880
or some advanced self-awareness and

51
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,280
self-diagnosing

52
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,438
folks are usually arguing as if dosing

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,478
is the same for everyone and it very

54
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,478
much isn't whole plant cannabis medicine

55
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,879
is a great tool and we need to recognize

56
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,799
how to use it is dictated to a large

57
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,839
degree by the physical health

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,600
nutrition expectations mental health

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,118
and experience with cannabis that the

60
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,359
patient has

61
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,639
every cannabis patient is different and

62
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
deserves to be treated uniquely

63
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,359

real people

96
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,878
every day today we're going to discuss

97
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,480
the wide range of variables at play in

98
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,199
the human body to consider

99
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,399
when making cannabis recommendations

100
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,878
during the first set

101
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,719
we talk about those body variables and

102
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,479
how unique each human is when it comes

103
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,479
to cannabis medicine

104
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,399
during the second set we review the

105
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,399
analytical tools and tests we can use

106
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,120
when performing a patient intake

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,840
or serious self-diagnosis and in the

108
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,239
third set

109
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,280
we talk about easy to access whole foods

110
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,439
that you can eat

111
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,560
to support a thriving endocannabinoid

112
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,759
system

113
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,719
welcome to the show chris hey shango

114
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,719
great to be here thanks

115
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,560
thank you so let's start by giving

116
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,438
everybody a really good idea of the

117
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,318
variables

118
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,158
at play when discussing the use of

119
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,719
cannabis medicine you know

120
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,840
humans are not at all the same even

121
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,000
though textbooks

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,000
about the human body and the discussion

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,560
of the endocannabinoid system

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,199
may suggest that they are so so let's

125
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,319
start would you

126
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,798
please give us a sense of the variety of

127
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,839
health

128
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,319
variables that could potentially impact

129
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,560
the use of cannabis medicine and should

130
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,680
be considered when choosing how best to

131
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,879
use cannabis

132
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,280
to relieve ailments

133
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,159
sure super interesting question you know

134
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,638
and this definitely

135
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,000
falls within kind of you know my my

136
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,759
integrative medicine

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,519
functional medicine naturopathic

138
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,199
medicine approach and

139
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,560
i don't uh you know this is an approach

140
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,840
that i use pretty much with all my

141
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
patients whether it be

142
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,439
cannabis medicine or not you know and

143
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
essentially

144
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,399
you know what we're really trying to do

145
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,240
is is recognize that you know you've got

146
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,519
individual patients and i think one of

147
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,000
the challenges that we have with

148
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,319
medicine

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,680
right now is that you know we're using

150
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,199
evidence-based medicine

151
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,439
we're trying to protocols and

152
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
standardization part of it

153
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,800
and and what we've forgotten is that

154
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,439
we're kind of creating medicine by

155
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,478
average

156
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,160
you know i was just having this

157
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,839
conversation with a patient yesterday i

158
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
was showing them some

159
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,638
a data set you know and some slides

160
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
saying okay well you know and there's

161
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,560
this nice graph

162
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,519
line down the middle of it you know but

163
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,478
you know when you take a look at the

164
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,319
number of points

165
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,079
data points that are actually on the the

166
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,360
best fit line there's only four

167
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,560
and the other 150 or above or below so

168
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,240
and that starts to become something

169
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
that's become a real sort of foundation

170
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,560
on how i work

171
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,079
you know with with patients on this

172
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,199
which is you know we need to recognize

173
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,079
and we've got to really dig

174
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,680
into these unique aspects of patience

175
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,879
you know and so

176
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,079
you know when i start off there's a

177
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,918
couple things that i take a look at

178
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,918
first and foremost and and you know sort

179
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,000
of a base of a pyramid and which ones

180
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,000
you know each one sort of successively

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,839
builds on the next and so

182
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,800
you know to me you know optimizing

183
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,318
nutrition is has got to be key in this

184
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,639
right you know and so

185
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,240
you know i think that well you know when

186
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,800
you start looking at the cannabinoids

187
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,319
and the endocannabinoids in particular

188
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
you know all of these things are are

189
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,720
basically you know built off fats

190
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,039
you know in our body and so you know our

191
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,759
you know the macronutrient part of it

192
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,918
you know the omega-3s omega-6 you know

193
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,680
saturated fat status

194
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,439
of our diets becomes really really

195
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,120
important you know because i think we

196
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,360
need to remember the endocannabinoid

197
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,439
system is a

198
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,280
homeostatic regulatory system

199
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,038
right which means that you know you can

200
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,638
only push it so far versus the other

201
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,478
it's actually a balancing thing so if

202
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,960
we're trying to create

203
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,399
a super intense therapeutic effect on it

204
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,719
i think we're going to cap that out

205
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,839
at both you know both ends of that along

206
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,319
the continuum of

207
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,839
you know one extreme versus the other so

208
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,560
we need to look at ways to build

209
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,478
capacity um within that and try to

210
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,478
unload it so that we allow the

211
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,439
endocannabinoid system to balance as

212
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,959
opposed to

213
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,478
push before before you move on um

214
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,680
you've all we're not even three minutes

215
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:58,719
into the show and you've already blown

216
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,319
my mind

217
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,599
did you did you just say that if our

218
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,080
nutrition is lacking the

219
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,879
the cannabinoid therapy will only be

220
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,439
able to do

221
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,478
so much because our body won't have the

222
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,079
capacity to properly use the cannabis

223
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,719
we're introducing

224
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,680
absolutely wow yeah all right please

225
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,039
continue

226
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,598
yeah well and that you know and so

227
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,639
that's you know you can carry that three

228
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,719
theme through a whole a whole the whole

229
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,319
range of things that i'm suggesting here

230
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,319
so i mean if we start off like i said

231
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,400
with optimizing the nutrition

232
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,400
you know and and again i mean you can

233
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,638
talk about things like fats and protein

234
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,638
status and amino acids and such

235
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,079
you know if we talk about micronutrients

236
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,519
you know i mean there's you know the

237
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,598
area that i do a lot of work with with

238
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,120
my patients is nutrigenomics

239
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,279
you know so we'll use like the the

240
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,918
23andme platforms one we tend to use the

241
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,918
most it's

242
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,120
it's you know some people have concerns

243
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,439
about that

244
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,959
um for a number of different reasons

245
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,160
mostly about where their health data and

246
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,079
things like that's going in but it

247
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,520
certainly is accessible and

248
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,038
and you know that's a whole other

249
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,878
conversation we could have but i mean

250
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,279
certainly within that you see

251
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,439
variability within patient populations

252
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,519
on you know again how they

253
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,360
build different parts of things that

254
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,399
intersect with the endocannabinoid

255
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,560
system and and

256
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,679
those are things that can be modulated

257
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,839
again macronutrient and micronutrients

258
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,038
so you know that's probably you know

259
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,439
again that's a fairly

260
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,878
deep dive into okay what's the diet that

261
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,319
you're looking at you know let's take a

262
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,039
look at some of the physical signs and

263
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,960
symptoms

264
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,240
you look at various different nutrient

265
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,079
deficiencies

266
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,399
you know and and that starts to become

267
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,800
part of the the conversation and basic

268
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,599
you know

269
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,079
history building you know that that's

270
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,839
you know

271
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,680
i do um next thing you know we take a

272
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
look at is hormones and hormones build

273
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,479
off of your nutritional status as well

274
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,839
too and and

275
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,639
again you know what we're talking

276
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,760
estrogen progesterone testosterone

277
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,759
you know we can move into some of the

278
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,080
neurotransmitter part of that as well

279
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,000
too

280
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,600
you know what they're talking dopamine

281
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,919
you know serotonin

282
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,440
you know epinephrine norepinephrine

283
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,439
cortisol levels

284
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
all of those have huge interplays you

285
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,560
know with regards to

286
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,399
you know effects on metabolism and blood

287
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,958
glucose and so again you know you need

288
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,519
to have

289
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,879
you know if your carbohydrate metabolism

290
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,679
blood sugars off

291
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,000
you know is that you know an impact on

292
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,958
cortisol or a response to altered

293
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,440
cortisol status and adrenal function and

294
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,278
so

295
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
again you know that's your dietary

296
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,080
habits start to build in on that as well

297
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,519
too and so

298
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,200
that starts to become the next part of

299
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
that you know we also take a look and if

300
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
we look at the the nutrigenomics part of

301
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,640
this

302
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,879
you know things like um you know

303
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,838
catechol like dopamine for example is a

304
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,320
catechol i mean

305
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,120
you know and it's you know it's impacted

306
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,760
by

307
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
a whole host of a network of of

308
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,759
different

309
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,080
um you know estrogen metabolism

310
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,399
cortisol epinephrine norepinephrine and

311
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,320
those build on again various different

312
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,399
micronutrients like b vitamins and

313
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
methylation status on neurotransmitter

314
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,958
production

315
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,560
so suddenly now you're seeing this

316
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,479
intersection here and then you know how

317
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,919
those hormones and neurotransmitters are

318
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,278
cleared out of the system

319
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,838
uh particularly through something called

320
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,639
catechol o methyltransferase which is an

321
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,720
enzyme that's the warrior versus the

322
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,319
warrior phenotype if anybody's

323
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,240
been following that aspect of it and

324
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
that has in my experience

325
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,759
has significant implications for

326
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,519
endocannabinoid tone

327
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,278
and response you know and and

328
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,078
furthermore it probably explains to a

329
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,159
large extent

330
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,919
what's going on you know with for

331
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,399
example the gender differences that we

332
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,479
see you know how women versus males

333
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,600
respond differently and largely that has

334
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,240
a significant

335
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,519
you know interplay with um you know

336
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,799
estrogen metabolism

337
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,078
and impacts on dopamine so you know that

338
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,439
starts to become something that's super

339
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,838
super interesting

340
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
so there's that element of it you know

341
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,480
the next

342
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,919
phase that i started taking a look at is

343
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,000
is the gastrointestinal tract

344
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,519
i do tons of work i mean it's it's one

345
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
of the areas that i work up outside of

346
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,519
cannabis

347
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,919
medicine with several other companies

348
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,320
with which is on microbiome

349
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,278
and um you know so that suddenly ties in

350
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,640
hugely with our

351
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,399
you know endocannabinoid there's some

352
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,319
really interesting research

353
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,000
that takes a look at the endocannabinoid

354
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,160
system as kind of the intersection

355
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,720
between the gut microbiome

356
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,000
you know and and the gut brain access

357
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,320
and the implications of that on

358
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,360
endocannabinoid system functioning are

359
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,879
fascinating as well too you know so

360
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,639
this becomes something that again when

361
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,559
you base it on our nutrition i mean the

362
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,078
types of fibers that we start to make

363
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,679
like for example

364
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,199
if we wanted to dig down into this a

365
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,199
little bit more and again we can

366
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,480
obviously we've got some some wine times

367
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,040
to talk about this so you'll probably

368
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,360
find a

369
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,719
skitter round over places but you know

370
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,200
let's take a look at something like

371
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,440
gaba you know the endocannabinoid system

372
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,879
you know the cb1 receptors are

373
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,040
you know i mean they have significant

374
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,559
impacts on gaba and glutamate

375
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,278
you know those are the excitatory

376
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,439
inhibitory neurotransmitters

377
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,519
and one of the interesting things is if

378
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,240
we take a look at the gut microbiome

379
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,360
you know butyrate is a short chain fatty

380
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,079
acid

381
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,480
anybody who's ever smelled rancid butter

382
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,120
you know

383
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,920
that's you know that's butter or that's

384
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,360
butyrate

385
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,039
and um but it's produced by um

386
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,560
you know the microbiome in the large

387
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,719
intestine right you know

388
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,559
the bacteroides species of bacteria that

389
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,240
colonize the large intestine

390
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,759
and it gets it by fermenting different

391
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,278
types of fibers particularly things like

392
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,838
psyllium powder

393
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,278
and um an old bran are two big sources

394
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,320
of it as well too there's several others

395
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,078
as well but that's what i use

396
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,440
predominantly

397
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,399
and butyrate is actually the building

398
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,519
block for

399
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,159
gaba all right gamma aminobutyric acid

400
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,759
so butyrate butyric so suddenly now

401
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,159
you're taking a look at one of the

402
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,439
major you know sort of regulatory

403
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,199
neurotransmitters within the

404
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
endocannabinoid system

405
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
you know the significant component of it

406
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,799
is being

407
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,719
generated in our gastrointestinal tract

408
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,838
by our microbiome and the type of fiber

409
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,440
that we eat

410
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,200
so suddenly that you know has huge

411
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,760
implications on this as well too so that

412
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,040
becomes a really significant element and

413
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,720
you know i do seminars for um

414
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,120
for continuing medical education for

415
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,278
patients on on gut ecology and

416
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,879
gut microbiome and how that works and

417
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,439
intersects with

418
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,958
immune function and t cell polarization

419
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,760
and this type of thing as well too so

420
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,278
there's some

421
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,480
some really interesting intersections

422
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,078
and again you know when we start talking

423
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,039
about endocannabinoids

424
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,519
you only start thinking about

425
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,919
anti-inflammatory effects

426
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,159
logic effects you know how much of that

427
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,399
is this intersection with gut microbiome

428
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,278
and

429
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,799
and t cell polarization through you know

430
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,039
mucus associated in

431
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,399
uh lymphoid tissue and this type of

432
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,919
thing

433
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,720
so that's that's that part of it um

434
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,399
my past work was in environmental

435
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,160
medicine i spent a i did a post

436
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,759
doctorate down at uh

437
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,078
in phoenix at the southwest college of

438
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,000
naturopathic medicine we created a

439
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,078
environmental medicine center center of

440
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,078
excellence uh dr walter kranian who you

441
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,159
guys actually probably up in the

442
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,838
washington state area would know him he

443
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,198
was quite highly regarded for

444
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,440
environmental medicine had a

445
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,278
very large clinic up there and so i had

446
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,120
the opportunity to spend a lot of time

447
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,320
and learn from him so you know we got to

448
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,679
spend

449
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,240
you know things like working with the

450
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,078
phoenix fire department and setting up a

451
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,839
wellness center and working at sort of

452
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,479
you know getting heavy metals out of

453
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,480
guys that went to hurricane katrina and

454
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,639
you know 911 and stuff and trying to get

455
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,079
rid of you know various different toxins

456
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,000
and the implications on that but that

457
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,919
part became part of these detoxification

458
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,039
pathways and certainly in that work i

459
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,559
mean that's probably where i ended up

460
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,958
getting a lot of my

461
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,319
my interest in in genomics because we're

462
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,159
taking a look at

463
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,000
genetic variation in cytochrome p450

464
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,600
enzymes which are the enzymes that clear

465
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,159
out a large you know the significant

466
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,360
amount of what we call xenobiotics or

467
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,519
you know chemicals within the

468
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,240
environment how those things get out of

469
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,679
our system is

470
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,039
run through the liver which is this big

471
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,759
filter you know and and so

472
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,039
that has implications on drug metabolism

473
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,399
and how that clears out

474
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,480
you know and again when we took a look

475
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,240
at environmental pollutants

476
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,480
you know things like solvent exposures

477
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,240
and pesticides and heavy metals

478
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,920
you know what we looked at is that had

479
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,839
you know three sort of areas that they

480
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,559
affected neurological

481
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,920
immune function and endocrine and so you

482
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,759
know suddenly when we start taking a

483
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,599
look at the impacts of

484
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,600
you know environmental compounds and

485
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,920
these xenobiotics

486
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,920
you know and how that starts to impact

487
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,479
you know hepatic function and clearance

488
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,159
and you know

489
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,759
you know how genetic polymorphisms and

490
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,838
variations

491
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,959
start to impact that then suddenly again

492
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,079
you know i mean suddenly there's all

493
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,078
sorts of you know

494
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,838
connections and intersections happening

495
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,439
with the endocannabinoid system

496
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,959
you know and certainly you know i mean

497
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,199
you know ethan you know

498
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,319
dr russo and i were just doing that work

499
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,958
on

500
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,879
you know the genetics of uh cannabis

501
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,479
hyperemesis syndrome

502
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,320
you know and and what we were seeing in

503
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,879
there was you know some genetic variants

504
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,320
on some of these drug clearance pathways

505
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,240
you know which again intersects with

506
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,480
pharmacogenomics and potentially

507
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,680
you know this environmental medicine

508
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,959
type thing you know and certainly you

509
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,159
know one of the things that i look at in

510
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,239
the work that i've done with some of the

511
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,679
license producers up here in canada

512
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,839
you know as we've really tried to

513
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,638
emphasize hey look pesticides are a

514
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,480
problem

515
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,000
you know but even especially with hemp

516
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,199
for example i mean one of the things i

517
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,720
think that gets

518
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,359
you know missed a little bit is that

519
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
hemp is a bio accumulator of cadmium

520
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
right

521
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:26,638
you know and so now you're going to have

522
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
to start taking a look and paying

523
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,680
attention and those those heavy metals

524
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,440
need to be looked at and

525
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,559
especially when we're doing concentrates

526
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
you know is that starting to be

527
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,879
something and cadmium's a fairly

528
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
nasty metal that has some significant

529
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,519
implications particularly on estrogen

530
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,679
metabolism

531
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,078
so there's your detoxification pathways

532
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:47,679
right on so so for those who are

533
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:50,399
are keeping score at home um i'm seeing

534
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,278
uh four variables so far that you've

535
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,240
delineated

536
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,879
that you talk to your patients about as

537
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,519
you are

538
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,439
moving towards your diagnosis and

539
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,399
figuring out cannabis protocols number

540
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,480
one being

541
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,199
what is the state of their nutrition

542
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,640
because they have to have the capacity

543
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,240
to be able to

544
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,360
um to intake the the cannabinoids

545
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,318
uh two uh was hormones um

546
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,198
three was the the con the status of

547
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,159
their gi

548
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,240
tract and four would be environmental

549
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,079
influences that might be acting on the

550
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,880
endocannabinoid system

551
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,480
um before we go into those any more

552
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
depth is there is there more on that

553
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,480
list

554
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,079
that's it all right so so i a couple

555
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,759
things that i want to focus on

556
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:39,519
which just um glowed in your answers

557
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,960
but i didn't want to interrupt you so so

558
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,000
the first thing is is

559
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,200
um you mentioned with you know

560
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,839
some amount of of coarseness to it

561
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,360
that there are gender differences um

562
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,798
when it comes to using

563
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,479
cannabis and um there is just not a lot

564
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,918
being talked about on that would you go

565
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,960
into that a little bit

566
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,960
oh sure yeah um

567
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,960
let's see where do we start on this one

568
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:12,240
well how about um um how do the health

569
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,599
how do the health benefits of using

570
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,519
cannabinoid medicine

571
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,678
differ between men and women and others

572
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,279
yeah i there's a couple different areas

573
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,640
that i would look at this and i

574
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,399
i guess what i was trying to think is

575
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,038
there's is how do we put this into a

576
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,559
logical framework that makes sense

577
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,798
so i think where i'd probably start with

578
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:34,079
this

579
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:35,519
we we see different responses uh like

580
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,839
women in general have different

581
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,879
responses to dopamine and that's

582
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,079
that's a large factor because dopamine

583
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,600
and estrogen get

584
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:48,079
cleared out through this this calm tea

585
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,639
enzyme right and and so what tends to

586
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,159
happen is

587
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,240
is that the system can be overloaded

588
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,320
um you know it becomes you know has to

589
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,519
clear out i usually use the analogy of

590
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,839
we've got a

591
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,599
kitchen sink and what's what's the size

592
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,439
of the drain in the kitchen sink and

593
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,719
within that sink we're pouring in these

594
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
various different hormones and

595
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,640
neurotransmitters

596
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,319
and so obviously for women as estrogen

597
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,880
levels you know start to

598
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,038
to rise you know you're going to have a

599
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,039
more significant capacity

600
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,640
consumed by the clearance of those you

601
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,160
know that particular hormone

602
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,480
and so what are the implications on that

603
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,558
for other neurotransmitters and things

604
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,679
like dopamine for example

605
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:29,678
so that's i think that that by you know

606
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
it has some significant implications on

607
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,000
you know how women respond to it you

608
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
know

609
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,558
how they utilize it and dosing

610
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,159
strategies and that and it's it's not

611
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,759
i mean i couldn't say definitively i'd

612
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,519
have to spend time with each particular

613
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,759
patient to kind of identify

614
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,440
you know what's going on so for example

615
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,879
you know some women

616
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,200
um either through nutritional

617
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,559
deficiencies or genetic variants don't

618
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,160
clear out estrogen

619
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,558
as well you know they either have a

620
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,720
smaller drain or what have you and so

621
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,000
that has implications on mood which you

622
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,240
know i mean i don't think i'm speaking

623
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,839
out of turn here but anybody who's

624
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,359
in a relationship will have noticed that

625
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,158
sometimes you know moods

626
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,359
change a little bit throughout cycles

627
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,600
and

628
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,119
again that has a lot in my experience to

629
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,038
do with again you know how these

630
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,798
estrogen metabolites

631
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,440
are either accumulating because there's

632
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,359
multiple different you know

633
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,519
metabolites of estrogen based on the the

634
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:25,359
molecular structure what we call

635
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,480
two hydroxy four hydroxy and 16 hydroxy

636
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,319
alpha

637
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,640
estrogens and each one has a slightly

638
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,798
different effect and pathway

639
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,000
and so as those are kind of consuming up

640
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,679
different capacity of

641
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,079
calm tea then that starts to shift

642
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,919
around you know the the dopamine

643
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,319
metabolism and can lead to you know

644
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,640
again

645
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:47,519
mood anxiety you know headaches you know

646
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,480
pain cramping and this type of thing so

647
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,639
so i think that that's

648
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,599
you know just just from a standpoint of

649
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,360
of how you deal

650
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,038
you know with women's health and

651
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,719
gynecological health

652
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,480
you know that's you know those estrogen

653
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,759
metabolites in that pathway so when we

654
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,599
start taking a look at the

655
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,440
endocannabinoid system well

656
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,158
we see intersection there through you

657
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,320
know serotonin pathways and dopamine

658
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,159
pathways in particular

659
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,158
and then furthermore you know things

660
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,640
like you know the menstrual cycle is

661
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,400
regulated through prostaglandins and

662
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,480
prostaglandins are again you know

663
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,120
built out of the types of fats that we

664
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,200
have are omega-3 six and nine saturated

665
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,839
fats arachidonic acid and this type of

666
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,840
thing

667
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,079
and those prostaglandins have a singing

668
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,240
a significant impact on the lining of

669
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,480
the uterus of the endometrium

670
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,480
and again so you know they help you know

671
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,919
shut off and open the small blood

672
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,159
blood vessels that are involved in

673
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,759
menses and so

674
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,520
you know again one of the things that we

675
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,440
work a lot with women is taking a look

676
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,158
at your essential fatty acid status and

677
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,480
so

678
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,640
you know i think the logical extension

679
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,240
of that is well let's take a look at

680
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
what happens with the endocannabinoid

681
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,519
system and certainly you know we see

682
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,400
that you know

683
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,879
you know various different

684
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,720
endocannabinoids like pea and

685
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,440
and this type of thing have an impact on

686
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,360
on uterine proliferation endometriosis

687
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,440
ovarian cysts and such

688
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,959
so so i think that's you know probably

689
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,038
uh

690
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,279
yeah yeah that's a good snapshot and you

691
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,640
know listening to you describe this

692
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,798
you know on on one hand um the detail in

693
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,200
your answer is remarkable because

694
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,319
i swear i talk to cannabis researchers

695
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,480
all the time

696
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,439
and i do not get this level of detailed

697
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,759
answer

698
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,519
from most anybody which you know is

699
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,000
impressive but then also at the same

700
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:35,440
time as somebody who works with patients

701
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,480
you know daily um it also

702
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,759
is kind of frustrating because i'm like

703
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,079
oh my god

704
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:46,079
you know this is the more the more

705
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:49,678
sentences you say chris the more complex

706
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:52,158
the the diagnosis seems to become

707
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,120
about what cannabinoids we're going to

708
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,080
use

709
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,479
to offer relief and strengthening to

710
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,678
which

711
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,000
part of the human so they can even use

712
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,240
the other cannabinoids

713
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,038
with the ailment that we're actually

714
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,558
targeting

715
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,400
it's like there's so many there's so

716
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,839
many layers and it makes sense right i

717
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,720
mean so many people

718
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,399
pooh-pooh the idea of how much good

719
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,360
cannabis does you're like oh people

720
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
think it solves

721
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,798
everything well it's like you know right

722
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
it doesn't solve everything

723
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,038
it solves one thing the endocannabinoid

724
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,240
system and the thing is is that's

725
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,319
the body's um thermostat and so

726
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,480
it touches all of the mission critical

727
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,960
systems in the body so yeah

728
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,519
cannabis does really well with this one

729
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,000
system but it's the master regulator so

730
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,639
in a way

731
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,919
yeah it actually does help everything

732
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,720
and while that makes it

733
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:48,320
such a beneficial herb at the same time

734
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,720
as a caregiver who's listening to this

735
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,918
show

736
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,200
i can imagine it can feel kind of

737
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,360
i don't know defeating in a way where

738
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
who's got the amount of information

739
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,119
about their about their patient

740
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,038
and the time to talk with them about all

741
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,000
this and and we're going to talk more in

742
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,119
the second set

743
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,359
about the analytics you use but but just

744
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,918
speaking to the bigger idea of

745
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,038
the complexity of this really suggests

746
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,960
to me that we have

747
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,038
just scratched the surface of

748
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,798
endocannabinoid medicine

749
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,798
yeah and i i i think this is the

750
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,639
i mean this speaks to such a larger

751
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,278
issue you know which is

752
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,320
is what is health care and what is

753
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,000
disease care

754
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,000
right you know and and like i said i

755
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,880
mean i'm integrative you know i mean a

756
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,359
lot of my

757
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,080
my naturopathic doctor friends streak

758
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,000
and [ __ ]

759
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,278
you know when i prescribe stuff and and

760
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,200
things like that

761
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,960
a lot of my medical doctor friends

762
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,000
shriek and horror when i start talking

763
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,319
about you know

764
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,880
holistic approaches and things like that

765
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,720
um so i i look at myself as a bridge

766
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,320
you know i try very much to be very

767
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,000
grounded in science

768
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,639
you know um but i also recognize that

769
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,119
you know i mean

770
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,759
there's a role you have to use the right

771
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,359
tool

772
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,960
you know you have to but you have to

773
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,839
also have enough information in our

774
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,440
healthcare system at this time

775
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,038
you know struggles and especially up

776
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
here in canada i've talked with many

777
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,599
many of my

778
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,880
medical doctor friends you know and we

779
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,558
have you know we have medicine where

780
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,919
doctors are you know paid by the

781
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:16,399
government and things like that but you

782
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,919
know

783
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,080
to a large extent and again i practice

784
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,960
in the u.s you know medicine

785
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,960
is is determined you know on this sort

786
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,558
of fee-for-service model right which

787
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,159
means that okay well if you see more

788
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,038
patients you make more revenue out of

789
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,120
this

790
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,879
and so you know and and the efforts

791
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,798
around evidence-based medicine and to do

792
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,799
these things are to try and create a

793
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,440
a structured framework to do that which

794
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,119
is again it's really helpful when

795
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,400
you know you're in an emergency room and

796
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,678
you're crashing and you're having a

797
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,440
heart attack or

798
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,880
you've been in a motor vehicle accident

799
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,240
or you've crashed or something like that

800
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,120
as well too i mean these are things

801
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,278
where

802
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,479
you know are super important to have

803
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,480
these things that can be acted on

804
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,360
quickly and rapidly and be very very

805
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,200
effective

806
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,599
but the model starts to break down as we

807
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,519
get more and more into these individual

808
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,839
you know into individual care and and i

809
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,000
think you know what i i

810
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,959
struggle with and what i i try and you

811
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,960
know my one

812
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,640
small voice in the wilderness here is to

813
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,720
say like hey everybody

814
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,200
it can't just be about cannabis it

815
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,120
actually needs to be about the patient

816
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,038
and and like i said cannabis is an

817
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,639
incredible tool it's it's very helpline

818
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,839
and as we you know we've talked in our

819
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,919
previous conversations

820
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,079
is that you know i kind of come from

821
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,799
that as saying like you know

822
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,480
cannabis is remarkably easy to to do

823
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,240
something with because it actually works

824
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,919
you can see it happening i mean

825
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,359
try dealing with you know the sort of

826
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,120
poking and prodding of some of the other

827
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,439
herbal medicines

828
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,399
and and so that becomes you know uh it's

829
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,600
more difficult it's

830
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,200
more nuanced on this as well too so

831
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,719
you know but what i struggle with here a

832
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,558
little bit is that i see

833
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,558
cannabis kind of being moved into sort

834
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,000
of like well thc and cbd

835
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:53,359
what's the dose what's the prescribing

836
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,640
and all there is that we move into what

837
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,079
i call sort of you know and i'm not the

838
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,038
only one i certainly didn't coin this

839
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,960
term but

840
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,400
green allopathy which is well let's just

841
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,120
find a green alternative for the

842
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,840
medication

843
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,759
so we'll use willow bark or curcumin for

844
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,079
aspirin there's an anti-inflammatory or

845
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,879
will

846
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,079
you choose whatever one sort of goes

847
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,520
there and again you know i think you

848
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,359
know trying to bring this

849
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,798
patient-centered focus back into it and

850
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,639
i think that's you know that's what sort

851
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,398
of drew me to

852
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,000
the you know endocannabinoids and

853
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,199
cannabis system was we started

854
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,240
to see patients responding quickly

855
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,600
and and you know being able to work

856
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
fairly

857
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,278
on their own to be able to sort of

858
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,840
manage their own health care through

859
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,398
accessing cannabis and now it's sort of

860
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,000
like you know

861
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,199
my job that i kind of look at is well

862
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,919
let's bring in some of these other stuff

863
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,038
that's been

864
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,600
you know i mean you know what i'm

865
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,599
talking about here isn't new within sort

866
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,798
of the integrative medicine naturopathic

867
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,398
community it's just nobody's ever

868
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:47,599
overrelated on the endocannabinoid

869
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,398
system

870
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,000
in this particular way and and so you

871
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,519
know it's just like i said my role as a

872
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,558
bridge is to try and sort of bring that

873
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,000
up but again you know i mean for

874
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,678
patients that have itself i think most

875
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,919
people have a good sense of

876
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,120
you know how do i optimize nutrition i

877
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,080
think if we sat down and said okay

878
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,158
what's a healthy diet

879
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,398
look like you know most people could

880
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,440
tell us and so i would say like well

881
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:11,678
just recognize how important that is and

882
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,600
not and not only just in using that in

883
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,759
cannabis but again also trying to make

884
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,278
your cannabis work better for you

885
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,519
you know and and you know again are we

886
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,200
do we as as clinicians and people do we

887
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,038
want to keep someone on a medication

888
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,278
forever whether it be cannabis

889
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,038
or a pharmaceutical or a herbal medicine

890
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,720
or do we want to try and build

891
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,960
the capacity where patients can take

892
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,960
control of their health

893
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,558
things okay i'm out there exercising i'm

894
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,319
getting blood pumping i'm

895
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,158
you know doing my exercise routine i'm

896
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,439
eating healthy i've got my diet cleared

897
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,960
up as well too

898
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,558
and does that start to say i use my

899
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,000
cannabis to kind of help me get to a

900
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,639
certain space and now i can use

901
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,798
it either less frequently or at certain

902
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,038
situations because i have the resiliency

903
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:54,398
because i built on these other aspects

904
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,960
so so another thing that you mentioned

905
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:57,359
that i

906
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,200
found very engaging is this phrase that

907
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,959
i'm going to start using all the time

908
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,519
of medicine by average and

909
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,679
you know i know that there are doctors

910
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,879
and caregivers who are listening who run

911
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,519
into this every day

912
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,760
because you know first off just because

913
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,240
we work with cannabis

914
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,440
at least up until normalization has

915
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,919
begun

916
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,919
the vast majority of patients that we

917
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,720
come in contact with

918
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,000
they are already not the average they

919
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,079
are the fringe because

920
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,319
by the time that people get to cannabis

921
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,000
medicine they've usually already tried

922
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,158
everything else right

923
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,319
the idea of like you know everybody's

924
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,840
parents and grandparents now using you

925
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,918
know topicals and

926
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,759
and you know edibles for their aches and

927
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,000
pains this is really something that has

928
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,720
just come into acceptance again

929
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,798
you know more recently as there are more

930
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,798
recreational stores around but

931
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,480
but you know in the in the transition

932
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,000
years that we're in and certainly in the

933
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,319
heritage market

934
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,319
by the time people got to cannabis

935
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,038
western medicine had already given up on

936
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,240
them

937
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,798
and so so by its very you know

938
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,720
nature of the prohibition years everyone

939
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,558
we got was generally

940
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,319
not average they were on the fringe

941
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,119
because regular medicine didn't work for

942
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,720
them

943
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,398
so then we've got that set of patients

944
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,679
but then also we've got all these new

945
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,359
patients which

946
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,399
uh you know since since cannabis

947
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:22,079
medicine can help just about everybody

948
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,398
um you know there's there's all these

949
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,599
people who are served by western

950
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,798
medicine who are now

951
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,759
also being served by cannabinopathic

952
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,038
care

953
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:36,079
and um i find it both

954
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:39,440
you know informative and troubling

955
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:42,558
that the medicine by

956
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,919
average really is to the advantage

957
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:49,359
of the the

958
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,559
health industry and the and the

959
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,479
patient care industry and not the

960
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,639
the health care industry is you made

961
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,880
that delineation earlier about

962
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,038
about medicine for health versus

963
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,559
medicine to keep you alive to sell you

964
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:06,240
more medicine right

965
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:08,798
and um this idea of medicine by average

966
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,159
is so frustrating to so many caregivers

967
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,918
i'm not expecting you to have an

968
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,880
answer for it because it's it's it's a

969
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,960
it's a difficult paradoxical thing

970
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,880
but but what kind of advice would you

971
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,440
give to caregivers

972
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,360
who are dealing with this trying to

973
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,360
provide

974
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,678
individualized medicine in a system that

975
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,038
does

976
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,038
medicine by average

977
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,679
yeah i mean and again you know i'm so

978
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,679
steeped in it i had

979
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,120
you know again i had this conversation

980
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,278
with a patient the other day and

981
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,879
and they're like oh my god this is so

982
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,798
frustrating and it's like

983
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,799
well this is just the ocean that we kind

984
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,079
of swim in as naturopathic physicians

985
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,119
it's something that you know

986
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:52,558
is why people come and seek us out um

987
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,239
i i think that this is the amazing about

988
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,918
you know podcasts like this in the world

989
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,038
that we live in now is that people

990
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,080
are starting to you know learn more and

991
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,398
i mean just just

992
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,079
like i think about my own experience and

993
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,759
figuring out cannabis and

994
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,759
you know the the people that i've worked

995
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,398
with and just the giants that i've

996
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,158
i've had the opportunity to to learn

997
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,038
from right you know but my

998
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,320
my own learning was accelerated that way

999
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:17,200
but i think at the end of the day you

1000
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,678
know being

1001
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,200
you know your own advocate um and

1002
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,080
starting to sort of say like hey wait a

1003
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,319
second

1004
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,519
you know i have some questions about

1005
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,720
this and about that

1006
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,558
you know that that's that's key i mean

1007
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,278
that's the most important part of it you

1008
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:32,720
know and

1009
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,119
i think the hardest part is yeah how do

1010
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,159
you find a clinician that works

1011
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,918
you know that's saying like well that's

1012
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,278
really interesting and i don't i

1013
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,640
certainly can't answer you i mean i'm

1014
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,720
always surprised that

1015
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,919
some of the doctors that are super open

1016
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,759
to this and

1017
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,200
some of that aren't you know i mean i

1018
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,960
just had a super interesting

1019
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,720
conversation with a rheumatologist down

1020
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,558
there your way in seattle

1021
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,960
uh doing really cool stuff with a heart

1022
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,079
rate variability and and autoimmune

1023
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200
illnesses and

1024
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,720
we were coming at this from two

1025
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,880
different ways but the intersection was

1026
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,600
remarkable and i'm like okay

1027
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,120
i've met some rheumatologists and can be

1028
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:06,798
pretty conservative right you know and

1029
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,038
so suddenly you know to have them

1030
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,000
move outside of this is really exciting

1031
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:11,839
so i

1032
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,599
you know again i i couldn't tell you how

1033
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,319
but i think certainly i think

1034
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,918
i think most doctors are seeking you

1035
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:22,158
know that relationship i think the

1036
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:25,278
the um the epidemic of physician

1037
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,120
burnout that we have has a lot to do

1038
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,519
with the loss of sort of the

1039
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:33,918
doctor-patient relationship

1040
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,919
you know doctors are seeing that as much

1041
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,278
as anyone else and so you know i mean

1042
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,399
you you have to you're gonna have to

1043
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:40,159
sort through a bunch of different

1044
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:40,719
physicians perhaps until you find one

1045
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,880
that

1046
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,720
that has that and and i but i do

1047
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,600
sympathize with a lot of those doctors

1048
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,278
and certainly

1049
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,798
you know the ones that i know socially

1050
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,079
versus i know professionally sometimes

1051
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,038
there's a bit of a

1052
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,480
uh incongruity between the people i know

1053
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:55,599
them to be and how they're working in

1054
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,120
their space and

1055
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,359
they're all humans and so i try and

1056
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,759
approach that with some compassion and

1057
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,719
and and and sympathy of how they're

1058
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,119
doing and

1059
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,079
and go from there so again i don't i

1060
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,518
don't know if i necessarily have an

1061
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,358
answer on them say to be the advocate

1062
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,838
you understand your patient your doctor

1063
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:11,519
is

1064
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,679
is probably struggling in a lot of

1065
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,280
different ways around that and

1066
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,878
and reach out and try and engage in

1067
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,560
conversation and you'll find some that

1068
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,398
do and some that don't which is

1069
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,918
you know maybe horribly naive but that's

1070
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:22,799
what i'll put out there right on thank

1071
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,199
you chris

1072
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,560
so um we're going to take a short break

1073
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,799

after the break

1076
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,000
we are going to be talking about some of

1077
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,480
the analytics

1078
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,358
that are available to take a good

1079
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,240
snapshot of your body or your patient's

1080

body

1082
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,918
needle of individualized cannabis

chris spooner

1087
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,199
as cannabis regulations become more

1088
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,519
demanding and consumers become more

1089
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,279
educated it is increasingly important to

1090
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,119
avoid the use of chemical pesticides

1091
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,800
when cultivating cannabis

1092
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,640
beneficial insects have been used for

1093
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,240
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and

1094
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,559
ornamental plant industry

1095
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,239
and today many cannabis cultivators are

1096
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,279

00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,078
supplied by the event

1180
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,639
but there will be easy public talking

1181
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,760
which is why this is a strictly over 21

1182
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,480
event

1183
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,000
you can camp rent a cabin or stay at a

1184
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,240
local airbnb

1185
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,119
glamping and rv packages are available

1186
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,959
too

1187
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,559
i'm happy to say that shaping fire is a

1188
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,280
sponsor of the event and i'll be there

1189
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,799
too

1190
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,880
i look forward to connecting with other

1191
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,680
autoflower fans like me

1192
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,920
so get all the details at the autoflower

1193
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,000
cup

1194
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:25,200
2021.com and follow the instagram at

1195
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,358
the autoflower cup 2021 and i'll see you

1196
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,838
in august at autoflower cup when we

1197
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:32,078
bring the autoflower family together to

1198
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:33,759
celebrate

1199
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,119
while i love growing under the sun

1200
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,119
there's a lot of good reasons to grow

1201
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,800
indoors and if you're like most folks

1202
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,559
you want a lighting source that grows

1203
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,280
high yielding healthy plants without

1204
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,279
using excessive amounts of electricity

1205
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,400
bios lighting creates biological

1206
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,079
lighting solutions

1207
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,559
that brings the natural brilliance of

1208
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,640
the outdoors into your grow room

1209
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,320
bios lighting has the attributes that i

1210
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,279
look for in a horticultural lighting

1211
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,119
solution

1212
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,720
i've bought those cheap lights online

1213
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,559
and they're difficult to work with and

1214
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:04,559
fail in no time in contrast my bios led

1215
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:05,119
light is industrial grade to last a long

1216
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,320
time

1217
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,838
it is ip66 wet rated so little foliar

1218
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,680
overspray won't harm it

1219
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,679
it is easy to clean without taking it

1220
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:14,319
down and of course the most important

1221
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:16,559
aspect

1222
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,640
it is built for the exact light spectrum

1223
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,920
i want for great yielding healthy

1224
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,279
cannabis plants

1225
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,519
and it doesn't hurt that their lighting

1226
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,760
rigs look badass too

1227
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,358
many horticultural led lighting systems

1228
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,359
are based on irrelevant performance

1229
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:30,639
metrics and people love to argue online

1230
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,559
about these numbers

1231
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,879
i prefer to judge on par photon

1232
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,639
efficiency and how happy my plants are

1233
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,960
and the bios lights exceed my

1234
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,279
expectations in these categories

1235
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,000
bios lights have an optimized broad

1236
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,079
spectrum that

1237
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,559
maximizes photosynthesis and plant

1238
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,359
growth while also providing the ideal

1239
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,519
conditions

1240
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,519
for superior par efficacy and a

1241
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,960
comfortable visual experience

1242
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:55,599
i also love their attentive and

1243
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,838
over-educated customer service folks

1244
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,760
bios starts with a team of biologists

1245
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:00,559
before getting the electrical engineers

1246
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,320
involved

1247
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,559
they have studied how light impacts

1248
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,240
cannabis plants and devised an overall

1249
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,519
strategy that works

1250
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,399
i encourage you to check out their

welcome back you are listening to

1260
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,280
shaping fire i'm your host

1261
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,880
shangolos and our guest this week is

1262
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,680
naturopathic physician

1263
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,160
chris spooner so during the first set we

1264
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,358
focused on the different variables that

1265
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,399
can significantly

1266
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:47,279
impact the patient's use of

1267
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:50,318
cannabinoids and during the second set

1268
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,280
we're going to try to figure out how we

1269
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:55,279
suss out which of these variables we

1270
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,319
need to be able to

1271
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,720
pay the most attention to when either

1272
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,358
doing

1273
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,358
a self-assessment as a patient who is

1274
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:06,318
trying to self-heal

1275
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,598
or as a doctor or caregiver who is

1276
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:09,440
working with a patient

1277
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,480
and you want to give them the best

1278
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,039
individualized medicine as possible

1279
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,199
so so chris i guess take us from the top

1280
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,880
you know you you've got a new patient

1281
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,358
and you've got their you know

1282
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,000
questionnaire in front of you

1283
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,838
and and and you know from our our prior

1284
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,400
talks i know that there is

1285
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,000
um you know i'll call it a battery of

1286
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,680
tests i don't know if it's that many but

1287
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,960
there are some tests that

1288
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:37,358
you rely on um

1289
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,039
to give you your basic information and

1290
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:39,838
you know we've all had blood tests so

1291
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,279
why don't we start

1292
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,440
there's something that people have got a

1293
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,359
frame of reference with and then

1294
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,960
and then continue on through the other

1295
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,838
analytics that that you

1296
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,480
give your patients yeah sure yeah and it

1297
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,480
again you know it's

1298
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:57,598
this is gonna fluctuate a little bit you

1299
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,440
know so i mean you know i'll give that

1300
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,318
caveat before we get started here and

1301
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,880
certainly if

1302
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,559
you know i may segue into one or two of

1303
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,760
those if we need to but

1304
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,440
but yeah i mean i think you know we're

1305
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,960
starting off i mean you

1306
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,639
there's a number of things to factor

1307
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,318
here you know so first of all you know

1308
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,440
what type of testing does a

1309
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,880
clinician or a patient have access to

1310
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,559
you know i think probably what i try and

1311
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,200
do is start off with the very basics you

1312
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,599
know basic blood work blood chemistry

1313
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,799
uh you know cbc like compete complete

1314
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,800
blood counts

1315
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,000
you know liver function tests you know

1316
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,519
thyroid these these sort of

1317
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,760
standard things that you can get from

1318
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,159
any of your your medical doctors

1319
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,040
you know or naturopathic physicians or

1320
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,719
or you know

1321
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,318
these are pretty straightforward so i

1322
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,318
mean that's that's a nice easy one to do

1323
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:42,880
it's it's relatively inexpensive it's

1324
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,920
you know so

1325
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,440
i think this is a good place to start um

1326
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,280
generally what i do is i kind of break

1327
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,720
this down and if we starting with the

1328
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,640
the model or the framework that i

1329
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,279
suggested about you know taking a look

1330
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,000
at sort of

1331
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,280
optimizing nutrition here a little bit

1332
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,639
you know there's a couple of markers

1333
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,240
that you can take a look at

1334
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,000
within a basic blood work that can give

1335
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,000
you a general sense of things so for

1336
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,679
example you know we could start off with

1337
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,519
is someone anemic or not you know so a

1338
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,000
lot of patients may come in with fatigue

1339
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,000
and

1340
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,199
you know exhaustion and you know and and

1341
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,039
fatigue is a pretty you know it's a

1342
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,559
pretty broad-based indicator but you

1343
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,239
know i mean we can sort of see is like

1344
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,799
you know what your iron status looking

1345
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:18,078
like

1346
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,200
you know because i mean sometimes you

1347
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,640
just need to make sure that you're

1348
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,639
checking off some of the basics because

1349
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,799
sometimes there's a tendency to

1350
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,960
you know to rush off into more exotic

1351
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,119
you know the the analysis is you know

1352
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,159
when we hear hooves think of horses not

1353
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,318
zebras

1354
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,000
right you know and then the qualifiers

1355
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,279
unless you're in africa but

1356
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,280
you know so there's some contextual

1357
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,800
component to that as well too

1358
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,319
you know so so certainly just taking a

1359
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,920
look at you know what your your

1360
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,519
red blood cell counts hematocrit

1361
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,280
hemoglobin is

1362
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,880
um and just making sure you're not

1363
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,079
running anemic but within that you know

1364
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,519
one of the ones that i like to pay

1365
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,000
attention to is a

1366
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:56,079
fairly it's a decent indicator of things

1367
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,480
like vitamin b12 and folic acid status

1368
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,480
is is what's called the mcv it's the

1369
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,599
mean corpuscular volume so this is

1370
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,760
basically

1371
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,960
you know the the size of your red blood

1372
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,599
cells

1373
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,440
you know and and usually i mean the old

1374
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,079
term for it was a pernicious anemia

1375
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,838
which

1376
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,280
you know then we'd give people b12 shots

1377
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:13,920
to try and bring it around a little bit

1378
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,680
if this

1379
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,440
mcv was a little bit elevated um

1380
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,118
up here in canada i think we're using

1381
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,000
the same unit some of these will vary a

1382
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,680
little bit but usually it's above 97.

1383
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,760
i forget what the number is you just you

1384
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,598
forget the the units um

1385
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,720
but uh you know that usually suggests

1386
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,920
that these blood cells are a little bit

1387
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:33,679
bigger and and

1388
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,519
the reason that this one's important

1389
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:39,039
from an endocannabinoid status is

1390
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:41,280
if we go back to this sort of you know

1391
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,239
calm tea pathway that i was you know

1392
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,480
sort of

1393
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,519
speaking to a little bit earlier you

1394
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,000
know the b

1395
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,039
vitamins particularly you know folic

1396
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,039
acid b12

1397
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,199
b6 and that are involved in this thing

1398
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:56,239
called a methylation pathway

1399
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:58,399
and and this methylation pathway is one

1400
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:01,199
of these things that creates

1401
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,599
a compound that that you know supports

1402
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,399
uh

1403
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,960
com t uh s adenosine methionine in

1404
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,800
particular is the one it is but

1405
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,400
um but those your b your folic acid and

1406
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,920
your b12 have to be

1407
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,240
you have this little methyl group it's a

1408
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,480
little carbon with three hydrogens onto

1409
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:18,239
it

1410
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,240
added to it so you get these methylated

1411
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:20,959
b vitamins and you know for for people

1412
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:22,639
that are

1413
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,000
in the know about nutritional

1414
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,159
supplementation we

1415
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,318
most people tend to use methylated forms

1416
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,480
of folic acid and b12

1417
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,519
uh because they're active and we know

1418
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,679
that these genetic

1419
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,920
variants aren't there but certainly if

1420
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:37,519
we see the mcv starting to be up there a

1421
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,639
little bit it starts to become something

1422
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,318
like well maybe we need to take a look

1423
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,358
at the b12 status

1424
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:45,039
or or take a look at um

1425
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,039
you know uh supplementing someone with

1426
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,719
that you know the other part of this is

1427
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,920
that pernicious anemia often had

1428
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:50,879
something to do with gastric

1429
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,960
inflammation

1430
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,720
b12s absorbed there's a cofactor for it

1431
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,480
in the lining of the gut that helps get

1432
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,239
it absorbed so if there's irritation to

1433
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,000
the lining of the stomach you know

1434
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,000
certainly that can compromise absorption

1435
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,920
as well too so things like acid blocker

1436
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,800
medications and that can have impacts on

1437
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,800
that

1438
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,560
so so that's the one of the you know a

1439
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,400
nice place to start it's nice and easy

1440
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,599
so if you're seeing that mcd being a

1441
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,200
little bit elevated well

1442
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,880
maybe we need to take a look at that

1443
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,159
sort of the absorption of b12 and its

1444
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,519
various parameters of that

1445
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,039
as we start working down a little bit

1446
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,559
more a couple of the other markers that

1447
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,719
i start to take a look in there

1448
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:29,358
um you know i take two i like to take a

1449
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:32,480
look at the white blood cell counts

1450
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,279
um and this speaks to a larger element

1451
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,960
that's that's

1452
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,720
um we need to have a quick

1453
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,480
conversation about which is about what

1454
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:41,759
are reference ranges

1455
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,599
because this very much speaks to our

1456
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,560
last thing of you know medicine by

1457
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,920
average

1458
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,239
you know so i think people need to

1459
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,559
understand that reference ranges so when

1460
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,559
you

1461
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:53,039
when you get a lab test it gives you the

1462
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:56,480
number like for example

1463
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:58,239
tv is uh 91

1464
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,480
and with it you're given a reference

1465
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:04,000
range that is 88 through

1466
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,280
97 right and and you look at that and

1467
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,760
you're like oh well that must mean that

1468
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,000
i'm

1469
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,119
healthy within the space well you could

1470
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,039
be or you couldn't but you need to

1471
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,599
understand that that reference range

1472
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,279
refers to a population norm so basically

1473
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,920
what you're looking at is sort of a

1474
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,280
you know kind of a 95 percent of the

1475
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,240
tests fall within

1476
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,160
value a and value b of which there's an

1477
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,519
upper and lower range right and so

1478
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,519
that really speaks to this sort of

1479
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,639
medicine by average and i've always sort

1480
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:29,440
of been like well if you're one of these

1481
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,598
people

1482
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,559
that tends to be up at the upper end of

1483
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,960
a value

1484
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,800
you know and you drop 10 points you know

1485
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,720
do you feel as bad as a person who's at

1486
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,599
the lower end of the value and drops 10

1487
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:42,239
points

1488
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,519
you know and uh you know but one of

1489
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:45,358
those falls within the

1490
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:47,199
the reference range and one of them

1491
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:48,799
doesn't and so that's where this

1492
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,399
individualized medicine goes where you

1493
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,839
need to kind of start to ask some

1494
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,000
you know patients some questions about

1495
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,838
this and and thyroid testing is

1496
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,199
notorious for this right you know you

1497
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:59,039
can see some patients

1498
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,480
you know they just have a range that

1499
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,558
they feel much better and that

1500
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,639
sometimes is inside the reference range

1501
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,319
and sometimes outside of that

1502
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:07,679
you know hold on before you continue on

1503
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,599
another thing that you just said about

1504
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,239
the reference range that just surprised

1505
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,559
me

1506
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,519
um unless i misunderstood you said that

1507
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,880
the reference

1508
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,440
range comes from the averages of the

1509
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,119
tests

1510
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,960
that are um taking place well that means

1511
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,079
that if a population is getting

1512
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,119
increasingly

1513
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:29,280
unhealthy that the reference

1514
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,200
range will change as well say for

1515
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,200
example in my country you know

1516
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:38,239
obesity is a scourge here and so

1517
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:42,000
the our reference ranges that are

1518
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:45,039
attached to obesity would be

1519
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,159
theoretically moving in the wrong

1520
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,480
directions

1521
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:50,318
but then also since it's happening to so

1522
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,920
many people our reference range is

1523
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:55,039
actually drifting with

1524
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,079
the population's lack of health yeah

1525
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,838
potentially you know and

1526
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,519
i think you know and for some of these

1527
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,279
tests you know there's a long history of

1528
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,079
what we know like you know blood lipids

1529
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,240
and things like

1530
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,760
that you know that it's like okay well

1531
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:07,039
we know that these issues

1532
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,480
you know i mean there's a fairly long

1533
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:09,440
history of what this looks like so i

1534
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,519
think they're a little bit more

1535
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,800
resistant to that trending

1536
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:16,960
in that respect um so as i

1537
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,960
so yeah i don't disagree with you and i

1538
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,559
think for

1539
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,318
like for example again let's go back to

1540
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,079
thyroid a little bit you know because

1541
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,599
again there's a lot of interpretation on

1542
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,720
that there's other factors that start to

1543
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,280
come into this you know

1544
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:30,078
the thyroid the it's interesting up here

1545
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,000
in canada

1546
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:36,000
you know the the depending on the lab

1547
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,719
the upper limit limit of that is is 5.5

1548
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,920
and i believe that if you cross the

1549
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,078
border down and

1550
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,960
into washington state there i believe

1551
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,880
the american

1552
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,119
college for endocrinology has kind of

1553
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,559
said it is like under 2.5 so there's a

1554
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,838
significant difference on where you're

1555
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,200
classified

1556
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:55,199
as you know hypothyroid or thyroid and

1557
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,358
it may not necessarily be the test so

1558
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,118
much as what the impact is on your

1559
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,279
clinician's mindset

1560
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,640
as to whether this is an issue or not so

1561
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,240
someone that's looking at a reference

1562
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,159
range of up to five

1563
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:08,959
you know i would say like whoa okay your

1564
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,239
thyroid your tsh level sitting at 4.5

1565
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,400
that's a problem

1566
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,078
whereas a physician may not you know

1567
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,440
who's used to seeing it at five whereas

1568
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,440
someone who's trained

1569
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,720
you know or in a different jurisdiction

1570
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,838
where it's slightly different may look

1571
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:20,399
at that and be like oh yeah i know i

1572
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:21,838
agree

1573
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,720
you know that you know you need to be

1574
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,078
under 2.5 so i think you've got two

1575
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,439
things there one is certainly the issue

1576
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,680
that you're speaking to but the other

1577
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,679
one is also the clinician's mindset

1578
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:33,199
and how they start to prioritize what to

1579
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,558
look like which i think it's probably a

1580
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,078
little bit more

1581
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,519
i don't know if insidious is the word

1582
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,950
but that's the one that comes to mind

1583
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:39,280
right now

1584
00:50:37,949 --> 00:50:41,598
[Laughter]

1585
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,359
so so so far we've been talking about

1586
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,280
the blood test because that's something

1587
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:47,598
that we're all kind of familiar with

1588
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,160
we've all seen our ranges

1589
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,760
and we could probably do an entire show

1590
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,239
just talking about

1591
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,760
a blood test and how to go through each

1592
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:57,679
aspect of it and how it could

1593
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,880
impact the endocannabinoid system and

1594
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,799
maybe we'll do that

1595
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,160
but for today let's let's move on

1596
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,079
because i think that i think that both

1597
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,519
patients and caregivers have gotten a

1598
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,960
good taste of

1599
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:11,440
of what there could be to unearth

1600
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,800
in a blood test i mean i know that i'm

1601
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,960
gonna go back and look at my recent

1602
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,800
blood work with whole new eyes now

1603
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,000
but let's move on to the next one so so

1604
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,400
what other analytics

1605
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,519
do you um do look at to help get that

1606
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,599
snapshot

1607
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,039
so that you know in what ways to

1608
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,519
diagnose and

1609
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,960
give protocol to a patient sure yeah so

1610
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,318
i i think the next one is that's the

1611
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,440
biggest one that's and we touched on

1612
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:36,480
this is healthy hormones right so

1613
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,519
what what and i tend to use a lot of

1614
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,000
um questionnaires around this and again

1615
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:42,559
we could

1616
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,159
probably go quite some time on this but

1617
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,440
certainly like i said i think when i'm

1618
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,039
taking a look at this where i've been

1619
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,240
spending a lot of time with patients i

1620
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,599
don't know whether it's just the patient

1621
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,759
population that's

1622
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,519
coming in right at this moment but but

1623
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,440
certainly

1624
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:56,960
obviously in the the world that we live

1625
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
in now stress levels are through the

1626
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,480
roof

1627
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,960
with people right you know and so

1628
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,719
super key indicators you know that i

1629
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,400
think really impact endocannabinoid

1630
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,799
function are things like

1631
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,599
you know that that stress hormone

1632
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,160
cortisol

1633
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,119
epinephrine norepinephrine you know

1634
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,838
dopamine

1635
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,079
type parts of that and so that leads me

1636
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,000
down sort of taking a good hard look at

1637
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,318
at where these stress hormones comes in

1638
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,400
and questionnaires are usually

1639
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:26,239
you know the most straightforward way i

1640
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,760
mean when i start taking a look at

1641
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,838
adrenal stress

1642
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,680
you know and and sort of these elevated

1643
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:33,199
cortisol you know adrenaline nor

1644
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:35,279
adrenaline pathways

1645
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,399
you know sleep is always a big indicator

1646
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,760
you know i i really

1647
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,119
i try and get patients to tell me okay a

1648
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,160
little bit what's your sleep looking

1649
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,519
like

1650
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:42,799
you know and if people are coming in

1651
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:44,400
because again there's different ways

1652
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,160
that people don't sleep well and

1653
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,880
certainly i think you know

1654
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,960
if i take a look at where a vast

1655
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,920
majority of my patients are using

1656
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,000
you know cannabinoid therapies it's

1657
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,240
certainly in the area of sleep

1658
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,760
all right so but i think that for some

1659
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,639
patients it works and for some patients

1660
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,559
it doesn't and

1661
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,639
and again that goes into sort of that

1662
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,800
regulatory effect of

1663
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,440
you know are you sort of winding someone

1664
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,440
down by having more gaba in their system

1665
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,119
you know or you know are they starting

1666
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,559
to be stressed out and is this cortisol

1667
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,760
and so there's that interplay between

1668
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,440
the stress response and these

1669
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,680
neurotransmitters

1670
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,760
so what's this question you know so

1671
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:22,960
sleep so i ask patients for example if

1672
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,880
i'm trying to root out

1673
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,880
okay is there a stress response and this

1674
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,079
is usually something like cortisol is a

1675
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,838
big one right

1676
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,200
you can get a good indicator about okay

1677
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,960
first of all are you difficult having

1678
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,000
difficulty falling asleep at night and

1679
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,559
what does that look like

1680
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,480
so a patient for example that you know

1681
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,920
they need to get to bed by a certain

1682
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,599
time frame if they're not in bed and

1683
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,119
asleep between nine and ten

1684
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,720
you know suddenly they get a second win

1685
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,559
and they're up and about

1686
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:49,759
again um you know that's almost always a

1687
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,040
pretty good indicator that they're

1688
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,280
getting a little bit of a second

1689
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,358
cortisol spike which is unusual

1690
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,319
your cortisol should be sort of winding

1691
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:58,000
down

1692
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:59,759
towards the end of the day you know it

1693
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,358
peaks in the morning and then it tapers

1694
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,119
off throughout the day

1695
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:04,239
but if it starts to come up a little bit

1696
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,160
at the end of the day you're going to

1697
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:07,919
see this this sleep issue

1698
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:10,480
you know and so that becomes something

1699
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,639
that will will probably

1700
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,240
impact your response to cannabinoids

1701
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,400
like you may find that the cannabinoids

1702
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:19,118
knock you out and certainly depending on

1703
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,838
the the the form that you're using right

1704
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,920
you know i mean

1705
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:24,318
and i'm sure you've had this

1706
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,159
conversation many times you know orally

1707
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:27,838
you know cannabinoids take longer to set

1708
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:28,960
in but you get that six day window

1709
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:30,719
effect and you get a little bit more of

1710
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,679
those psychoactive compounds because of

1711
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:33,519
that sort of

1712
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,039
first pass liver function there a little

1713
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,199
bit as well too so

1714
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:38,798
you know but if some people are vaping

1715
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:40,558
or something like that

1716
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:41,759
you know they may not are using you know

1717
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,440
different forms of it that have a little

1718
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,200
bit more rapid onset that might clear

1719
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,880
out a little bit more quickly so

1720
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,399
you know a patient that's vaping i

1721
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,000
usually recommend vaping as opposed to

1722
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,280
smoking just because of my environmental

1723
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,798
medicine

1724
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,798
background and smoking is not something

1725
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:56,480
that i try to i try to discourage as

1726
00:54:54,798 --> 00:55:00,239
much as possible

1727
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,679
um you know an hour and a half two hours

1728
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,118
in suddenly they'll be up again so you

1729
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:04,558
really need to take a look at that

1730
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,920
cortisol response and again there's

1731
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,280
different ways you can deal with that

1732
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,519
you know whether that's

1733
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,599
meditation winding down taking a look at

1734
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,199
your use of electronics beforehand what

1735
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,880
does your stress sleep hydra

1736
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,279
gene look like you know there's some

1737
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,960
herbs that i use that are quite helpful

1738
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,000
in there that kind of synergize nicely

1739
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,240
with cannabinoids there

1740
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,920
as well too so that's there's that's

1741
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:27,279
that's a really interesting point about

1742
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,440
um the the lights in the evenings and

1743
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,319
that second potential cortisol spike

1744
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,079
because

1745
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:33,519
you know clearly i talk with patients

1746
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,920
about you know

1747
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:37,759
sleeping in cannabis all the time and

1748
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,599
the number one thing that comes up with

1749
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,400
people is i ask them do you drink coffee

1750
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,838
right

1751
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,318
because because people are like oh i've

1752
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:47,279
got such insomnia but like i know that

1753
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:49,279
coffee's got a half-life of 14 hours

1754
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,760
and so that means that by the time

1755
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,760
they're drinking their coffee tomorrow

1756
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,960
they still have this morning's coffee

1757
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,680
still in them

1758
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,838
and so i encourage them to you know cut

1759
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:02,558
down on or get rid of the coffee or

1760
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:04,480
caffeine and you know their their

1761
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,160
insomnia will probably go away and

1762
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,079
you know after they look at me with

1763
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,519
utter shock um

1764
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,280
you know they're all like listen i'd

1765
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:14,639
rather keep the caffeine

1766
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,040
and just use more thc to get to sleep

1767
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:19,118
right i mean that's that's not uncommon

1768
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:21,838
but this idea of the blue lights and

1769
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,480
using electronics at night of which i am

1770
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,159
absolutely guilty of it's an interesting

1771
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,159
idea that

1772
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:34,239
if poor sleep is uh decreasing

1773
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:38,000
our cannabinoid uptake and effectiveness

1774
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:41,199
and poor sleep comes from using

1775
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,880
my phone in bed at night and getting a

1776
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:43,358
second wind and hanging out for two

1777
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,400
hours

1778
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,920
on bed reading stuff what this

1779
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,000
you know if we backtrack that all the

1780
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,280
way back my

1781
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,798
using my devices at night is hurting my

1782
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,440
endocannabinoid system

1783
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:58,000
and that is not something i think is

1784
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,519
immediately

1785
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,679
apparent to most folks it certainly

1786
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,920
wasn't to me until now

1787
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,759
yeah and certainly you know again if we

1788
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,240
you think about it in the context of

1789
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,920
of a thermostat right you know i mean

1790
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:10,959
you know my thermostat goes and tries to

1791
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,639
heat the house without

1792
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,000
all the windows and doors open well

1793
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,639
that's gonna be a little bit more good

1794
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,400
example

1795
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,960
yeah right there's there's only there's

1796
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,119
only so much capacity that you can and i

1797
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,400
think that you know i mean

1798
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,920
this touches on you know some of the

1799
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,358
genetics that we talked about it talks

1800
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,599
about sort of the nutritional

1801
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,558
capacity it talks about the hormonal

1802
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,039
environment

1803
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,559
you know so you know all those things so

1804
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,759
again you know it's sort of like

1805
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,119
okay how do i optimize this system and

1806
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,799
you know and this is the interesting

1807
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,000
thing right is i think

1808
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,559
i think that the thing that's become

1809
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,199
most apparent to me here is is that your

1810
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,200
your body

1811
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:48,159
it seems to me and there's probably

1812
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,519
people that are much smarter than me

1813
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:51,118
that could expect you know they could

1814
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,719
explain this or maybe poke holes in this

1815
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,160
argument so

1816
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,558
please feel free to i'd love to learn

1817
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:58,399
about this but but what i find is

1818
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,559
for example like let's take a look at

1819
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,280
the stress response

1820
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,319
and talk about inflammation and what i

1821
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,880
want to use this

1822
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:07,599
example to demonstrate is it isn't turn

1823
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,039
one on

1824
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:14,720
turn one off it's turn both on

1825
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:17,679
and then turn one off so what ends up

1826
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:20,719
happening is you get a faster response

1827
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:23,118
if you have the sort of you know the the

1828
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,399
the driver and the inhibitor going at

1829
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,358
the same time so there's a

1830
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,519
tension created in the system right and

1831
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:31,920
what happens is that so for example

1832
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,960
when we take a look at cortisol response

1833
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,159
cortisol

1834
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,838
is a immunosuppressant right it it's an

1835
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,039
anti-inflammatory anybody that's taken

1836
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:41,519
prednisone or

1837
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:44,558
you know will will appreciate that so

1838
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:47,599
it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory

1839
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,359
at the same time cortotrophic releasing

1840
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,240
hormone which is the hormone that

1841
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:55,679
stimulates the response of that

1842
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:58,639
also has an impact on vagal nerve tone

1843
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:00,318
which drives a pro-inflammatory response

1844
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:02,400
so you've got the same mechanism

1845
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:04,079
like different branches of the cortisol

1846
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,680
result being anti-inflammatory

1847
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,480
but then pro-inflammatory at the same

1848
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:10,000
time

1849
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,519
and if you think about it it's like okay

1850
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,318
well i'm going to run away from

1851
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:17,679
i'll use a distinctly canadian response

1852
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:19,039
you know the the grizzly bear

1853
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,960
you don't want to wait for your system

1854
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,239
to come online if they've you know given

1855
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,159
you a club or two and you're running

1856
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,759
away like crazy so you want your system

1857
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:26,639
to come online so basically as your

1858
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,079
stress response

1859
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:30,798
drops suddenly it unleashes the

1860
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,400
anti-inflammatory effect

1861
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:35,039
you know on your nervous system which is

1862
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,720
wired to get you the hell out of dodge

1863
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,318
you know suddenly shuts down and calms

1864
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:39,759
down now the other one can basically

1865
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,838
cascade in on it

1866
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,839
so i think the endocannabinoid system

1867
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,880
probably has that same type of tension

1868
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:46,798
in there and then you've got all these

1869
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,240
other modifiers around it as well too

1870
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,639
and when we talk about

1871
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:52,399
the lack of sleep or the dietary issues

1872
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:55,440
on top of that suddenly

1873
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,200
you're you're taking away you you're

1874
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,880
limiting the resiliency of it you're

1875
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,000
kind of sort of cornering it in a little

1876
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,358
bit so that you limit that

1877
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,480
response a bit that way wow

1878
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:07,039
all right so so so far we have talked

1879
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,079
about

1880
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:13,039
um the analytics that are helpful that

1881
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,880
come from blood tests and hormone tests

1882
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:16,480
and you've alluded a couple times to

1883
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,760
genetic screens

1884
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,039
and especially the 23andme and again

1885
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,079
you already mentioned this but we're

1886
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:27,119
going to set aside the

1887
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:30,160
concerns that many people have about

1888
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,160
whether or not there are identifying um

1889
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,798
aspects of their health that are going

1890
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:35,759
into

1891
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:36,798
these large data sets and and and

1892
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,640
whether or not people want to

1893
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,159
participate we're just going to set that

1894
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,078
aside for this conversation because

1895
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:43,759
again that's a whole nother show what

1896
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,480
we're going to focus on though is the

1897
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,599
usefulness of this kind of a test for

1898
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,639
the patient

1899
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,440
so so what what do these

1900
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,838
this these variety of tests show us that

1901
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:59,119
is worth

1902
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:59,119
noting sure yeah so

1903
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:03,519
again you know you can break this out

1904
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:06,078
into the endocannabinoid genetics

1905
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:06,559
you know and then the nutritional stuff

1906
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,480
you know

1907
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,559
and and sort of hormone metabolism

1908
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,240
things like that and and so where i

1909
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,200
start to take a look at here is

1910
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:14,879
you know some of the things you can

1911
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:15,838
start to see is you know the cannabinoid

1912
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,559
receptor and

1913
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:19,279
and you know dopamine receptors and such

1914
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,000
you know you see

1915
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,519
you see some genetic variants where you

1916
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,079
know these receptors are

1917
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,519
are more responsive or less responsive

1918
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,480
and that starts to set up you know are

1919
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:30,798
some patients

1920
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,639
you're more likely to to you know become

1921
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,358
a little bit more hooked on you know

1922
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:35,679
habitual cannabis use you know they get

1923
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,759
the

1924
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:39,440
the reward seeking response from that a

1925
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,040
little bit and they tend to go down that

1926
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,079
pathway so certainly that's something to

1927
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:43,599
be aware of

1928
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:45,200
you know when you're taking a look and

1929
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,119
and that what you're going to provide

1930
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,960
from a formulation standpoint

1931
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,640
you know so there's there's that aspect

1932
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,519
of it you know we can also start to dig

1933
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,769
into

1934
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:54,559
you know some of these um

1935
01:01:52,769 --> 01:01:57,119
[Music]

1936
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,640
enzymes that you know drive the

1937
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,720
different aspects of

1938
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,639
the the cannabinoid system right so you

1939
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:05,519
can take a look at

1940
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,558
you know pha you know fatty acid amide

1941
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:10,480
hydrolase

1942
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:12,559
you know magl another one as well too

1943
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,240
and degrade that and you know those

1944
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,200
enzymes kind of give a sense of how

1945
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:17,919
quickly you know these endocannabinoids

1946
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,519
hang around

1947
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,519
inside your your your synapse the gap

1948
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:25,280
between your nerves on that as well too

1949
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:26,239
so again it just gives you a sense of

1950
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,119
what's the

1951
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,798
the resiliency of that system so you can

1952
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,720
start to build out some sense of

1953
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,719
of that you know certainly where i start

1954
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:35,679
to take a look at it is things like you

1955
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:37,038
know

1956
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:39,679
because most patients come in here and

1957
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:41,520
again i think your your comment a bit

1958
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,358
earlier on about how we tend to have a

1959
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:44,480
patient population that have exhausted

1960
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:45,759
other options

1961
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,679
we tend to have a little bit more of the

1962
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,039
canaries and the coal mines so

1963
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:50,879
certainly i tend to see some of the

1964
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,480
stuff that i also saw in my multiply

1965
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,119
chemically sensitive patients which is

1966
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,159
that

1967
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,318
you know which is very similar

1968
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:58,480
population in some respects

1969
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:00,639
is that they have genetic variants and

1970
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,480
things like their ability to clear out

1971
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:03,838
these enzymes for example if we are

1972
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,079
these compounds like let's talk about

1973
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:08,558
your caffeine example that you use

1974
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,720
some people genetically um don't clear

1975
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,798
out caffeine well some do just fine

1976
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:14,719
you know and so you know these are you

1977
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,400
know and again i suspect that the people

1978
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:17,679
that are a little bit more sensitive to

1979
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,079
caffeine

1980
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:21,358
um you know are are again sort of these

1981
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,280
people that have some of these genetic

1982
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:25,440
variants about clearance of cytochrome

1983
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,440
enzymes and stat and that may

1984
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,559
impact clearance of other medications

1985
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,559
and other substances

1986
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,920
it's um you know again a whole other

1987
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,160
conversation we can talk about

1988
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,838
google's you know i think it's called

1989
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:37,598
alpha one is their new

1990
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:39,440
artificial intelligence that looks at

1991
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,519
protein folding

1992
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,119
uh on it and it came up with some really

1993
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:44,719
interesting stuff which is that you know

1994
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,838
sort of

1995
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:50,558
genes appear to organize

1996
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:52,239
in biochemical pathways you know so that

1997
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,720
you know they kind of support each other

1998
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:55,838
so

1999
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:57,519
um like for example i did 23andme

2000
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:58,880
and it turns out that i'm genetically

2001
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:01,679
pre-programmed to have to have

2002
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,798
cod liver oil my swedish and swiss

2003
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:04,798
background

2004
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:07,038
pretty much uh means that i don't do

2005
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,719
vitamin d terribly well my vitamin a

2006
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:10,559
i don't convert it from plants terribly

2007
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,959
well and my oils the

2008
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,798
the hemp the plant-based oils i can't

2009
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,440
really convert them into the sort of the

2010
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:18,559
omega-3 stuff that we find in fish oils

2011
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,318
you know but that that

2012
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,160
group of them i've seen that repeatedly

2013
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:23,759
in patient populations that

2014
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:25,279
you know people of northern european

2015
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,039
descent and things like that and some of

2016
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,640
the first nations populations

2017
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,079
you know seem to have these things where

2018
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:32,480
their vitamin d

2019
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:34,480
and their their essential fatty acids

2020
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,039
and fat soluble vitamins seem to be tied

2021
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,559
together

2022
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,480
and you know we see this in other

2023
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,880
different elements as well too

2024
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,838
so that's that's a really cool element

2025
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,440
of it and then

2026
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:44,880
we go down the pathway of things like

2027
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,440
again depending on what our patients are

2028
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,480
looking at

2029
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:51,440
so you know anxiety stress mood

2030
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,798
depression you know chronic pain i

2031
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,798
really start taking a look at a lot of

2032
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:56,318
the tryptophan stuff around this as well

2033
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:58,159
too there's some really

2034
01:04:56,318 --> 01:04:59,679
interesting aspects because that ties in

2035
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,920
both of the b vitamins that we talked a

2036
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:03,440
little bit earlier about folic acid b12

2037
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,358
and b6 support

2038
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,358
and then also the ability to convert you

2039
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:08,960
know the amino acid tryptophan into 5

2040
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:11,119
hydroxy tryptophan and so there's some

2041
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,400
genetic variation on that too

2042
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,760
so these are the types of things that

2043
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,720
you know as you start to take a look

2044
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,319
they show up and

2045
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:19,279
different platforms have different

2046
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:21,440
elements of it i just use the 23andme

2047
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,359
raw data and load that into a multiple

2048
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,200
of different you know genomic platforms

2049
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:27,440
to start to identify those and

2050
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:29,118
you know as several of them that i use

2051
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,559
i'm working on one right now with

2052
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,160
another company to try and

2053
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:34,798
make a little bit more specific sort of

2054
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,239
functional cannabinoid medicine platform

2055
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:37,838
and so hopefully we'll have that out in

2056
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,199
the next year so that's going to be

2057
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,558
popular

2058
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,239
i hope so yeah i think it'd be

2059
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,599
interesting i mean the challenge is

2060
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:44,000
trying to simplify this stuff down

2061
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,680
because

2062
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,199
you know again it's i realize i'm

2063
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:48,879
probably just you know people are kind

2064
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:49,358
of getting a fire hose effect right now

2065
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,358
and

2066
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:53,038
giving little snippets of it as well but

2067
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,358
um but hopefully we can make it much

2068
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,119
more practical and patient-friendly so

2069
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:58,880
and i that that idea of being

2070
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,960
overwhelmed by the details

2071
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,559
like that's not lost on me you know like

2072
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,199
you're right we are kind of moving

2073
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,680
around

2074
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,719
and there's a lot of vocabulary in this

2075
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:09,038
episode

2076
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,000
but it's also true to life right i mean

2077
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,079
like this is

2078
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,159
what it's like to be a patient like

2079
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:18,480
anybody who is still with us

2080
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:21,679
on the episode you know you know people

2081
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:25,199
have got to decide that they're going to

2082
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:27,279
care enough to learn the vocabulary

2083
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:28,719
if they are going to become captains of

2084
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:32,319
their own health

2085
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:34,719
um we cannot have optimum health

2086
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:36,159
let alone individualized cannabis

2087
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:39,919
medicine

2088
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:43,199
in a western healthcare system

2089
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:45,039
that is designed more to keep us on

2090
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:49,118
pharmaceuticals than it is to

2091
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:51,280
heal us and move us on our way and so

2092
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,400
you know while while at certain times

2093
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,519
the vocabulary

2094
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,200
that you've used even you know um washed

2095
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:58,880
me in new ideas like oh i've got i've

2096
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:00,318
got a long list of things that i'm gonna

2097
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,599
google when we're done here

2098
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:04,079
but that's what it's like to be a

2099
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:08,318
patient that that is what it's like

2100
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:10,880
and so um i think that

2101
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:11,440
cannabis patients probably more than

2102
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,720
most

2103
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,559
are used to this because

2104
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:18,480
we we we've already talked about how

2105
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,000
cannabis patients are generally outliers

2106
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,400
because the rest of the medical system

2107
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,119
has

2108
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,559
given up on them and then they've so

2109
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,920
they've had to take their research

2110
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,839
into their own hands and so those are

2111
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:33,440
probably the people that this

2112
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:36,239
episode is is most targeted for

2113
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,798
because what we're giving i mean like

2114
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:38,078
you know

2115
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:39,838
from helping enough of my friends like

2116
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,240
i've got rheumatoid arthritis friends

2117
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:42,558
and

2118
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:43,919
um and hypothyroid friends and all these

2119
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,599
folks

2120
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,599
we there are little snippets throughout

2121
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,079
the episode where people are like ooh

2122
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:51,280
there's a new search term for me that i

2123
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:54,400
had not considered

2124
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,760
on whatever topic and i think that's how

2125
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:00,559
self-empowered patients have to go about

2126
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,359
their medical education so so anyway i

2127
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,920
agree with you

2128
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:04,880
and i think it's par for the course yeah

2129
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,318
well and i i

2130
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,519
i would say again you know i mean this

2131
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:08,719
is interesting because again you know

2132
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:10,798
when i take a look i mean i've been a

2133
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:13,838
naturopathic doctor now for

2134
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:17,039
graduated in 1998 and so you know i had

2135
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:17,519
you know undergraduate and naturopathic

2136
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:19,198
college

2137
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,719
as well with that for five years you

2138
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:21,358
know five years of naturopathic college

2139
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,279
four years of

2140
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:24,960
undergraduate you know so i've kind of

2141
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,400
been steeped in this for a really long

2142
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,520
time in terms of this integrative

2143
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,759
alternative medicine

2144
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,120
what we're talking about in in cannabis

2145
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,520
medicine isn't

2146
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:34,479
new i mean this is something that sort

2147
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,319
of the holistic

2148
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,479
integrative medicine i mean you know

2149
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,920
when i started off in in this area i

2150
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:42,399
mean i remember going down and i

2151
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,119
grew up in victoria on vancouver island

2152
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:47,119
and i remember going down to uh the the

2153
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:48,798
chinatown and getting chinese herbal

2154
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:51,679
medicines and walking into this

2155
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:52,000
and it was like it was just you know the

2156
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,399
the

2157
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,759
smells and and this you know you're just

2158
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,039
like oh my god this is just so

2159
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,359
fascinating you know but

2160
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,359
you know this little chinese fellow you

2161
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,120
know giving me all these herbs these

2162
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,120
wonderful herbs and it was just you know

2163
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:08,158
and now we take a look and go into any

2164
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:10,640
you know sort of you know choices

2165
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:12,238
you know integrative pharmacy whatever

2166
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,039
and you see what the evolutions look

2167
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,759
like and

2168
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:16,479
and cannabis is is you know has the

2169
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,679
potential

2170
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,959
and just following that same course but

2171
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,119
just in a very

2172
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,359
magnified effect simply because the the

2173
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:25,679
population behind that that's driving it

2174
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,838
is

2175
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,359
is i think there's just pent up demand

2176
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:30,158
and suddenly it released and so now it's

2177
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,400
moving

2178
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:34,238
but i mean the what you're talking about

2179
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,838
with cannabis patients is exactly what i

2180
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:36,798
find in my patient population that's

2181
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,559
non-cannabis

2182
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:40,399
they're all very engaged they're doing

2183
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,679
the research i have these conversations

2184
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,679
with them i mean i

2185
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,520
i never underestimate the capacity of my

2186
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,359
patients you know to understand the

2187
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,719
concepts that i'm giving them it's if

2188
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,640
they're not getting it's because i'm not

2189
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,399
doing a good enough job explaining it

2190
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,079
right you know so i need to come back

2191
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,679
around and find out that language that's

2192
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:58,079
going there and so i know that we've

2193
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,840
slipped into some jargon around that but

2194
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:01,119
you know again

2195
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,199
certainly you know we can you can you

2196
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:04,479
can sort of dial that back in a lot of

2197
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:06,319
different ways but

2198
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:07,678
it's it's it's patients being empowered

2199
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:09,039
it's patients starting to look into this

2200
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,840
saying look you know

2201
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:13,760
i don't i don't the current model is not

2202
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:17,119
serving us well the symptom-oriented

2203
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:19,199
thing we're just dealing with a symptom

2204
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:20,960
is kind of the equivalent of of you know

2205
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:22,799
pulling the batteries out of my smoke

2206
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,920
alarm while there's toast burning in my

2207
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,360
toaster

2208
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,119
right you know it gets rid of the

2209
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:28,399
irritation on it but there's still this

2210
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:30,000
underlying issue that's kind of

2211
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:31,039
happening here a little bit that needs

2212
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,079
to be addressed

2213
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:34,319
and i think that's what patients are

2214
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:37,920
just struggling to find and i again

2215
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:40,559
i don't there's just a medical system

2216
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,480
that that they're trained to look at

2217
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,159
that and it's like okay well i need to

2218
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:45,599
you know i always joke with my patients

2219
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:46,719
a little bit it's like your doctor is

2220
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,800
concerned with you not

2221
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:50,399
dying they don't really care about how

2222
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,800
you feel about it

2223
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,319
right and and and i don't mean that to

2224
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,600
be overly critical i mean it's like look

2225
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:57,359
they've got more pressing things just

2226
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,640
make sure you're not dead the fact that

2227
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:00,000
you've got a little bit of body aches

2228
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,600
and pains because you're taking your

2229
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,719
stat and they're like well

2230
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,719
this is what it is at least you're not

2231
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:06,319
going to die of a heart attack right so

2232
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,239
the intention behind that is

2233
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:09,759
is caring and genuine and all the rest

2234
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:11,039
of that it's just that you know what are

2235
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,320
they going to do about it like what's

2236
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:13,679
the tool that they're going to have i

2237
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:15,119
mean the option for them is to put them

2238
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,719
on the medication switch it around a

2239
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:18,719
little bit or stop it

2240
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,560
you know but you know again all of us i

2241
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,719
mean even in this conversation i mean

2242
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,480
there's a deluge i mean this has been

2243
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,319
20 years of experience that i've got

2244
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:28,158
locked up into my brain i think that it

2245
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:29,039
would be unfair to expect someone else

2246
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,960
to try and

2247
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:32,800
have that same type of experience and be

2248
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,399
able to bring that to bear

2249
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,920
you know and so you do what you do and

2250
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:38,079
just like i don't know i mean

2251
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,840
there's a billion different topics you

2252
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:41,119
could bring up that i'm like

2253
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,400
i don't know who i held a lot about that

2254
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:44,238
one i'm gonna need to go do some work on

2255
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:45,679
that and talk to some people so

2256
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,439
i think at the end of the day you build

2257
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:48,480
a healthcare team of people you become

2258
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:50,399
your best

2259
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,399
advocate you know you do your homework

2260
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:55,198
on this you you be inquisitive and

2261
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:58,479
curious and you know you persist

2262
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:58,799
uh here on uh vashon where uh where i

2263
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:01,678
live

2264
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,039
ashon island um about i don't know gosh

2265
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,840
has it been six years now

2266
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:08,479
um we formed a patient and cannabis

2267
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,520
enthusiast community

2268
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:14,959
social group here called vimeo and

2269
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:18,560
you know we we continually use this term

2270
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,840
um scrappy street medicine because

2271
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,440
so many of the people who have come to

2272
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,560
endocannabinopathic

2273
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:29,919
medicine because they were

2274
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,800
fringe and black swans and outside of

2275
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:35,279
the medicine

2276
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:38,480
by average they have had to self-teach

2277
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:40,000
and certainly before google it was

2278
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:42,479
you know nearly impossible to do this

2279
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,198
kind of research but it's becoming

2280
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:46,879
easier and easier and we all have kind

2281
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:50,238
of embraced this idea

2282
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:53,520
that um

2283
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:57,198
we work together to bring our

2284
01:12:53,520 --> 01:13:00,960
pre-existing scrappy street medicine

2285
01:12:57,198 --> 01:13:04,079
out of the bro science and into

2286
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,719
an understanding that you're talking

2287
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,319
about

2288
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,920
of integrative medicine that's been

2289
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:11,039
around for a while

2290
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:14,158
but also has had the difficulty of

2291
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:17,679
not being incredibly popular or

2292
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:20,879
accessible to most people and

2293
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:22,239
and is not taught in regular school

2294
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,159
right and so

2295
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:26,000
you know even though to you you know

2296
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:26,960
you've been studying this for over 20

2297
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,079
years

2298
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,520
for most of us you know just simple

2299
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:33,600
stuff like including

2300
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,840
environmental medicine what what in your

2301
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,760
house is off-gassing something

2302
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,199
can be mind-blowing because a lot of

2303
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,520
people are taught that

2304
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:43,839
you know all the all the industrial

2305
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,560
manufacturing is fine you know

2306
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,679
and so and so that's that's how i you

2307
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,000
know that's how a lot of

2308
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:52,560
a lot of folks come up right as as you

2309
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,439
know scrappy street medicine folks who

2310
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,640
then

2311
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:58,639
get access to professionals like you who

2312
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,600
are now more accessible to us in

2313
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,000
cannabis

2314
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,520
because you know you're not shamed and

2315
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,960
it's not as taboo to come on

2316
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,360
on a podcast like this and and we get to

2317
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,840
hear

2318
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:10,960
some you know hints and best practices

2319
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,319
from somebody who's

2320
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:17,119
who's inside the specialty so

2321
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:19,519
before before we wrap up and go to um

2322
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:21,519
our next commercial break uh chris

2323
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,280
were there any other tests that you

2324
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,719
wanted to make sure that you pointed out

2325
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:28,559
for caregivers or or

2326
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,000
patients that they'll want to take a

2327
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,840
look at for clues

2328
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,920
we've you've mentioned uh the blood

2329
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,880
tests uh hormone

2330
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,440
tests and the genetic screens so far

2331
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,119
sure

2332
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,119
i think probably the last ones would be

2333
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:44,238
that what kind of touched on was the

2334
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:46,158
fats part of it right you know i mean i

2335
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:47,678
there's there's some questionnaires that

2336
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:48,479
i use you know things like you know do

2337
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,800
you have dry

2338
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:51,759
skin you know uh you know what's with

2339
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,039
inflammation you know

2340
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,960
there's some different conditions that

2341
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:57,439
you can use to get a sense of

2342
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,960
um you know what what the fatty acid

2343
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:00,639
status is i mean and

2344
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,480
for the most part if you've got dry

2345
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,840
scaly skin that's always dry you

2346
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:05,839
probably are pretty much deficient in

2347
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,119
fats so there you go um

2348
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,199
you know you might take a look at things

2349
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:10,238
like vitamin d status that's an easy

2350
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:11,759
test to run

2351
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:13,359
you know has significant impacts

2352
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,199
especially for for those of us you know

2353
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:16,960
up near the border and above the border

2354
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:20,479
here you know above the wall so to speak

2355
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:22,000
yeah um you know uh so so those are

2356
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,678
important things that i think are our

2357
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,399
elements of it there's there's one last

2358
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,480
blood work

2359
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:28,079
test that i that i like there's one

2360
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:30,399
called ggt

2361
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,600
it's a liver enzyme it's usually used to

2362
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:33,198
test for

2363
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,560
alcohol most doctors will look at if

2364
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:36,079
it's elevated so you need to stop

2365
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,080
drinking and

2366
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:39,920
but what it is actually is it's a really

2367
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:41,920
uh it's a decent marker for something

2368
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,920
called glutathione which is a super

2369
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,679
important antioxidant

2370
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,840
it's it's built out of an amino acid

2371
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,399
called an acetyl cysteine that actually

2372
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,760
is

2373
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:51,759
showing some real promise and things

2374
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,760
like helping with addiction

2375
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,320
and and you know neurotransmitters

2376
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,440
certain neuroplasticity brain health

2377
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,559
parkinson's you know antioxidant status

2378
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,399
you know this type of thing and i think

2379
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,800
that's that's one that i tend to check a

2380
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:05,039
lot

2381
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,400
and you know and i take a look at those

2382
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,399
numbers and it's one of those ones that

2383
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:09,759
even though the upper level of it is

2384
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:11,439
is fairly high there's been some

2385
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,640
interesting papers published that showed

2386
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:15,599
it's actually based on

2387
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:17,039
insurance actuarial tables that show

2388
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,360
that you know some

2389
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,439
optimal levels occur at much lower

2390
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:22,079
levels within the normal range of that

2391
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:23,839
as well too

2392
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,119
so that's a big one that i like to take

2393
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,880
a look at as well too

2394
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:28,158
awesome thank you so we're going to go

2395
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,560
ahead and take that second

2396
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:31,839
short break and be right back after the

2397
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:35,120
break

2398
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:37,600
we are going to go into talking about

2399
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:40,238
whole foods your diet and how you can

2400
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,719
support your endocannabinoid system

2401
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:44,718
through your food choices you are

2402
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,640
listening to shaping fire and my guest

2403
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:47,920

[Music]

2406
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,719
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

2407
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,800
growing is so valued by farmers

2408
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:58,880
is because the mycelium networks in the

2409
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,760
soil remain established from year to

2410
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,520
year

2411
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,679
and we know these fungal networks are

2412
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,280
essential because they are the nutrient

2413
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,520
super highways that extend

2414
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:08,719
far and wide in the substrate to feed

2415
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,719
your plants

2416
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:13,119
the trouble with growing in new living

2417
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,960
soils or blended cocoa substrates

2418
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:17,359
is that it takes most of the plant's

2419
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,880
life just to create these mycelium

2420
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:21,920
highways

2421
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:24,079
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

2422
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:27,039
reduces that time and gets your plant

2423
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:29,039
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

2424
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:31,119
and it's three times the concentration

2425
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:34,319
of the other popular brand in the u.s

2426
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:36,158
at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal

2427
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:39,039
species selected specifically

2428
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:40,799
for cannabis cultivation dynomica is the

2429
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:42,158
result of 30 years of research and

2430
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,640
trials at the volcani

2431

agriculture research institute in israel

2432
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,840
it has also been vigorously trialled by

2433
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:52,239
cannabis and food growers across the u.s

2434
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,640
dynamico is now available at grow shops

2435
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:56,799

2436
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,079
i love using dynamico to both speed up

2437
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,000
the growth of the mycelium

2438
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:02,559
networks in the soil but also as a

2439
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,119
biostimulant to make clone cuttings more

2440
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,480
virile you can see side by side showing

2441
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:08,880

2444
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,480
and appreciate the importance of an

2445
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,119
active root zone in creating a thriving

brother seth and eric crawford continue

to release seeds to hemp farmers that

will be legal

test them these new varieties from

for farmers every time

2477
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:23,359
also these new varieties cannot be

2478
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,640
pollinated by your neighbor's

2479

uncontrolled pollen

2480
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:30,000
or a rogue male in your own crop either

2481
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,040
oregon cbd seeds are non-gmo certified

2482
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,840
too

without outside investment

2487
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,880
they continue to refuse outside

2488
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,560
investment that would change their

2489
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,279

welcome back you are listening to

2591
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:09,679
shaping fire i am your host shango los

2592
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,319
and our guest this week is naturopathic

2593
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,760
physician

2594
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:16,158
chris spooner so um in the first two

2595
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,880
sets we talked primarily about figuring

2596
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:20,000
out

2597
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:23,199
um what might be the problem and

2598
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,920
how best and what kinds of cannabinoids

2599
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:27,678
that we want to introduce into your body

2600
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,359
for optimum benefit from your

2601
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,600
cannabinopathic care

2602
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:33,119
and as we have sussed out that it can

2603
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:36,480
get really complex

2604
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:39,279
fast and the context for every single

2605
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:42,158
patient is slightly different and so

2606
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:44,319
today's episode has so far has not been

2607
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:45,279
the same solutions for everybody it's

2608
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:47,439
essentially

2609
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,960
here are a bunch of things to consider

2610
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:51,439
and then now you have to

2611
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,279
go on your own individualized path well

2612
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:54,559
set 3 is going to be a little different

2613
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:54,880
because we're going to be talking about

2614
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,760
the

2615
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,000
foods that you can eat that generally

2616
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,920
strengthen your endocannabinoid system

2617
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
and this is especially great especially

2618
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,800
for folks who either want to round

2619
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,600
out their cannabis use with food that's

2620
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,320
going to

2621
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,159
support their endocannabinoid system or

2622
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:14,000
folks who just can't really afford all

2623
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:16,719
the cannabinoids that they

2624
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,198
that they need but they do have access

2625
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,000
to

2626
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:21,359
clean food so um you know we've we've

2627
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,560
talked in the past with dr

2628
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:27,839
russo on an earlier episode about um his

2629
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:30,000
seminal paper about um uh you know

2630
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,679
particular foods that strengthen the

2631
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
endocannabinoid system but that has not

2632
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,800
been

2633
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,119
updated in a long time and chris i know

2634
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,239
that

2635
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:40,639
you work with patients all the time

2636
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:42,158
both as a naturopath but also in your in

2637
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:45,520
your species

2638
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,879
specificity of of the gut right and so

2639
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,840
you're talking about foods about the

2640
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,079
foods that they're eating

2641
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,319
all the time so why don't we start with

2642
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:55,119
the recommendations that you give

2643
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:55,679
your patient base on foods that they

2644
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:58,880
should

2645
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:00,480
eat for endocannabinoid health sure

2646
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,600
yeah i know i mean it's um it's pretty

2647
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:03,039
straightforward i mean i think we've

2648
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,239
touched on a lot of these things you

2649
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:05,600
know i think you probably get won't be

2650
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:06,959
too surprising giving our previous

2651
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,079
conversation but

2652
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,920
um i try you know patients

2653
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,760
sometimes prefer supplements i prefer to

2654
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:16,560
try and get patients to do as much as

2655
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,119
food wise as they can uh to start off

2656
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,360
with and

2657
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:20,319
and so i mean i'd probably say for those

2658
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:21,599
of you that have been listening

2659
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:23,198
you know the first one i'd be going with

2660
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,159
is something like cod liver oil i mean

2661
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:25,359
most people it's

2662
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:26,879
it's they're looking at it going like

2663
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:28,158
well that just sounds downright

2664
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,840
disgusting

2665
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:31,920
but one of the things i really like

2666
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,880
about it is that it's got a couple

2667
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,000
things it's got

2668
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:39,039
vitamin a and vitamin d in it

2669
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,639
okay which is is fantastic you know and

2670
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:42,960
so for those people that genetically

2671
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,480
aren't able to do it it kind of bypasses

2672
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,399
you know that issue and then you've got

2673
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:48,959
it converted has a fair amount of what's

2674
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:50,559
called dha in it which is one of these

2675
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,880
essential fatty acids that's really

2676
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:56,159
helpful for brain health uh

2677
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:58,319
and its partner sort of epa um

2678
01:25:56,158 --> 01:25:59,599
is is a bit of an anti-inflammatory so i

2679
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,880
find that you know

2680
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,639
for those patients that are coming in

2681
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,319
with inflammatory illnesses or

2682
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,719
neurological stuff

2683
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:08,158
or you know inflammatory conditions like

2684
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:10,079
fibromyalgia and this type of thing i

2685
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:11,599
mean this is a good place to start you

2686
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:13,119
know arthritis pain

2687
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,560
you know this type of thing you know so

2688
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:18,800
you know a tablespoon a cod liver oil

2689
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,400
gets your a's and your d's your fat

2690
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,480
soluble vitamins and those important

2691
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:24,399
essential fatty acids you know and it's

2692
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:25,599
again we could certainly dig down deeper

2693
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:28,000
into the science behind

2694
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,199
why that is and whatever but you know i

2695
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,840
mean we we do see

2696
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:32,799
that you know omega-3 deficiencies

2697
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:35,039
definitely really

2698
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,639
impact you know sort of endocannabinoid

2699
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:38,079
you know particularly the neuronal

2700
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,159
functions as well too but also

2701
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:41,600
synergizes quite nicely through the

2702
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:43,119
anti-inflammatory effects so it

2703
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,440
synergizes really nicely with things

2704
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:45,920
like

2705
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:47,279
cbd so that that would be probably one

2706
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,520
of the first ones i'd be taking a look

2707
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:52,319
at there as well too

2708
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,880
the next one that i'm super fascinated

2709
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:55,759
by

2710
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,159
is this whole concept of the microbiome

2711
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,639
right

2712
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:00,238
you know and uh and so what i think that

2713
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,039
you start taking a look at here is this

2714
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:02,638
whole

2715
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:03,920
i forget what the paper was here i'm

2716
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,960
just gonna pull it up here real quick it

2717
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,880
was um

2718
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,520
yeah endocannabinoids the crossroad

2719
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:12,159
between the gut microbiota and host

2720
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,560
metabolism it was actually published in

2721
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:16,960
nature i think in 2016.

2722
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,159
a super fascinating article about this

2723
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,399
that talks about the role

2724
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:22,799
of the microbiome and actually how it

2725
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:24,399
impacts a lot of liver pathology um i

2726
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,840
don't know i suspect this isn't

2727
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:28,479
something that shows up on everybody's

2728
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,480
radar but

2729
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,079
is it an epidemic proportions here right

2730
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,760
and we always attributed that with

2731
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:37,198
alcohol use well it turns out

2732
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,960
it actually has a pretty significant

2733
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:41,519
component of you know

2734
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:43,158
disruptions in the gut microbiome and

2735
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,320
that seems to be impacted by

2736
01:27:43,158 --> 01:27:47,439
endocannabinoids

2737
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:48,960
interestingly enough so uh

2738
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:51,599
taking a look at what's happening within

2739
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,960
that that you know gut bacteria within

2740
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,280
the digestive tract

2741
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,920
i think is hugely important and you know

2742
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:59,519
again i could go on and on about

2743
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,158
the trials and tribulations and the

2744
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:05,199
disrespect shown to our hepatic

2745
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,719
liver system um but but i i won't i

2746
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:07,599
won't stand up for them on that soapbox

2747
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,480
right now

2748
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,840
but i certainly think you know uh

2749
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:14,559
anything that supports

2750
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:16,560
the bacteria in your gut and that would

2751
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,320
be something like you know a probiotic

2752
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,840
if you want to go down you know the

2753
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:21,759
foods that you would be looking at you'd

2754
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,840
be taking a look at fermented foods

2755
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,199
you know um you know your sauerkrauts

2756
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,840
your yogurts

2757
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:28,638
you know these types of things that that

2758
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,960
really

2759
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:32,400
they do two things one they supply

2760
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,800
bacteria and

2761
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:36,479
again it's there's a lot of subtleties

2762
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,520
in the quality of probiotics and that

2763
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,959
that

2764
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,800
certainly again we could go on long

2765
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,359
enough but suffice it to say

2766
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,719
a lot of the fiber and a lot of the like

2767
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:47,759
the the fermented

2768
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:49,279
by-products so for example in yogurt and

2769
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,440
milk products uh

2770
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:52,880
the sugar lactose is composed of

2771
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:54,960
galactose and

2772
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:57,679
glucose well you can get what's called

2773
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:59,279
the galacto-oligosaccharide which turns

2774
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,560
out to be very helpful for the gut

2775
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,279
microbiome and that's

2776
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,120
produced in yogurt you know along with

2777
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:06,079
sort of the the fermentation products

2778
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:08,399
and the sort of ph

2779
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:10,238
altering effects of that the lactic acid

2780
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:11,599
so i think fermented foods you know if

2781
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:12,638
you're dairy sensitive or things like

2782
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,079
that you could take a look at other

2783
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,359
different fermented foods

2784
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:17,439
in there but i think that's a super

2785
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:19,439
important thing and also a lot of people

2786
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:20,000
who are sensitive to dairy foods like i

2787
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:21,839
am

2788
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,679
actually are okay with the fermented

2789
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,360
ones so like you know you won't see me

2790
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:27,520
drinking a glass of milk

2791
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:28,399
but i can totally handle uh quality

2792
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,679
yogurt

2793
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:31,920
absolutely yeah and especially if you

2794
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:33,440
get like a grass-fed yogurt

2795
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,119
and why is that well it actually

2796
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:38,158
dovetails with the types of fats

2797
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:40,719
grass-fed animals have different omega-3

2798
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:42,158
uh you know fatty acid profiles in their

2799
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,000
milk that are skewed to the more

2800
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:45,599
beneficial ones too so there's

2801
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,719
a double whammy with stuff like that so

2802
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,560
if you could certainly tolerate a

2803
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:51,039
grass-fed yogurt

2804
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,159
great fantastic you know goats yogurt is

2805
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:52,719
probably another one that you could look

2806
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:54,799
at if you're

2807
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,480
if you're not too averse to goatee

2808
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,639
flavors but uh

2809
01:29:56,479 --> 01:29:59,839
you know you go from there so so that

2810
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,199
would be something that i think there

2811
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,920
are definitely things you can involve in

2812
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:03,839
there um

2813
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,000
fiber is super important you know

2814
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,480
especially for large bacteria this

2815
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,840
is again i'm not going to go too far

2816
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:11,439
down this rabbit hole but let's just

2817
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,679
suffice it to say that

2818
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:15,198
your gut bacteria is not the same below

2819
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:15,920
the stomach as it is in the large

2820
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:17,919
intestine

2821
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,039
it varies significantly in the types of

2822
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,800
bacteria

2823
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:22,880
you know what they do and what they

2824
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,159
produce and what they eat

2825
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,440
and the ones that we really want to

2826
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:26,879
emphasize going back to that

2827
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:30,559
conversation about

2828
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,440
butyrate that's you know again adding

2829
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,400
things like

2830
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:35,678
oat bran and psyllium husks and things

2831
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:37,679
like that those are the two big ones

2832
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:39,199
that i recommend on a regular basis

2833
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:40,960
but anything that you know you could add

2834
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:43,439
you know healthy fibers into it

2835
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,840
again some people have sensitivities

2836
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:47,678
around gluten and this type of thing so

2837
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,520
you know this is where you'll get a

2838
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:50,880
gluten-free oat or something along those

2839
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,440
lines might be something considered

2840
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,359
there

2841
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:55,039
you know rice brands can be part of that

2842
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:56,158
that start to bypass that as well too

2843
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:58,238
but getting in those

2844
01:30:56,158 --> 01:30:59,679
those fibers that the bacteria can start

2845
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:01,359
to work on and produce some of these

2846
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:03,359
really important compounds

2847
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:04,960
i think is really really important and

2848
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:06,079
again you know we could spend hours

2849
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,760
talking about that but

2850
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:09,519
i think if i were to make those three

2851
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,840
recommendations to patients

2852
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,120
that would be at as a dietary strategy

2853
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,960
overall

2854
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:16,639
i tend to encourage patients to move

2855
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:19,840
more towards that

2856
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:21,039
paleo keto type end of things and this

2857
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,880
is recognizing that

2858
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:24,079
not all diets there's a lot of caveats

2859
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,400
that go in this

2860
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:28,800
and certainly i'm not of the view of you

2861
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:30,000
know paleo means eat red meat and bacon

2862
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,320
and cream

2863
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,279
it means you know mediterranean type

2864
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:36,880
diets you know

2865
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:40,158
olive oils healthy oils fish avocado

2866
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:42,880
you know coconut oils you know organic

2867
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:45,119
safflower sunflower oils flax oils those

2868
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,639
types of things healthy nuts and seeds

2869
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:47,679
you know and again i think most people

2870
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:49,039
would be like yeah it sounds like a

2871
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:50,399
healthy diet i should probably do some

2872
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:51,198
more of that so if you're really trying

2873
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:53,359
to

2874
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:54,479
improve your endocannabinoid tone that's

2875
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:55,920
where i'd be leading and that's where i

2876
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:57,439
said most of my patients

2877
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,760
and then so like let's look at the

2878
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:02,319
opposite right you mentioned earlier

2879
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,560
um the idea of you know to having the

2880
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:06,319
heating on in your house but then having

2881
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,440
the window open so yeah you might be

2882
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:08,639
heating your house

2883
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:10,960
but all the good it's doing this is

2884
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:11,279
going right out the window and i see

2885
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,319
that

2886
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:16,479
so often when i go to conventions

2887
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:17,599
and you know people are all you know

2888
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:19,599
talking about

2889
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,520
you know cannabis medicine and patience

2890
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,840
and then we break for lunch

2891
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,800
and i watch these people eating like the

2892
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,840
crackiest

2893
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:29,039
you know fast food and i'm like oh you

2894
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,239
know essentially they're leaving their

2895
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:33,519
window open right

2896
01:32:30,238 --> 01:32:37,039
they they know about health but then

2897
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:39,840
they're actually putting you know

2898
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:40,560
tinder into their um into their body

2899
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,679
instead of

2900
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,719
like nice long burning logs right um

2901
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:50,239
so so will you speak a little bit to

2902
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:52,158
um the harm that processed foods do to

2903
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:53,439
the endocannabinoid system because yeah

2904
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:55,920
we want to increase

2905
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:57,759
the quality of the foods we are eating

2906
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,840
but at the same time we really

2907
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,360
should be getting rid of these other

2908
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,960
foods that are actually causing damage

2909
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:04,479
the endocannabinoid system at the same

2910
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,239
time

2911
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:07,678
yeah you know and again most people when

2912
01:33:06,238 --> 01:33:08,638
they see naturopathic physician they're

2913
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:09,760
pretty much being well he's going to

2914
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:12,880
take me off sugar

2915
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:14,639
dairy and wheat so myself

2916
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,880
might as well fit the stereotype and

2917
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:18,719
don't do that um

2918
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,920
but but no definitely i think when you

2919
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:20,960
take a look at particularly your

2920
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,158
processed foods

2921
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,600
you know i mean there's there's a number

2922
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:24,399
of different things that come into it i

2923
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,360
mean

2924
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:29,039
um and there's maybe there's a couple

2925
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:30,559
reasons that might surprise people if

2926
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:32,319
anybody wants an interesting read on it

2927
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:35,039
there's a book

2928
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:36,000
sugar salt fat that talks about you know

2929
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,158
sort of the fast

2930
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,198
food industry and the processed food

2931
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:41,119
industry

2932
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:42,879
you know and it was essentially an

2933
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:44,479
investigative journalist that had heard

2934
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,000
that a lot of the foods

2935
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:48,158
you know big companies general mills

2936
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,760
nabisco and rs i got together and one of

2937
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:51,599
them was kind of saying like one of the

2938
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,360
individuals was being like look

2939
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,800
we may be kind of moving into cigarette

2940
01:33:53,359 --> 01:33:56,000
territory here where suddenly it's going

2941
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,440
to become apparent that there were some

2942
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,600
real health benefits that we kind of

2943
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:02,638
knew about that we kind of pushed

2944
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:03,760
and so it's a fascinating read but aside

2945
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:05,679
from the fact that something like you

2946
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,880
know your hydrogenated fats and your

2947
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:10,239
trans fats the

2948
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:11,679
the problem is that these fats are odd

2949
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:13,519
lengths like when you're taking a look

2950
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:17,039
at essential fatty acids

2951
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:18,960
you know they're you know 16 18 20 22

2952
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:19,840
carbon molecules strung together with

2953
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,239
different

2954
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,319
bends you know the omega-3 for example

2955
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:25,599
talks about you have a bend in the fat

2956
01:34:24,319 --> 01:34:26,719
if you think of it as a pipe cleaner

2957
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:29,120
there's a bend

2958
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:31,198
at you know the third carbon in you know

2959
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:33,359
where's an omega-6 it's the six carbon

2960
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:35,519
and so these hydrogenated fats

2961
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:36,479
have have these bends and these lengths

2962
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,000
that are just

2963
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:40,079
odd your system doesn't quite know what

2964
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,760
to do with it so i kind of liken it to

2965
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:43,519
gumming up the works

2966
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,880
so when you're putting these fats into

2967
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,719
your body suddenly you're getting this

2968
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,920
odd kind of you know your body's like

2969
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:49,279
what do i do with this and what do i

2970
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,719
make with it and so when we

2971
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:53,279
you know extend this to the thing of

2972
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:55,118
like hey omega-3 deficiencies have

2973
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:55,679
impacts on your endocannabinoid tone

2974
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:57,198
because

2975
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:58,880
some of the important endocannabinoids

2976
01:34:57,198 --> 01:35:00,238
are associated with those

2977
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,840
well if you start throwing more of these

2978
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:02,959
fats and they start to predominate in

2979
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:05,440
your system

2980
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:06,399
then that starts to become problematic

2981
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:08,638
you know

2982
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,238
sugars and things like that it's not so

2983
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:11,760
much i mean you know heaven forbid i you

2984
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:14,238
know i can be a bit of a chocoholic

2985
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,840
myself at times as well too you know so

2986
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:17,678
i think there's an important balance you

2987
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,960
know i kind of use the 80 20 rule you

2988
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,960
know 80 percent of the time

2989
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:23,600
20 percent of the time i enjoy stuff you

2990
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:25,118
know and you know i like a nice

2991
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:27,119
something tasty every once in a while so

2992
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:29,198
i try not to be too obsessive about it

2993
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:31,359
but you know as your health

2994
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:32,638
challenges mount up that becomes less

2995
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:35,198
and less over time

2996
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,719
but i think arguably you know some of

2997
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:38,399
the larger issues that we see

2998
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:40,079
in the context of health you know

2999
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:42,319
inflammation

3000
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:44,158
insulin blood glucose issues are there

3001
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:45,679
so carbohydrates start to become

3002
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:47,439
super important and really trying to

3003
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:49,039
making sure that we're getting our

3004
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:51,359
our carbohydrates that have a lot of

3005
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:53,039
fiber and the analogy that you use like

3006
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:54,880
a quick burning piece of newspaper and

3007
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:56,399
your fireplace burning a log

3008
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,880
you know there's a difference between a

3009
01:35:56,399 --> 01:36:00,079
steel cut oat versus oat flour which i

3010
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,560
equate to

3011
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:04,079
similar type of burn times you know so i

3012
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,199
think trying to get your carbs as

3013
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:07,760
unrefined as

3014
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:09,359
unprocessed as whole as possible is

3015
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,480
where i would be suggesting that way as

3016
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:12,399
well too to help

3017
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:14,158
limit those blood sugar swings and those

3018
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:15,519
insulin response and thereby

3019
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:17,198
you know probably being at the base of

3020
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,040
the pyramid

3021
01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:20,559
i think you're 80 20 you know it fits

3022
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:22,399
for so many things but in this

3023
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,880
case i think that most folks are

3024
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:25,439
probably 80 percent eating questionable

3025
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,000
food and

3026
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:29,439
20 eating healthy food but really

3027
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,079
remembering the 20

3028
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:32,638
that was good and so you know most folks

3029
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:35,118
seem to be

3030
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:35,679
kind of out of touch it's amazing the

3031
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:38,319
power

3032
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:39,920
of a food journal to really get to the

3033
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,319
bottom of what you're eating

3034
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,600
every single time in my life that i have

3035
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:45,840
done a food journal

3036
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,920
i have been shocked and disappointed in

3037
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,880
myself for what i'm actually eating in

3038
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,440
real life

3039
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,639
versus what i think i'm eating yeah and

3040
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:55,039
that's something i do with patients all

3041
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:57,520
the time i give a minimum of a two week

3042
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:58,639
diet diary with all of my patients and

3043
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,639
it's not so much you know

3044
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,239
and i i can do all sorts of different

3045
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,920
things i do like interventional pain

3046
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:06,959
management i can stick

3047
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,399
needles in people's backs and joints and

3048
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,639
things like that and they'd be like yeah

3049
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:11,118
and

3050
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:12,319
ask them to stop you know do a diet diet

3051
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:13,839
you'd think i was you know

3052
01:37:12,319 --> 01:37:16,319
trying to remove one of their limbs or

3053
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,279
something yeah so i mean it's it's

3054
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:18,559
challenging but i

3055
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:20,639
tell them it's like look this isn't

3056
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,239
really for me most patients usually

3057
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:23,359
after about a week or so start getting

3058
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:25,599
the general gist and they start

3059
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:27,519
modifying their diet all by themselves

3060
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,159
and really a sneaky little trick i do is

3061
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,480
i just keep on giving them

3062
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:33,759
all by themselves you dropped out there

3063
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:35,839
right there what was the thing

3064
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,760
what was the very last thing you said

3065
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,079
yeah usually i just give them

3066
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,679
diet diaries for three four weeks and

3067
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:42,319
they just start making changes all by

3068
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:44,079
themselves

3069
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:45,198
oh good you know i i don't even need to

3070
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:46,719
tell them anything they're like they

3071
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:48,079
know what they become so apparent

3072
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:51,198
themselves yeah

3073
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:51,840
yeah so corollary to the sugar of course

3074
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:55,279
is

3075
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:58,079
alcohol so um how will

3076
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:59,039
using alcohol like processed food

3077
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:02,158
degrade

3078
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:04,560
our endocannabinoid system yeah

3079
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:06,399
i think again alcohol there's a context

3080
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,239
to it i mean it depends on the type of

3081
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:10,638
alcohol and how much you're drinking i

3082
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:12,319
mean we've got the french paradox where

3083
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,079
you know a glass of red wine and things

3084
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:15,039
like that's not really too much of an

3085
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:16,000
issue and in fact

3086
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:17,519
you know there may be some health

3087
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,560
benefits because it helps you relax and

3088
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:21,199
unwind and

3089
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,960
and things like that as well too but

3090
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:26,638
some people again genetically have

3091
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:29,118
problems uh metabolizing alcohol

3092
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,159
and so that can be an issue and and

3093
01:38:29,118 --> 01:38:31,599
certainly we know

3094
01:38:30,158 --> 01:38:33,198
i mean my general experience and this

3095
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,719
comes from my environmental medicine

3096
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:38,158
stuff is that

3097
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:39,359
things like alcoholism and that there's

3098
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:40,238
there's some really interesting stuff

3099
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,880
that we saw around

3100
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:44,399
serotonin tryptophan metabolism and that

3101
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,760
in there so again there's that

3102
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:47,519
intersection so i don't i don't know

3103
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,039
exactly where it all in there and and

3104
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,800
but i do tell patients like look you

3105
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:52,238
know let's take a look at your alcohol

3106
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,119
consumption because again you could

3107
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:55,439
potentially

3108
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:56,880
you know limiting your resiliency

3109
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:57,439
resilient because you're starting to

3110
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,000
consume

3111
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:00,559
bandwidth in your endocannabinoid tone

3112
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,719
through these

3113
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,840
these disruptions and serotonin pathways

3114
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:06,079
and then there's also

3115
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,319
little metabolites that your body has to

3116
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:11,600
uh to clear out as well too

3117
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:13,599
i think that the next issue that starts

3118
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,119
to become problematic in that is that i

3119
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,920
find that a lot of stuff some a lot of

3120
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:18,479
patients have

3121
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:19,440
going to the gut microbiome like yeast

3122
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:21,279
issues

3123
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:23,839
and it's not uncommon to see patients

3124
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:26,880
have sort of sensitivity to yeasts

3125
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,440
uh in because of you know like you know

3126
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,560
particularly

3127
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:31,678
and no no disrespect to the craft beer

3128
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,400
industry but they tend to have a little

3129
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,000
bit more

3130
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:35,679
yeasty type stuff in there as well too

3131
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,039
so i see sometimes that's a problem so i

3132
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:39,039
tend to watch tell patients

3133
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:40,479
you know with a lot of gi issues to to

3134
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:42,000
watch out for for

3135
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:43,678
stuff with high yeast contents and

3136
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,520
whether that's craft beers or homemade

3137
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,039
wines or things like that so

3138
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,199
that's that's another option of it as

3139
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:51,600
well to get them to consider

3140
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:54,319
right um so so let's do a little summary

3141
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:56,880
here before we wrap up there chris so

3142
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:58,319
you know as we've already recognized we

3143
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,679
were a little

3144
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:01,439
i don't know we were kind of like

3145
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:02,719
shooting like shotgun pellets right kind

3146
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:06,000
of a little bit scattered

3147
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:09,198
but but we covered a wide

3148
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,560
breadth of so that hopefully we are able

3149
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:13,439
to provide

3150
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:15,760
new search terms and new i don't know

3151
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:17,279
paradigms new ideas new approaches

3152
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,760
mentally

3153
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:21,519
for both caregivers who are in taking a

3154
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:23,360
new patient and want to help them

3155
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:25,520
with their endocannabinoid system as

3156
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:27,519
well as self-directed

3157
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,800
uh you know cannabis enthusiasts who are

3158
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,320
trying to do it better

3159
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,880
and so you know there's kind of

3160
01:40:30,319 --> 01:40:35,679
something for everybody in this show but

3161
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:37,279
to kind of summarize it what are your

3162
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:39,520
i'm going to ask you for recommendations

3163
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:41,198
for two different kinds of listeners

3164
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,639
what would what is would be kind of your

3165
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:44,960
summary recommendation

3166
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:45,840
for someone coming to use cannabis

3167
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,639
medicine or

3168
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:49,760
food for health for the first time and

3169
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:51,920
then what are their

3170
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:52,800
recommendations for long-term cannabis

3171
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,760
users who

3172
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:58,079
already you know are using cannabinoids

3173
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:02,840
but they want to be more effective

3174
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:04,559
right so i as a clinician the thing that

3175
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:07,440
i as you probably

3176
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:08,480
got i like lots of information right and

3177
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:11,118
i think the

3178
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:12,718
the more we understand about you know

3179
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:14,719
what we're using and what we're dealing

3180
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:16,840
with that helps inform our decision

3181
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:18,719
making process and helps us make better

3182
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:20,400
decisions so

3183
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:21,920
you know for someone who's new to

3184
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:24,799
cannabis you know

3185
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:26,319
who's um you know where would i start

3186
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,600
you know again obviously

3187
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:30,238
you know we're taking a look at what's

3188
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:31,360
your overall health you know

3189
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:33,118
what is it that we're dealing with are

3190
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:34,559
you looking at inflammatory conditions

3191
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:37,839
are you looking at gut injuries

3192
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:39,600
so so get get your medical records get

3193
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:41,440
you know review what's going on here a

3194
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:43,600
little bit try and get a sense of

3195
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:44,799
okay you know what's my overall health

3196
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,880
looking like

3197
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,400
um and then dietary wise you know spend

3198
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,880
some time and and just do

3199
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:52,319
the basic nutritional stuff you know

3200
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,880
take a look at that you know clean up

3201
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:54,399
the diet

3202
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,079
you know get some exercise going

3203
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:57,198
optimize your potential these are these

3204
01:41:56,079 --> 01:41:59,039
are really

3205
01:41:57,198 --> 01:42:00,319
basic things you know and there's lots

3206
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,079
of different tools that are out there

3207
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:02,639
there's apps and fitness bits and things

3208
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:04,158
like that so

3209
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,400
i certainly encourage patients to do

3210
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:08,000
that um

3211
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:09,759
when it comes down to the cannabis

3212
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,920
itself which we

3213
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,760
we haven't really touched on yet but i

3214
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,600
think this is this answer just kind of

3215
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,360
goes into where i suggest

3216
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,360
both my more experienced cannabis

3217
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:21,118
patients which i would give the same

3218
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:23,359
recommendations to as the new patients

3219
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:26,719
but one from a cannabis standpoint

3220
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:28,559
is know what you're getting like

3221
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:30,000
i think the biggest issue that i see

3222
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,560
here

3223
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,399
is formulations and we don't know what's

3224
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,440
in it we don't know the ratios of your

3225
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:38,638
cbd

3226
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:40,638
your thc the terpene profiles you don't

3227
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:42,319
know how it's being extracted what's

3228
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:44,319
there with it as well too

3229
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:46,880
so you know know what's going into your

3230
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:47,920
bodies and if i were to summarize

3231
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,600
everything that we're talking about

3232
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,118
whether it's diet or whether it's

3233
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,560
cannabis it's like

3234
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:54,479
you know what you're doing get your

3235
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,080
information understand what it is that

3236
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:57,599

3237
01:42:56,079 --> 01:42:59,920
food what's in your food

3238

and get that and

3240
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,000
