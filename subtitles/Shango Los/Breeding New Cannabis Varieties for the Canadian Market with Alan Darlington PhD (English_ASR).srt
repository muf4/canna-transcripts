1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,099
so Alan thank you very much for taking

2
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,948
some of your valuable time to talking

3
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:21,059
with me today here at 7 acres so the

4
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,640
reason I wanted to talk to you is

5
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,618
because yesterday during the tour a lot

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,949
of the gross staff were telling me about

7
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,719
how limited you were with the genetics

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,219
that you were able to choose to grow

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:38,119
from here in Canada for now right and

10
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:40,679
your role here at 7 acres is is is

11
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,988
moving the company towards this new

12
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,350
Jeanette in house genetics concerned

13
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:49,558
called Cambrian and and you're gonna be

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,600
having to help develop the palette of

15
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,939
colors that your growers get to grow

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,308
with so let's start by talking a little

17
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,579
bit about the the state of play right

18
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:02,009
now in Canada and when what your

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,469
artificial bureaucratic limitations are

20
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:07,920
to what you can actually grow right in

21
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:10,679
Canada we are limited by what's legally

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,539
available we have a set of conditions

23
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:15,228
where we have to be able to buy our

24
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:19,049
genetics from an already licensed

25
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:22,519
producer so when Daisy Rose started

26
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,650
there wasn't a reservoir of

27
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,349
blackmarket interior became weightless

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,240
and we had to go looking for white

29
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:32,750
material so to speak and they were a

30
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:34,579
very small number of producers typically

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,280
overseas that we could get these scenes

32
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:39,560
from so everybody in Canada is basically

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,129
tapped into the same reservoir of

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,590
genetics and we've been trying to

35
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:47,420
optimize that ever since so just to give

36
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,600
folks an idea of how much you have

37
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:54,769
access to that's white that you know

38
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,689
meaning like legally accessible how many

39
00:01:54,769 --> 00:02:01,849
different chemo bars do you think ever

40
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:05,780
choose from tens of hundreds of so again

41
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:08,329
it's a very limited whereas the other

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,759
markets have again hundreds of strains

43
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,239
that they can choose from we are we are

44
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,250
down to tens it's very very limited and

45
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,920
and that really commoditized is the

46
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,199
product right if all of the LPS in

47
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,349
Canada are picking from this very small

48
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:27,139
candy bowl there's a lot of similarity

49
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:29,319
in products right yeah so you have you

50
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:31,729
have to really differentiate yourself on

51
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,139
the quality of the material because

52
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,109
everybody like you're saying is

53
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:38,958
generating roughly the same sort of

54
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:42,260
cultivars right on so so that of course

55
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,890
creates a situation where you want to

56
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:51,109
start breeding more in-house so that in

57
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:52,939
your role you can help the LPS that are

58
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,390
involved with seven acres and some

59
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:59,389
Freeman is the family be able to widen

60
00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:02,509
their their their their choices for

61
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:05,059
plants to grow and so would you tell me

62
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:07,129
a little bit about Cambrian and how that

63
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,659
is swarming sure yeah like a medium is

64
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:12,530
looking at just that it's that we're

65
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:15,379
looking at optimizing the genetics that

66
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,049
are available for use for licensed

67
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:20,250
producers well at the same time

68
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,170
optimizing the

69
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,090
environmental conditions we're trying to

70
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,369
optimize both the genetics and the

71
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,039
growing conditions for each of the

72
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,289
different situations what we're going to

73
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,069
be doing is we've gotten access to a

74
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:38,759
fairly large pool of genetics that we've

75
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,289
been working on curating and we're going

76
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,649
to be going through and final mining it

77
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:45,810
initially and selecting out strains and

78
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,650
then getting into more typical breeding

79
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,840
programs

80
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,310
phyto mining that's a new word for me I

81
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:57,509
like that that's great so this this this

82
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:01,199
this larger pool so is there going to be

83
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:02,819
a window where you can bring in new

84
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,069
genetics and so you'll be able to work

85
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,629
with those not just the small key there

86
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,250
is a window that's opening up in the

87
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:12,479
legislation that we can bring in

88
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:15,180
material and we so you're probably at

89
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,219
the point right now where you are you're

90
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,680
scanning the globe for the stuff you're

91
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,570
most excited and breed with and putting

92
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,400
it all on deck to bring it in during the

93
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:28,379
wind yes we are going to have a very

94
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:31,289
full shop so so what what what kind of

95
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:34,110
actions are you taking to identify those

96
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,669
genetics around the world I'm assuming

97
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,199
that you're talking to lots of breeders

98
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:39,149
and lots of people who've been doing

99
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,860
this in the heritage years yes yes and

100
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:43,668
what again that we're going through and

101
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,600
again taking advantage of what's

102
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:50,519
available and again we're not just

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,740
looking at what's happening and what's

104
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,939
going to fit today we're looking at it

105
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:00,030
as a very long term play is that

106
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,469
when we're looking at the cold furs were

107
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,729
bringing in that

108
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,940
be using the lottery

109
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,850
seven acres were regulating full-scale

110
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:13,089
large production but also looking at the

111
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,740
the next phase of the cannabis markets -

112
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:16,899
like optimizing for what's going to be

113
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,199
happening two years three years five

114
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:21,639
years down the line you know in the in

115
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,810
the states we've had a lot of challenges

116
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:28,509
with with people taking chemo bars that

117
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,660
they love outdoors and bringing them

118
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:33,279
indoors or as similarly people taking

119
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,910
chemo bars they love indoors and

120
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,919
bringing them outdoors and and you know

121
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,610
I live on Vashon Island in the Pacific

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,439
Northwest

123
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,300
and we constantly have challenges

124
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,310
because we love like a lot of the sexy

125
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,949
genetics here in California but a lot of

126
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,589
that outdoor stuff doesn't work when you

127
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:52,029
bring it and you do it on the Pacific

128
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:55,060
Northwest island where it starts to rain

129
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:57,549
the first week of October so for you you

130
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:03,280
are choosing genetics for a very

131
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:05,500
particular indoor environment that that

132
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,589
that also has glass up top so you are

133
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,930
also getting Sun so almost light

134
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:14,799
assisted greenhouse really feel entirely

135
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,660
greenhouse what are you looking for

136
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,250
what's your what's your what's your hit

137
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,500
list of what you're looking for in

138
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,899
genetics that you want to bring in that

139
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,670
you can that you can work you know at

140
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:29,139
seven acres we have a very specific

141
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:32,110
clone to dog we have a when we pump

142
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,909
through a lot of harvest in one

143
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,500
greenhouse and to do that sort of

144
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,260
scheduling on this sort of scale we have

145
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,100
to have plants that come to mature

146
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:43,599
maturation in a very set period of time

147
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,870
there are some very exciting things out

148
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,480
there that take 14 weeks to mature we

149
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,269
have a very set period of time in that

150
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,610
14 weeks just doesn't work for us so the

151
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:55,810
first thing when we're looking at

152
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,410
specifically here

153
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,540
is the timeframe for maturation within

154
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,060
that though one thing that I'm really

155
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,620
excited by is looking at how we can

156
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,750
adjust the environment the neat thing

157
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,350
with greenhouses is everything's up for

158
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,730
grabs

159
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,320
if you want more light you put more

160
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,470
light in if you want more water you put

161
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,540
water with whereas Northwest if it rains

162
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,980
today you get wet yeah there's nothing

163
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,140
you can do about it in the greenhouse

164
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,410
you can make it rain whenever you want

165
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,029
and to say you know if that one thing

166
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,600
I'm really excited by it's looking at

167
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:30,250
that like 14 week strain what can we do

168
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,910
with the environment to get it down to

169
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,829
fit our our timeline how can we change

170
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,320
the temperature regime how can we change

171
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:40,120
the light to make these ones that

172
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,159
otherwise wouldn't be fitting in our

173
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,319
system fit so it's a really

174
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,150
hybridization of the genetics and the

175
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,459
production that makes them work here

176
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,750
that's interesting you I when I was

177
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:51,039
listening your answer I thought I knew

178
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,810
where you were going that you were

179
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,960
you're going to take these 14 weekers

180
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,089
and then cross them too much shorter

181
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,349
finishers and then you end up you know

182
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:00,789
somewhere in the middle and then you

183
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,010
find a phyno in there that's especially

184
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,050
short and there you go and there's

185
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,889
probably going to be some of that but

186
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:12,460
the idea that you want to coax the bloom

187
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:15,189
cycle to shorten by the environment that

188
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:18,310
would that was a surprise so that must

189
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:20,259
involve a lot of data collection yeah do

190
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,280
you explain that a little bit data is

191
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:25,870
your friend that's again one of the

192
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,000
things I was very excited when I started

193
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:32,349
it was just the how rigorous they keep

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,908
track of numbers here both going ahead

195
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,770
like looking at well what happened if we

196
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:37,509
did this but looking at the records how

197
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:40,509
you can adjust and see what's happening

198
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:42,718
with the various crops you know when

199
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:45,639
you're saying about you know looking at

200
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,800
adjusting the genetics to fit that is a

201
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:53,580
long term but because cannabis is really

202
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:56,519
a new crop there's so much that we can

203
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,600
learn with what we already have before

204
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,419
we have to get in there and start

205
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,379
adjusting the genetics I always use the

206
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:08,579
example of the Agricultural Revolution

207
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:10,169
with time money and genetics and

208
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,050
production they've been able to almost

209
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:16,159
double production every 10 15 years for

210
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:19,620
corn for the last 30 40 years with

211
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,120
cannabis because it was illicit for so

212
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,509
long it hasn't been able to take

213
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,519
advantage of that now in the opportunity

214
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:28,528
we have we can that we can do catch-up

215
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,870
we can apply all we know about genetics

216
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:33,230
all we know about production to get

217
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,580
cannabis up to the level of like other

218
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,470
agricultural crops in a very short

219
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,160
period of time you know it's it's

220
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,200
interesting because you say that that

221
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,370
cannabis is a new crop right and I know

222
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200
that like there's a whole bunch of

223
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,820
heritage growers that a cringe when you

224
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,190
hear this because you know people are

225
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,370
going back to you know Revolutionary era

226
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,620
hemp and then and then the the cannabis

227
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,778
landraces coming in during the 70s and

228
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,879
80s from you know Thailand Mexico and

229
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:02,909
all that and then and then you know

230
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,278
modern-day the u.s. is producing some of

231
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:06,838
the the best genetics that have ever

232
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,570
been in cannabis and we've all been

233
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,260
doing this from the start and yet we

234
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,600
have not had access to the materials

235
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:17,539
that you've had you know with

236
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,220
ornamentals and other types of plants

237
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:22,319
for generations right suddenly we've got

238
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,180
we've got analytics and we don't have to

239
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,970
hide so we can spread out our space and

240
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:29,370
we can have multiple grow rooms and and

241
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:33,420
then all of this fantastic technology to

242
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:35,370
take data about the plants at its grows

243
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:38,699
so you know we all get that it's like a

244
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:45,240
great brave new world right are you

245
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:48,329
finding that the the pace of development

246
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,930
and I'm not talking about GMO here we're

247
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:53,849
talking about traditional hybridization

248
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:57,179
how much more quickly do you think that

249
00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:00,209
that that development of cycle increases

250
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:02,278
now that you've got

251
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,808
access to these types of materials yeah

252
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,610
there's all the sudden we can take

253
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:09,028
advantage of everything and everybody

254
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,879
know for years it was an evil just to

255
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:13,350
step back what you're saying about the

256
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,740
heritage side of it is one of the

257
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:19,889
standards we always use is can we scale

258
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,129
produce what that guy and without one or

259
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:24,720
two plants can do alone so we're still

260
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:27,209
using the her acute desire as our

261
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,699
threshold and to do it at scale of that

262
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:32,099
quality and quantity is really the thing

263
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:34,948
so so recognizing the great work that

264
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,980
everybody's done so far but being able

265
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:41,938
to institutionalize it to make it a

266
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:45,379
production component so the second one

267
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:48,778
is is that we were saying about you know

268
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:50,249
using the what making it jump ahead

269
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,438
there's all the sudden we can go to

270
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:54,689
university and say you've got a genetics

271
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:56,519
department can we buy some of your

272
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:58,769
professors time to work on this project

273
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,350
can we work with you on these sort of

274
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:04,049
things we can go to a major financial

275
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,730
institute in this aching can we work out

276
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:08,578
a relationship where you can help us

277
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,509
fund this sort of work it's it's really

278
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:15,479
the it's been a slow burn like a nice

279
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:19,230
warm coal fire yeah we're throwing

280
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,959
gasoline on it I find it interesting

281
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:26,039
because I like that you gave the nod to

282
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:29,068
the quality of bosch small batch craft

283
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:33,748
artisan flours and that your benchmark

284
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:37,259
is to try to meet that fidelity but then

285
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:40,290
also instead of having it in you know 25

286
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,119
plants that are all you know hand taken

287
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:45,568
care of in somebody's basement you're

288
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:48,778
doing these huge grow rooms of it at

289
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:52,649
that point the analytics and the

290
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:55,889
automation that you can fine-tune you

291
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,879
know become necessary because it was

292
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:59,448
interesting when I did the tour

293
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,909
yesterday I kept on seeing all these

294
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:04,740
really thoughtful automated solutions

295
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:08,490
and we had a little conversation with

296
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:12,028
the staff about the the classic phrase

297
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,970
the best fertilizer is the shadow of the

298
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:14,559
farmer

299
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,740
and my question was with all this

300
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,019
automation it's less time that the

301
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,169
individual growers need to spend with

302
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:25,419
each plant and and then and then the

303
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,309
Madi one of your one of your lis growers

304
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:30,459
he's all like he says but we're always

305
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:32,769
looking for ways to add additional touch

306
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,360
yes and and I didn't really understand

307
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,120
that and he explained to me that it's

308
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,879
about we want to automate so all the

309
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,879
plants are getting the same love which

310
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:45,129
frees up his time to spend more time

311
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,269
with the individuated place and see what

312
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:47,919
else they need yeah

313
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,350
and I thought that was pretty elegant

314
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,059
because I'm pretty staunch that that we

315
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,350
don't hand watering his fan is is a

316
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:57,099
great thing because you spend a little

317
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,860
bit of time with each plant and but then

318
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,440
when I see it rolled out at scale we're

319
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,330
okay they're automatically all gonna get

320
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,340
watered the same and treated the same

321
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:09,009
and he did the same in the same airflow

322
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,160
and these fantastic air Sox that are

323
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:16,600
underneath the tables making the the

324
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:22,439
room very uniform and that frees up the

325
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:25,629
staff to give other sorts of care and I

326
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,490
was surprisingly convinced right I'm not

327
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:30,759
that's not you you know scaling is not

328
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,560
usually where I come down but the proof

329
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,289
was in the pudding the plants looked

330
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:38,469
fantastic they were thriving there was

331
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:40,240
zero pest pressure and and they smelled

332
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,100
good and then you know afterwards I got

333
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,440
to try it and they tasted fantastic as

334
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,730
well so bringing this all the way back

335
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:52,270
to your idea of breeding for does these

336
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,279
environments is that the target

337
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:56,049
environment that you're breeding for and

338
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:57,610
what does that what kind of freedoms

339
00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:00,639
that does that allow you when you're

340
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:05,230
breeding for than that yeah cozy

341
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,029
environment is the take it yes that's

342
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,039
that's one of the environments like we

343
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,490
are looking at this big picture like we

344
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,649
are looking at this production

345
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,009
greenhouse at scale and we're also

346
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:20,970
looking at the next phase which will be

347
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:23,100
might be growing in fields here no so we

348
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,899
are looking at the whole spectrum we're

349
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,940
starting with the greenhouse because

350
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,980
that's where we're from and that's what

351
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,040
we know what we're also looking at the

352
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,000
big picture but the the freedom it's

353
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:38,939
just like you're saying is that we can

354
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,139
get to the point where every bud is

355
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,089
exactly like the other one and we know

356
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,759
everybody knows that you know we up and

357
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,800
down the same plant the quality changes

358
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,200
from one plant to the next quality

359
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:57,120
changes and if you're really talking

360
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,740
about that premium quality product the

361
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,440
guy who buys it wants that the person

362
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,560
who buys it wants to know that they are

363
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,390
getting the exact same thing every time

364
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:10,079
if this time it's a dud and next thing

365
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:11,759
that's a head sort of thing you know

366
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,110
you're going to be cautious but if you

367
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,208
know exactly what you're getting each

368
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,399
time and that's where we can actually

369
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:20,879
start looking at saying well what do we

370
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,289
want the quality the consumer what does

371
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,939
the consumer want rather than saying

372
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:26,129
what we're going to give them what do

373
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,649
they want from us we can start looking

374
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:31,169
at environments that changed the Turcan

375
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:34,230
weight profiles is that if you give the

376
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:37,139
water at this time of day what does it

377
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,759
do to the lemon levels if you give this

378
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:42,230
quality of life what does it do the

379
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:45,419
Piney and all those sort of fine-tuning

380
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:48,870
you versus commented on the the

381
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:52,620
automation and that automation sounds

382
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:58,049
like you're dehumanizing it I look at it

383
00:16:52,620 --> 00:17:00,179
as a palette of like painting is that if

384
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:01,979
you have to mix every paint color and

385
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:03,929
set them up yourself you're going to be

386
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,930
spending all your time doing that you're

387
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:09,359
doing any of the artwork if the computer

388
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:11,880
supplies all the different colors that

389
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,649
you can add and change you can actually

390
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,890
do some pretty fantastic painting with

391
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:20,460
that palette the changing of light

392
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:23,190
quality quantity can all do that so to

393
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:27,088
maximize the potential of all the

394
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:29,279
genetics we develop we can optimize the

395
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,029
the environment to fit that particular

396
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,569
plant

397
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:35,099
I like that example that's great so so I

398
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:36,990
know that you are busy building a

399
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,549
cambium so I'll let you go but thank you

400
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,390
very much for your time I appreciate it

401
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:41,690
all right thanks a lot

402
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,690
Thanks
