2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,120
farming has always been a risky business

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,959
interacting with nature is fraught with

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,279
potential dangers leading to crop

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,359
failure some of them like deer or even

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,719
spider mites you can see and do your

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,160
best to prevent

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,839
some threats though are nearly

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,920
undetectable and will decimate your

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,278
plant before you even know it is there

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,439
today we're going to talk about some of

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,800
those unseen threats

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,240
if you want to learn about cannabis

is a phd candidate in plant science at

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,400
the university of connecticut her

49
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,319
research focuses on the association

50
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,118
between microbial communities and

51
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,959
pathogens causing root rot she holds a

52
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,560
degree in horticulture and a master's in

53
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,158
plant science

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,118
during the first set we will talk about

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,719
fusarium wilt its causes and prevention

56
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,799
during the second set we'll do the same

57
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,959
thing with pythium and in set three

58
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,840
we'll cover proper tool cleaning a bit

59
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,759
on root rock in rockwool systems and the

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,159
importance of microscopes

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,640
welcome to the show cora

62
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,560
happy to be here fantastic so let's jump

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,199
right into it you know one of the things

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,598
that caught me off guard right away

65
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,878
when doing my advanced research on this

66
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:19,919
show about fusarium and pythium molds is

67
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,679
that pythium actually isn't a mold which

68
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,519
caught me off guard because we certainly

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,200
talk about it as one

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,520
um but i understand there's some

71
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,519
taxonomic discussion about whether it

72
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
really is a mold and it seems that

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,200
they've even created an entirely new

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,239
kingdom for it which for me seems to be

75
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,479
like a pretty big deal um so would you

76
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,439
hit on that a bit before we go into

77
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,119
pythium's characteristics um that matter

78
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,800
to us as cultivators

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,560
yes of course it's a really good

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
question so you know it's brought up a

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,280
lot because we tend to group pythium

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,319
with all the rest of the fungal diseases

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,400
because

84
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,598
it's very similar in the way that it

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
grows and

86
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:04,318
and by and other types of um infection

87
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,480
but the biggest difference is that you

88
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,958
know true fungi have chitin and their

89
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,119
cell wall and in pythium a different oh

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,199
my seeds is what we categorize pythium

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,640
in uh they don't so they lack chitin in

92
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,399
their cell wall and that's that's a big

93
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,559
difference when we're talking about

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,039
characteristics of fungi

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,158
uh and it's funny because yeah pythium's

96
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,239
not a mold but we tend to categorize it

97
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,079
as a water mold because it thrives in

98
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,080
water it loves water

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,599
so it's kind of an informal way that

100
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,760
even plant pathologists talk about

101
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,000
pythium but when you talk about

102
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,560
classification no it's it's not a true

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,280
fungi it's an oh my seed and you could

104
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,039
even think of it as a um it's a protist

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,719
but you know if you grow it in culture

106
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,359
it it's still got hyphy and it grows

107
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,318
very similar if you see it uh

108
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,720
the mold anywhere on a plant you know it

109
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,318
really does look like a fungus but you

110
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,878
know being

111
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,438
being technical when we talk about it

112
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,239
it's not so they're in their own little

113
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,318
world and category of the oh my seats uh

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,319
and not the true fungi so

115
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,238
yeah do do we find that that happens

116
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,958
like to have them re-categorized

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,680
taxonomically is kind of common my only

118
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,840
experience with it is um you know i i

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
kept aquariums for years and

120
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,759
occasionally we'd get one of these uh

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,759
you know small schooling fish or

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,680
something where they would change the

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,520
name of it from what we knew to a new

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,079
one because they're like oh yeah we we

125
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,758
moved we moved where it was on the

126
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,918
species chart and i always thought that

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,160
was such a i don't know kind of cool and

128
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,560
odd thing to have happen um i know that

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,439
you study a lot of these

130
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,319
i don't know i guess i'll call

131
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,639
microorganisms um are you finding that

132
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,399
that these things like jump around on

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,040
the chart regularly

134
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,478
yes yeah and it's funny like most plant

135
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,919
pathologists you know it's kind of

136
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,839
annoying because

137
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,319
we'll call something

138
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,079
uh their scientific name or latin name

139
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,719
for years and years and you know someone

140
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,198
who studies even a pathogen uh you know

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,759
it's got the same genus and species and

142
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,680
when it changes on you then you know the

143
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,280
the correct way is to call it by its

144
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,959
proper name even though like you know

145
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,478
you know it is the name that you've been

146
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,959
calling it for years and i have a really

147
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,758
good example of epithelium that i worked

148
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,638
a lot with and then all of a sudden 2014

149
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,080
the

150
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,759
uh the genus of the pythium change so

151
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,599
it's not even pythium anymore we call it

152
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,080
globus burangium

153
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,439
which is like a much longer name uh for

154
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,800
pithium irregular is the is the species

155
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,000
that i'm talking about so instead of

156
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,840
being pithium irregular it's

157
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,160
globosporangium irregular so that's a

158
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,758
really good example and i attribute it

159
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,120
um

160
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,560
more commonly the more we learn about

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,319
these organisms uh i think sequencing

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,199
and molecular technologies have really

163
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,279
helped uh correctly classify them and

164
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
keep classifying them and it's not just

165
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,679
microorganisms

166
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,318
uh

167
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,160
tree species and um and you know even

168
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,080
woody ornamentals go through this as

169
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,520
well uh and there's a whole board it's

170
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,439
it's actually a whole

171
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,000
formal process of people getting

172
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,000
together and trying to figure out uh how

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
to reclassify and

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,120
and it can turn into a headache but you

175
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,960
know you just go with the flow yeah

176
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,840
right and then you accept its new name

177
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,638
and and and keep going with it uh but

178
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,959
i can imagine that it um it does

179
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,960
separate the old-school scientists from

180
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,478
the new folks coming up because some

181
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,879
people know the old name and some people

182
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,800
knew the new name but let's let's let's

183
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,240
uh cycle around and focus on cannabis

184
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:37,038
now so um is there just one

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,918
species of pithium that is of concern to

186
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,199
cannabis cultivators or or are there a

187
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:42,799
variety of them because i mean i know

188
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,120
there's a lot of different pythium

189
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,280
varieties but i don't know if all of

190
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,199
them are concerned to we cannabis lovers

191
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,799
yeah that's a good question so

192
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,680
of course you know as cannabis is

193
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,680
becoming a way more popular crop and

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,519
we're still learning a lot about what

195
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,680
types of pythiums that we're finding

196
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,120
within infected plants and infected

197
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,720
substrates

198
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,199
or soil that people are growing the

199
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,479
cannabis in and my personal experience

200
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,520
i'll start

201
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:14,079
with i've personally isolated pithium

202
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,959
myriatylum

203
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,918
from

204
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,799
infected cannabis plants and uh have

205
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,399
also

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,280
extracted well i was just talking about

207
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,758
pythium uh a regular but it's really

208
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,918
globus ferangium irregular but you know

209
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,360
you they look very similar and you can

210
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,359
still think of it as a pythium even

211
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
though the genus name has changed so

212
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,680
i've identified um

213
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,160
both of those at a commercial marijuana

214
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,800
facility uh within infected infected

215
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,039
plants however uh going into the

216
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
literature there's a lot of reports not

217
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,918
just from one state

218
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,560
but multiple states in which they're

219
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,639
finding pithium affinitum

220
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,639
within cannabis production whether it's

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,840
marijuana or hemp we're seeing that you

222
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,960
know it doesn't really matter the

223
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,719
difference

224
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,560
uh you know cannabis is cannabis uh so

225
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,280
so yeah those are the three main

226
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,959
pythiums that i have

227
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,598
that i've been seeing not just in

228
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,318
literature but in my own experience and

229
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:13,038
out of all three of them pithy amerio

230
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,280
tylem seems to be the most virulent um

231
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,120
which means basically causing the most

232
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,719
damage and the most symptoms within the

233
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,038
plants uh

234
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,440
and and and it's not just mature plants

235
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,918
that you can see these pythiums and uh

236
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,439
pythium you have to actually look for

237
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,560
throughout the whole production stage

238
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,479
because uh pythium is also known for

239
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,038
attacking really young seedlings as well

240
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,278
they're very susceptible uh that classic

241
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,120
kind of wilt damping off symptom is is

242
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,679
pretty classic of pythium so something

243
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,000
to look out for not just within mature

244
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,239
plants and in the soil of those plants

245
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,679
but also um within the seedling

246
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,519
production as well

247
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:54,719
so does um

248
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,759
does pithium live in all soil or let me

249
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
here let me ask this question

250
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,439
differently you know very often cannabis

251
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,159
um

252
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,160
cultivators are are thinking about

253
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:08,000
keeping their

254
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,360
plants sterile from these pathogens

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
which you know

256
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,320
since since we mostly talk about living

257
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,040
soil on this show of course keeping a

258
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,000
living soil pot somehow sterile is kind

259
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,319
of an oxymoron but but people kind of

260
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,159
think of like i don't want any pithium

261
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,760
in my garden so i'm going to guard

262
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:30,480
against having any pythium and i suspect

263
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,278
that pythium is probably in every single

264
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,480
pot but the question is is we want to

265
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:39,919
keep our pot in balance so that it

266
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,399
doesn't fall out of balance and and

267
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,360
create a living environment that lets

268
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,360
the

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,879
pythium out compete

270
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,680
like i don't know whoever it competes

271
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,600
against and so so what what is that what

272
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,519
is that like is it is it pretty sure

273
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
that pythium's already present

274
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,799
everywhere and it's just about keeping

275
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,039
it in check

276
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,399
right so so that's a question that i've

277
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,319
actually asked a lot like where is it

278
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,839
coming from it seems to be everywhere

279
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,839
and and so now um you know myself and

280
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,279
other uh extension agents and i'm sure

281
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,440
pathologists have kind of gotten to the

282
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,519
point where now we tell growers just

283
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,160
imagine that pythium's always there it's

284
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
pretty ubiquitous it can be found

285
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,159
in lots of different uh growing

286
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,720
operations lots of different hosts and

287
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,199
that doesn't exclude cannabis so i would

288
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
say yeah just um just keep in mind that

289
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,759
it may always be there no matter you

290
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,078
know you should keep you know doing your

291
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,399
practices keeping everything clean and

292
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,599
and and trying to keep

293
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,078
um

294
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,639
everything sanitized however

295
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,278
i always say it really comes down to not

296
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,439
creating conducive conditions for the

297
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,000
pythium to be very happy and like you

298
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,320
said really out compete all those other

299
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,159
microorganisms that may be antagonistic

300
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,040
to the pythium that's in that living

301
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,719
soil um which brings us to the crux of

302
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,559
all this right let's go right let's go

303
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,720
right to it what are

304
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,199
the living conditions that create this

305
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,160
opportunity of imbalance and and gives

306
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,839
pythium a chance to take over our pot

307
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,360
so the biggest one that i really want to

308
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,320
bring up and we kind of hinted on it

309
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,560
earlier

310
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,360
is uh pythium loves water

311
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:18,078
it it can infect really easily in water

312
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,839
and so waterlogged soil conditions

313
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,799
really creates this awesome environment

314
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:26,320
for pythium to take off uh so

315
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:29,039
so any time that you're not um managing

316
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,600
your soil moisture properly and and your

317
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,278
soil moisture is is too saturated and

318
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,680
you're really waterlogging your soils

319
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,078
because that not only creates you know

320
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,359
less oxygen getting to the roots and a

321
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,599
really you know kind of stressed out

322
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,159
unhappy root zone within the plant it's

323
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,079
also making this pythium very happy

324
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,838
because it's got infecting tropicals

325
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,919
called zoospores

326
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,399
that are very efficient in swimming in

327
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,159
solution and they'll swim right into

328
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,159
your roots

329
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,399
and another thing that makes pythium

330
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,719
really happy is high nitrogen levels and

331
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,720
excess fertilizer uh because that can

332
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,440
really break your um

333
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,839
root cells open and then the pythium is

334
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,000
very efficient it's swimming and going

335
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,920
towards your roots and affecting them

336
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,879
that way see so you really want to

337
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,559
create a healthy and happy root zone to

338
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,240
stop that pythium from coming in in the

339
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,599
first place so again it's like always

340
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
act like the pythium is going to be

341
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,839
there in the pot with you but don't

342
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,800
don't allow those conditions that make

343
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,320
pythium thrive within that pot let's

344
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,639
let's talk about the mechanics of that

345
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,800
really specifically because cannabis

346
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,720
cultivators are an ingenious lot and

347
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,319
they are always looking for their own

348
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,639
solutions so let's talk about this

349
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
mechanic so the way that you said it was

350
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,440
that you don't want to have too much

351
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,239
moisture in the pot because the pythium

352
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,560
will swim towards the roots and infect

353
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,120
that way like there's got to be more to

354
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:54,239
it right because like the the i imagine

355
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,039
the root actually has got a membrane of

356
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,159
some sort on the outside how does the

357
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,278
water

358
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:03,759
create an opportunity for the pythium to

359
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,600
air quote swim into the roots

360
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,278
well it's not just the water it's the

361
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,959
water um

362
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,159
that too much water is having an effect

363
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:14,958
on the roots so roots also need oxygen

364
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:17,679
to survive just as we do so if you're

365
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,759
not allowing adequate oxygen to get to

366
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,919
the roots and always having too much

367
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,439
water bound around those roots then

368
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,879
you're already kind of creating an

369
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,760
effect where you're rotting out your

370
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,480
roots and then that that's where pythium

371
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,240
can really take the opportunity uh to

372
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
come into the roots

373
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,839
so you're saying like the the the root

374
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,559
is wet and so the root starts to

375
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,440
like literally rot and so there are like

376
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,759
fissures in the roots

377
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,839
well yeah if that if that root cell

378
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,278
burst open it'll it'll start leaking out

379
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,000
we call it leaky roots they'll start

380
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,720
leaking out root exudates and that

381
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,360
and um zoospores can can sense that and

382
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,959
swim via in the root chemiotaxis via

383
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,039
chemotaxis can get into the root um so

384
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,559
so that's why i also mentioned not just

385
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,719
water log conditions that are not

386
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,119
allowing adequate oxygen within the root

387
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,278
zone but also excess fertilizer can also

388
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,600
like high salt concentration within your

389
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,519
growing operation can also really affect

390
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
those roots stress them out break them

391
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,839
open kind of like cause some root

392
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,240
necrosis root damage especially at the

393
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,639
tip level and then again you're just

394
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,560
allowing this entry point uh for the

395
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
pythium to get through really easily

396
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,000
that's right i've never heard an

397
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,078
explanation for what what i'm thinking

398
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,278
we all refer to is root burn then people

399
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:34,239
say oh you don't use

400
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,958
don't want to use too many fruits

401
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,039
because you'll burn your roots i bet you

402
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,838
this is what we're all referring to when

403
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,679
we use that common parlance

404
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,959
yeah yeah i guess we call it leaky roots

405
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,799
because like they're leaking out those

406
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,479
root exudates that's making you know all

407
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,479
these plant pathogens are waking up and

408
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,720
being like oh yeah we have an entryway

409
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,199
now and and and then once they get into

410
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,800
that tissue then you know they they

411
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,719
really have something to feed on and

412
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,278
they start multiplying your populations

413
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,600
just get get higher you know they have

414
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,159
now they have a host so so they can

415
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,120
survive efficiently uh

416
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,879
dormant and not need a host uh within

417
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,078
soils and things like that but they can

418
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,159
really take off and increase the

419
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,078
population when they have that host and

420
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,439
those those tasty roots to feed on i

421
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,039
guess if you want to think about it like

422
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,160
that so really it's not that pythium

423
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,039
it's not that pythium has come in

424
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,719
and

425
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,000
um attacked your plant as much it is it

426
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,278
is

427
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,159
that the cultivator has over watered its

428
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,559
plant or doesn't have enough drainage

429
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,679
for long enough that the roots are

430
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,958
rotting

431
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:46,399
and that the smell of the exudates if

432
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:50,559
you will like wakes up the pythium and

433
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,440
it it goes into the root via those those

434
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,919
cracks in the root structure and so

435
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,680
the the pythium is just gonna sit there

436
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,599
and be

437
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,958
um dormant thank you dorman i was gonna

438
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
say hibernation i'm like that's not

439
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,559
right pretty much it's a good way to put

440
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,958
it yes like hanging out yeah it's just

441
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,919
hanging out right so that's interesting

442
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,559
so we really can't like blame pythium

443
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:15,439
really like it's like we're creating

444
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,518
this attractive nuisance essentially

445
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
yeah yeah what over watering and over

446
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,360
fertilizing like though

447
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,958
they really really do not help and they

448
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,879
really help and they don't help the

449
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,119
grower but they help invite the pythium

450
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,519
uh to infect so those are the two huge

451
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,039
things with the root rots um that

452
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,278
you know pathologists really can't

453
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,719
stress enough uh because you can stay as

454
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,399
clean as you want but you know those

455
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,360
root zone conditions you want white

456
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,078
plump roots uh so so anytime those are

457
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,600
compromised you you are kind of you know

458
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:47,198
alluring all these

459
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,240
uh especially pithium uh diseases to

460
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,319
to come into the roots yeah so um you

461
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,600
know

462
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,079
for both pythium and fusarium the main

463
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,720
way that most cultivators recognize that

464
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,799
there's a problem is because they get

465
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,679
what you know people call either

466
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,558
fusarium wilt or pythium wilt where the

467
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,000
plant droops in a very severe way that

468
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:15,119
looks unlike a regular wilt when they

469
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
get thirsty right um this somehow looks

470
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,000
more dramatic

471
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,480
um

472
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,400
and you know once you've seen it a

473
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,240
couple times it's really you don't

474
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,000
really confuse them anymore

475
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,359
but um but is there are there other ways

476
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,240
that um

477
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,959
we can find signs to determine if we

478
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,880
have pithium like before it takes the

479
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,519
plant are there are there other signs

480
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,919
that we can look for

481
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,319
yes and and that's a that's a good way

482
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,480
to we always say you know scout early so

483
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,678
so i'll go back to my previous statement

484
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,240
um

485
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,240
you want to really start with inspecting

486
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,599
all the healthy material coming and all

487
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,599
the material and making sure it's

488
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,759
healthy when it comes into the facility

489
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,199
or coming into your yard what have you

490
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,400
like wherever you're growing your plants

491
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,240
make sure those are healthy and that

492
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,320
you're not starting off with

493
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,919
like any rotted plants things like that

494
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,079
and if we're talking about like a you

495
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,000
know more mature potted plant and what

496
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,720
are signs that you can look for

497
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,319
it'll it starts in the roots so

498
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
so once you get that wilt and that

499
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,319
dramatic droop like that there really

500
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,160
isn't going back or saving that plant

501
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,079
which which i hate to say but it's all

502
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,640
about prevention so once you get to that

503
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,519
level of you're getting the will then

504
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,038
then then it's a goner but

505
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,400
since it starts in the roots and it

506
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,798
you'll you'll start getting kind of

507
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,720
brown uh necrotic roots that's the first

508
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,359
step and something that's telltale about

509
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,120
pythium that's not so much for fusarium

510
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,519
is that with pythium it's called a rat

511
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,119
tail so you can like if you see that

512
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,798
your roots are looking kind of necrotic

513
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,359
or browning is it going to put just kind

514
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,359
of like dead not healthy white roots you

515
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,759
can take some of that root tissue pull

516
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,558
it apart and if the outer cortex or just

517
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,558
like

518
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,038
um the outer membrane however you want

519
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:00,000
to say it of that root comes off so

520
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,200
easily and exposes that internal

521
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,798
um

522
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,880
that intervascular

523
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,519
tissue within the root uh the inner

524
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,120
cortex uh we call that rat tail that's

525
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,960
pretty telltale pythium if it just

526
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,558
easily sloughs off right when you like

527
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,400
break that root apart

528
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,759
uh that's a that's a good tell that you

529
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
have pythium brew right and hopefully

530
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,679
you can catch that before you start

531
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
getting the wilt symptoms uh and then

532
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,519
another

533
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,160
characteristic sign is reduced growth so

534
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,400
this is a big one because uh you know

535
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,000
say you've got six plants on a table and

536
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,960
you're seeing you know they you want to

537
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
look for uniformity and uh and if

538
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,000
there's some plants that are just

539
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,640
looking like really smaller you're like

540
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,240
i bought these like around the same time

541
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
things are looking you know more reduced

542
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,359
growth they should be probably bigger

543
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,399
with how much you've been fertilized and

544
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,519
you're watering you're like man that's

545
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,000
weird i just feel like they're growing

546
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,000
really slow uh that's another telltale

547
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,079
sign that you've got a root rot issue

548
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,679
because it's just that plant its roots

549
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,678
are compromised so it's just not growing

550
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
as vigorously as it should be if it had

551
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,919
white healthy roots uh and then another

552
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
symptom that you can see within both you

553
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,320
know fusarium and pythium is yellowing

554
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,240
of leaves so you can see we like to call

555
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,759
it chlorosis chlorotic leaves

556
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,839
yellowing's the same

557
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,919
uh and and that's a big symptom as well

558
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,119
so so before you even get to the wilt

559
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,280
stage because the will it's like the

560
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,119
final you know the the the roots have

561
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,440
been totally compromised and that that

562
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,879
pathogen just totally took over and and

563
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,558
it's done

564
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,360
those are three big ones to really look

565
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,038
for and it starts with the roots so

566
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,879
so you really just want to be checking

567
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,319
making sure like you have white healthy

568
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,559
roots it's very exciting when you can

569
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,079
like you know kind of pull the pot back

570
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:35,839
and see like yeah i have white roots

571
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,678
like and it's it's kind of root bound

572
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,119
too like they're you know they're grow

573
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,798
there's a lot of them but when you're

574
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,079
not seeing many roots within your root

575
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,079
ball and when you're seeing that the

576
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,240
roots are turning brown that's a good

577
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,399
sign that you should maybe bring that

578
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,079
plant out of production

579
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,919
so that your other plants don't get

580
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,038
infected as well and that you're not

581
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,159
spreading

582
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,400
um that infection you know that's a you

583
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,280
know i have heard

584
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,440
that people pull small plants i mean i

585
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,879
even pull small plants just because

586
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,159
they don't look they are like they're

587
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,240
going to yield enough to justify their

588
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,159
space in the greenhouse

589
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,038
but i had never really thought about it

590
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:20,480
as the runts might just not be um you

591
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,720
know seeds with finos that are not as

592
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,079
rambunctious but they actually could be

593
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,400
sick i mean that

594
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,759
you know making a decision to get rid of

595
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,640
a runt based on yield is um you know is

596
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,319
a lot more of a passive decision than

597
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,679
potentially getting rid of a runt

598
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:40,079
because it's a very good sign of you

599
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,519
know root rot um that kind that seems

600
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,519
like it's way more pressing than you

601
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,639
know than just yield

602
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,639
yeah yeah

603
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,000
and and and you know if you really don't

604
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,280
want to get rid of that brunt like say

605
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,279
like oh well i could get something out

606
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,798
of it again just check those roots

607
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,798
because like that that'll tell you

608
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,240
really quick is my plant happy and

609
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:57,599
healthy and are the roots thriving

610
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,120
because if they're not then it's a

611
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,879
really good sign you know yeah i have

612
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,879
root rot like that's why this plant's

613
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,559
not doing well it's because not enough

614
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,000
water and nutrients are getting uptaken

615
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,000
through these necrotic you know these

616
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,159
browning roots it's calm you know it's

617
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,359
compromising it's it's the plants really

618
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,640
struggling

619
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,759
to to to get to high yield so right on

620
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
let's talk a little bit about the best

621
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:21,359
practices of that so as i'm picturing

622
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,679
you know looking at my roots first thing

623
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:29,199
you know a lot of a lot of folks grow in

624
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:32,000
um you know huge cloth pots you know of

625
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,000
hundreds of gallons and clearly you're

626
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,079
not gonna like flip that over in your

627
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,599
palm and and knock out the plant into

628
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,599
your hands so you can look at the roots

629
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,599
so if you're if you're growing in in

630
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,959
huge pots that probably

631
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,759
um isn't for this solution and also if

632
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,480
you're growing in um you know generally

633
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,798
fabric pots they don't really slide out

634
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,480
as elegantly as they do when you're

635
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:59,038
using a black plastic landscape pot so

636
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,599
it's probably not for for for

637
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,599
you know fabric pot people either but if

638
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:07,199
you're growing in

639
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,399
a plastic pot that is of a size that you

640
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,120
can

641
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,440
realistically turn the plant over and

642
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,359
you know give it one shake so it

643
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,320
dislodges from the pots and you look at

644
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,479
it

645
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,200
that would seem to be your

646
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,599
best case if maybe the only case where

647
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,759
checking for that works so let's say

648
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,359
that i am using you know a 5 or 10

649
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,359
gallon and it's dried enough that it's

650
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,000
not gonna fall apart and i turn it over

651
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,240
and i've i've got it cradled in my hand

652
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,400
so i don't break the the um

653
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,798
the stem and i give it a one quick shake

654
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,240
and it slides out and now i'm looking at

655
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,720
the roots

656
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,798
what are we looking for

657
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:50,480
so what you want to see is really white

658
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:53,359
uh full plump roots so you don't really

659
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,360
want to see much brown uh kind of dead

660
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,839
looking roots and you want to see a lot

661
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,759
of them too so so depending on how old

662
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,480
the plant you know what we what we

663
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,480
consider a healthy plug or

664
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,798
you know a healthy potted plant

665
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,880
is you want to see um

666
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,319
you know it root bound almost like not

667
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,679
not too much where it's unhealthy but

668
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,079
you really want to see those white roots

669
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,720
like all the way around and what i've

670
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,359
seen uh too many times with pythium root

671
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,640
rot is you'll look at that root ball

672
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:26,319
and you barely see any roots around that

673
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,960
uh soil media or you know whatever media

674
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:32,158
you're growing on it just looks like you

675
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,000
know and the roots you do see are brown

676
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,000
you'll see like maybe some white roots

677
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
but they're attached um

678
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,359
you know a part of them as brown

679
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,278
so

680
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,038
so it

681
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,119
you should be looking for

682
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,960
white healthy roots and then you can

683
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,479
feel better about like oh yeah like i

684
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,679
don't think there's much of a problem

685
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,240
and and um you know i i'm always for

686
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,080
for testing so that's also like a good

687
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,839
time you know it's it's

688
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,960
especially depending on how many plants

689
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,639
you have and you don't want to

690
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,360
compromise your operation or all your

691
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,200
grow you know it doesn't hurt to also

692
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,319
get a soil test

693
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,159
and

694
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,639
since you're not sending tissue to these

695
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,000
labs and it's pretty inexpensive you can

696
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,000
tell really quick like yeah but i'm

697
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,119
getting yellowing of my leaves like

698
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,960
isn't that a symptom of pythium uh or my

699
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,639
plants aren't growing that much you can

700
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,400
at least um

701
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,320
kind of on your checklist or what have

702
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,759
you get away with oh i have a nutrient

703
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,158
deficiency because at least if you send

704
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,720
the soil you can see oh i have adequate

705
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,080
nutrients like my ph is in a good range

706
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,278
so so

707
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,960
um

708
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,519
so say you know you're getting the

709
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,600
yellowing and it's it's deficiency of

710
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,759
nutrients uh

711
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,359
you know at least you'll know that uh

712
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:44,798
because i'm sure it can be confusing if

713
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,000
you have yellowing plants and your roots

714
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,720
are looking really healthy and you're

715
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,640
like oh but what's going on like so so i

716
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,919
feel like that's one good that's that's

717
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,679
one tool that you can put in your

718
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,120
toolbox for sure

719
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,120
just to eliminate it because i don't

720
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,119
expect all your growers to just become

721
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,719
plant pathologist overnight and i think

722
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:01,918
that's a little bit of the stressful

723
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,000
part

724
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
into where i think research and

725
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,839
extension

726
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,360
and services need to really match the

727
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,599
industry and the home growers and the

728
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,000
popularity of cannabis

729
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,879
because we really want to help and

730
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,038
and a lot of these things um you know i

731
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
can name out symptoms but a lot of them

732
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,359
can span across you know pythium

733
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:26,079
fusarium symptoms look very similar and

734
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,079
i wouldn't you know i wouldn't expect

735
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,798
growers to know the difference between

736
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,359
them uh just just looking at you know

737
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,519
even cuttings or mature plants like you

738
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,319
can definitely get a idea of like oh is

739
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,319
this is this unhealthy but i wonder if

740
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,918
it's disease or i wonder if it's

741
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,119
environmental or nutrient and i feel

742
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,038
like that's the first question you

743
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,278
should be asking yourself truly not what

744
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,038
disease is it but is it a disease and

745
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,599
then the second question once you've

746
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,759
figured out oh it must like i think or

747
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,798
you know this is from a pathogen these

748
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,879
symptoms then okay what pathogen now so

749
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:02,240
i think there is uh i do want to stress

750
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,720
like the steps of diagnosis in general

751
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,798
um when working with any crop because

752
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,880
even if you presented me with two plants

753
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,759
one had fusarium wilt one had pythium

754
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,080
wilt uh i wouldn't feel confident within

755
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,519
my diagnosis or assessment unless you

756
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,119
know i was putting those roots under a

757
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,359
microscope slide like looking at the

758
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,678
structures like you know you can even go

759
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,759
as far as molecularly identifying it

760
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,759
which you know usually isn't isn't

761
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,679
needed for certain cases

762
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,519
uh and things like that but again like i

763
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,679
don't think growers should have to bear

764
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,558
that responsibility i think there should

765
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,798
be um resources that can help with that

766
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,720
yeah well as as we get into better

767
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,200
relationship with the federal government

768
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,360
and are able to take advantage of

769
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,880
you know more um

770
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,959
you know resources within the

771
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,278
agricultural industry like extension

772
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,038
agents and stuff we'll we'll have a lot

773
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,880
more help i mean for years cannabis

774
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,240
cultivators have been been pretty much

775
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,799
on our own

776
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,120
um so let's say that we we do have a

777
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,879
plant and it's already pithium wilting

778
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,038
and you've already clearly established

779
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,919
that once once the plant has gone full

780
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,599
wilt

781
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,640
that uh that it's done and so um

782
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,678
so

783
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,520
what do we do to dispose of this plant

784
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,960
because i'm not thinking i want to take

785
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,398
that plant

786
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,200
and and just throw throw the substrate

787
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:24,000
back into my compost pile uh and and

788
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,240
take the risk of increasing the overall

789
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,200
amount of pithium in my soil supply so

790
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,798
like

791
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,399
i probably want to take it away from my

792
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,879
whole property right

793
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:37,119
yes yeah bag it tag it double bag it get

794
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,559
it out of there don't compost it make

795
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,918
sure you get all the debris i think

796
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:41,440
that's why it's really important like

797
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,600
not just you know

798
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,960
take it out but really like bag it

799
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,119
contain it like you know you don't want

800
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,480
that soil particle going anywhere you

801
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,918
don't you don't want any of those

802
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,798
infected leaves falling anywhere you

803
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,520
just just to be safe just bag the whole

804
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,359
plant and uh and yeah get it get it out

805
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,319
of your growing operation and do not

806
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,479
compost it is is the best the best

807
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,240
situation uh if you get a pythium

808
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
outbreak or you know a plant that's

809
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,079
fully wilted you don't want it uh to be

810
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,278
around the rest of your plants man the

811
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,798
thing that irks me and you'd be

812
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,640
surprised that you see it is you know

813
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,839
someone will have a wilted plant it

814
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,600
doesn't even matter if it was from

815
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,359
pythium but if you have like an infected

816
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,519
plant or a plant that's wilted or just

817
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,439
any debris that you're not

818
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,720
growing with or just like some plant

819
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,798
that's sitting in the corner that you're

820
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,278
gonna deal with later like deal with it

821
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,319
as soon as you can because the more that

822
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,519
you know

823
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,519
dead tissue just sitting or dead debris

824
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,278
sitting near your healthy plants uh

825
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,918
there's lots of plant pathogens that

826
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,440
like to feed on uh dead tissue decaying

827
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,880
organic tissue and you know we're going

828
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,480
to talk about fusarium in a little bit

829
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,640
fusarium's you know

830
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,880
a very efficient saprophyte and it would

831
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,880
love to stick around and hang out on all

832
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,559
those wilted leaves kind of sitting in

833
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,480
the corner and botrytis is another one

834
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,240
you know we start getting to more foliar

835
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,399
pathogens that you could really avoid

836
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,839
just by bagging that plan up getting it

837
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,839
out like deal with it right when it

838
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,798
happens uh and

839
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:06,000
you know your past self will thank uh

840
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:08,398
future self so yeah my uh my growing

841
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,640
mentor hector um he would love hearing

842
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,558
you say this and he'd feel so justified

843
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,038
because uh you know i was brought into

844
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,038
this scene and he was meticulous with

845
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,440
any time we were removing

846
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,278
um leaves from the plant

847
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,919
to put them in a bag that was then

848
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,359
removed from the property and you know i

849
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,520
always found that a little tedious and

850
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,439
time consuming and then when i got into

851
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,240
the regenerative growing

852
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,519
scene i felt like a bit vindicated

853
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,159
because so many um regenerative growers

854
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,119
will remove leaves off the plant and

855
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,320
then

856
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,959
put them on top of the container down on

857
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,480
the soil near the base of the stem

858
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,200
so that

859
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,798
that leaf can degrade and you know the

860
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,000
idea is that the nutrition goes back

861
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,679
into the soil as well as making home for

862
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,278
you know little

863
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,840
you know small organisms that live on

864
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,319
the top of the soil and things like that

865
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,439
but what but what you're explaining to

866
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,000
me is that

867
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,240
this is absolutely increasing risk of

868
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,398
pathogens without a question

869
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,839
yes and and you know i i've got to

870
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,599
applaud like the person who wants to

871
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,278
take you know

872
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,199
be sustainable and not want to waste

873
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,759
like tissue but there is a place for

874
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,120
that tissue and it's in a compost

875
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,879
it's in a compost that's going to be

876
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,639
like treated and away from your healthy

877
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,760
plants because yeah right when you take

878
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,240
any type of debris and put it especially

879
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:33,519
like in a nice moist place like on top

880
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,319
of the uh soil where your healthy plants

881
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,200
growing you know i i can imagine i could

882
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,879
honestly already see the botrytis or

883
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,720
like diseases like coming for that

884
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,960
tissue like within you know a couple

885
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,759
days like it it really doesn't take long

886
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,600
for another issue to occur uh

887
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,839
for for when you have any plant debris

888
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,000
yeah any type of organic matter even

889
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,839
soil that's hit your floor like you know

890
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,558
that's where cleaning really comes in as

891
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,079
a good proper preventative so not just

892
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:01,839
getting rid of the plant debris getting

893
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,759
rid of soil debris and anything that can

894
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,798
just kind of hang out around your

895
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:09,599
healthy plants uh because um you know

896
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:11,599
not only like insects but lots of uh

897
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,959
lots of pathogens will hang out there

898
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,798
stay dormant until you know

899
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,720
until they're given an opportunity yeah

900
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,319
totally until they you know that little

901
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,480
piece ends up on your shoe and then that

902
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,158
shoe goes trudging in your side garden

903
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,839
and you know like so it's it's just

904
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,480
better to sweep get all that stuff out

905
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:31,678
of there and uh it's just yeah

906
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,200
it's the best best uh procedure right on

907
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,798
so we're gonna take a short break and be

908
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,480
right back when we come back we're gonna

909
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,960
do this same thing again but with

910
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,640
fusarium you are listening to shaping

911
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,890

northern california while the current

absolute best traits that a line has to

924
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,120
offer this kind of breeding takes time

talent and space to work

folks can't even identify it as cannabis

945

968
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,119
for years organic cultivators have been

969
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,598
looking for a replacement for using peat

970
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,440
moss peat moss has long been the go-to

971
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,519
soil amendment for water retention and

972
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,679
container growing but organic growers

973
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,759
know that peat moss is an unsustainable

974
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,440
resource and the mining of peat bogs

975
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,839
destroys habitat and releases

976
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,679
sequestered carbon but peat moss works

977
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,440
so well that many have continued to use

978
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,519
it but now there's finally a

979
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,599
revolutionary replacement for peat moss

980
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,119
that shares the same benefits while also

981
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,160
being sustainable

982
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,160
pit moss sounds and axe like peat moss

983
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,159
but instead of being mined from fragile

984
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,960
ecosystems it actually is made from

985
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,879
upcycled organic paper and tree bark pit

986
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,720
moss is excellent at retaining water in

987
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,480
your substrate and creating air pockets

988
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,439
and tiny living environments for

989
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,000
microbes pit moss instantly increases

990
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,599
aeration nutrient absorption and water

991
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,920

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,838
carefully and locally sourced pit moss

993
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,639
is the result of decades-long research

994
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:45,039
into the use of recycled paper fibers

995
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,679
pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat

996
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:50,320
moss and handles exactly the same and

997
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,159
like peat moss pit moss is inert so it

998
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,000
won't change your ph

999
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,319
available in a range of preparations

including a nutrient enhanced blend a

1001
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,760
coco coir blend and also as an organic

1002
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:04,000
soil conditioner with no added nutrients

1003
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,960
pit moss is also available as an animal

[Music]

1011
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,039
businesses everywhere are striving to

1012
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,880
reach people through advertising we all

1013
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,880
know though that trying to reach a

1014
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,400
cannabis audience with a quality message

1015
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,320
is pretty difficult

1016
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,280
that's why many people choose to

1017
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,599
advertise on the shaping fire podcast

1018
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,359
advertising on this show allows us time

1019
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,000
to talk about your product service or

1020
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,239
brand in a way that really lets people

1021
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,519
know what sets your company apart from

1022
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,159
others

1023
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,920
bold people who own companies know that

1024
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,719
getting into relationship with their

1025
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,760
customers is essential and that is what

1026
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:58,879
we offer we will explain your service or

1027
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,200
product what sets it apart as desirable

1028
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,240
and help our audience get in contact

1029
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,399
with you

1030
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,559
it's pretty simple really advertising

1031
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,079
does not have to be all whiz-bang smoke

1032
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,639
and mirrors nowadays i find that people

1033
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,280
prefer just to be spoken to calmly

1034
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,559
accurately and with good intentions

1035
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,960
if you want to make your own commercial

1036
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,440
spot well you can do that too

1037
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,440
during these pandemic days conventions

1038
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,000
and cannabis events are pretty poorly

1039
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,679
attended but podcast listening is

1040
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,679
skyrocketing

1041
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,519
with a commercial on shaping fire you'll

1042
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,440

00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,759

welcome back you are listening to

1060
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,199
shaping fire i'm your host shango los

1061
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,480
and my guest today is plant pathologist

1062
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:18,719
cora mcgee

1063
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,719
so we are essentially going to do second

1064
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,279
set like we did with first set where

1065
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:27,439
first set we were focusing on

1066
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,640
uh pythium the non-mold root mold

1067
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,320
but now we're going to talk about an

1068
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:34,159
actual mold which is called fusarium and

1069
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,359
honestly i would say that fusarium is

1070
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:39,199
probably more commonly known in cannabis

1071
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,598
because you know pretty much anything

1072
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,719
that wilts we say oh it's got fusarium

1073
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,800
wilt and i bet you that a good share of

1074
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,078
the plants that actually die from

1075
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,560
pythium

1076
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,800
when the story gets retold later that

1077
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:56,480
night over beers that pythium is

1078
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,440
actually being sold as fusarium because

1079
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,400
you know

1080
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,960
fusarium wilt looks an awful lot if not

1081
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,000
exactly like pythium wilt so

1082
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,920
um

1083
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,559
you know what like let's start the same

1084
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,800
way is are there multiple fusarium

1085
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,639
species that cannabis cultivators run

1086
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,400
into problems with or is it really only

1087
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,440
just one

1088
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,200
there's some main ones uh that

1089
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,200
researchers and pathologists have been

1090
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:24,159
identifying down at the species level

1091
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:26,480
within um more commercial greenhouses

1092
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,358
but you know it stays true to gardeners

1093
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,760
as well

1094
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:32,239
so fusarium oxysporum

1095
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,359
that is a really common fusarium that a

1096
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,879
lot of people

1097
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,639
have started seeing in cannabis

1098
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,200
including myself uh sophia max oxosporum

1099
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:44,078
is a fusarium wilt

1100
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:46,399
it causes fusarium wilt and

1101
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,680
it's it's pretty common it's a pretty

1102
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,440
common fusarium across all host species

1103
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,358
uh so i guess we weren't too surprised

1104
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,320
when you know started realizing cannabis

1105
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:58,880
was susceptible to this this pathogen

1106
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,160
and um another fusarium that causes more

1107
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,318
of a root rot is uh fusarium solani

1108
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,039
and i haven't personally seen this in

1109
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:09,759
cannabis but dr punja

1110
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,480
he's a pathologist in canada who's been

1111
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,000
surveying i feel like he hits a he comes

1112
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,880
out with a new paper every like six

1113
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,280
months

1114
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,680
uh with all different pathogens that he

1115
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,960
finds in commercial marijuana facilities

1116
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,358
as well from you know soil to

1117
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,599
hydroponics you name it and and it seems

1118
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,679
that that fusarium oxusporum and

1119
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,720
fusarium solania are the two biggest

1120
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:32,159
that he finds in abundance uh within

1121
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,118
within these facilities and that's

1122
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,838
mostly the roots the root rots the crown

1123
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,240
rots and the wilts

1124
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:42,078
um and and it's funny i you know if you

1125
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,559
zero mocks the sperm can found can be

1126
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,359
found in mature plants uh causing the

1127
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,838
will but i've also encountered it within

1128
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,279
uh cutting production so at the younger

1129
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:52,559
tissue stage

1130
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,960
and

1131
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,519
and i just wanted to say real quick uh

1132
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,720
fusarium doesn't just affect

1133
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:02,079
roots or cause wilt uh fusarium can also

1134
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,639
uh be

1135
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,400
a fungus that attacks the buds of the

1136
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,440
cannabis plants as well so just like you

1137
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,440
were saying you know it sounds like

1138
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,838
fusarium is getting a lot of the credit

1139
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,358
uh where pythium may be involved

1140
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:18,000
uh but i think the same goes for

1141
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,920
the fuserium that that a few researchers

1142
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,559
not just myself but i saw cornell has

1143
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,039
seen this as well within cannabis buds

1144
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,119
his fusarium is detected on that as well

1145
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:29,279
so i'm sure when growers see

1146
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,838
mold growing on the bud they they

1147
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,440
immediately are like oh botrytis

1148
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,679
because that's a common one and i've

1149
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,119
seen botrytis on the buds as well

1150
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,719
but i just i just want to let your

1151
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,400
listeners know you know

1152
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,480
again just going back to where testing

1153
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,400
is really important that could also be

1154
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,480
caused by fusarium

1155
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,160
and there are some

1156
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,240
some differences between them but again

1157
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,159
you know you'd uh it would really help

1158
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,239
if you had diagnostic tools or if you

1159
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:57,679
had a pathologist that that could help

1160
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,598
identify it i'm not expecting um you

1161
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,519
know home growers or even some

1162
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,599
commercial growers to really tell the

1163
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,039
difference uh with that mold because it

1164
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,000
looks it looks similar it looks very

1165
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:10,719
similar does fusarium on the buds look

1166
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,400
like botrytis or will it present

1167
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:13,598
differently

1168
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,960
so

1169
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,440
it's hard to say because it depends

1170
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,760
who's looking at it right uh so if i

1171
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,800
were to look at it um from afar i

1172
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,160
probably couldn't tell but once you

1173
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,079
start getting more up close like

1174
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:25,279
botrytis is you know it's called gray

1175
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,839
mold because

1176
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,760
the canadia uh and the spores the actual

1177
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,159
what you see

1178
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,319
the mold fuzzy part on your plants it

1179
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,239
has kind of like a grayish color to it

1180
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,639
for botrytis and then also the way

1181
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:41,039
botrytis grows it grows in like uh

1182
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,559
chains so so that's something that i

1183
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,400
would know and that i would try to look

1184
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,039
for when looking at it but when i've

1185
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,119
seen fusarium grow on bud it has more of

1186
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,440
a white color it has more of like a

1187
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,240
white thread like growth

1188
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,358
uh versus like um spores and chains

1189
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:00,479
which botrytis uh which botrytis kind of

1190
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:03,598
that that is characteristic to botrytis

1191
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,880
uh so so i would say yes to me i saw a

1192
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,880
difference but to tell you the truth

1193
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,000
when i first saw a fusarium on the bud

1194
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,760
i'm not gonna lie i was like oh well

1195
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,519
maybe it's botrytis because i really

1196
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,079
haven't seen any reports a you serious

1197
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:16,559
on fusarium on on the bud and you know

1198
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,240
that'd be kind of crazy because um you

1199
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:19,358
do want to really look out for that

1200
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,639
because

1201
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:24,880
fusarium head blight on corn

1202
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,960
uh is you know some species are known

1203
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,000
for producing mycotoxins and those can

1204
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,199
be you know harmful toxins if humans

1205
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,719
ingest them and and so and so it's it

1206
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,358
again it's not something you should just

1207
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:39,118
kind of uh

1208
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:40,400
forget about you you really want to get

1209
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,640
a good diagnosis

1210
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,960
diagnostic

1211
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,358
take on on what you're looking at uh

1212
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,400
within that bud but anyway going back to

1213
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,920
the story when i was looking at that bud

1214
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,318
uh right when i put it under the

1215
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,920
microscope though i mean it it you know

1216
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,400
the structures are very different

1217
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,838
between botrytis and fusarium so i

1218
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,559
immediately was like whoa i have a

1219
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:04,078
fusarium and then i went further and i

1220
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,920
not only

1221
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,519
uh looked at the museum under the

1222
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,680
microscope that i saw on the cannabis

1223
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,838
but i put it in culture so when i say i

1224
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,519
put it in culture there's um

1225
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,078
a nutrient media that you can put in

1226
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,920
petri dishes and you know that's how we

1227
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,960
can grow out different pathogens to

1228
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,079
really see um

1229
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,159
morphological characteristics and

1230
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,960
culture and that can help identify so

1231
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:29,759
fusariums and culture are well known for

1232
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,358
creating vibrant colorful pigments right

1233
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,960
so when you put botrytis in culture

1234
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:33,838
you're going to see those kind of like

1235
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,838
gray

1236
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:38,078
uh

1237
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,239
gray spores in the petri dish and then

1238
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,800
they'll also go on if it sits longer in

1239
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,479
the culture it'll create a sclerotinia

1240
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,400
which are their resting structures that

1241
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,000
can survive and you know substrates and

1242
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,639
things like that they almost look like

1243
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,519
tiny mustard seeds almost like black uh

1244
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:53,039
little

1245
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,960
uh rocks

1246
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,358
that's what their structures look like

1247
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,440
but fusarium can create these gorgeous

1248
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:01,920
well i say gorgeous but very like

1249
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,920
vibrant colors um and pigments and

1250
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,519
culture so fusarium oxisporum as we were

1251
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,358
saying which is common in cannabis that

1252
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,079
create that can create and culture a

1253
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,400
very uh pretty kind of purple lavender

1254
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,960
color and culture and the fusarium that

1255
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,280
i picked up on the bud had this uh very

1256
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,519
striking kind of orangish red color and

1257
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,519
culture uh and then i actually had that

1258
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:22,960
fusarium sequence you could tell i was

1259
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,119
like very curious

1260
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,280
so i was like okay i'm also gonna um i'm

1261
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,240
gonna sequence it so i can you know not

1262
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,480
just morphologically identify it

1263
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,479
but i also want to molecularly identify

1264
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,920
it again like you know fusarium

1265
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,280
structures can look very similar

1266
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,119
depending on species so it's like oh i

1267
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,280
wonder like what species this is and it

1268
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,960
was more of a curiosity thing and when

1269
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,680
we had it sequenced it turned out the

1270
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,838
fusarium sporotrichoides

1271
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,399
and uh and that's also been known as a

1272
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:53,519
fusarium head blight on like wheat and

1273
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,599
and uh more cereal crops so

1274
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:58,719
so it's a long story to say

1275
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,318
uh yeah fusarium is not just seen within

1276
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,559
the roots it can be within the bud and

1277
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:05,279
that's just one example of a personal

1278
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:08,400
story of how i've diagnosed uh to

1279
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,240
species level one on the bud and i think

1280
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,000
just as more pathologists get their

1281
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:13,439
hands uh

1282
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,280
on these different pathogens different

1283
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,519
production sites like maybe more reports

1284
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,720
will come out to see how common that is

1285
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,559
because that's something i can't really

1286
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,439
speak to is was that a rare occurrence

1287
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:26,559
it was in our research facility at uconn

1288
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,800
uh or you know is that is that a common

1289
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,719
uh common pathogen we see i i read

1290
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,640
something cornell has seen similar

1291
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:35,039
things on outdoor hemp production it's

1292
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,519
it and it actually they went as far as

1293
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:40,559
they saw that some fusariums they saw on

1294
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:42,800
cannabis uh buds did produce mycotoxins

1295
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,719
and i thought that was very interesting

1296
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,880
um and and something that the cannabis

1297
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,039
industry should uh should keep it its

1298
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,280
eyes and ears out for for sure i'm

1299
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:54,719
feeling so schooled and humbled at the

1300
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,720
moment because um i here on vashon

1301
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,559
island where i live

1302
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,919
you know i help a lot of patients with

1303
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,078
their grows

1304
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,358
because i'm kind of the local expert

1305
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,480
and

1306
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,960
we have been experiencing what i now

1307
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,679
think is fusarium

1308
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:16,000
all over the island the last two years

1309
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:17,838
and for me as i saw it i'm like wow this

1310
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,760
botrytis is really presenting

1311
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,679
differently this year right which now in

1312
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,480
retrospect that sounds so

1313
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:27,199
so novice but you know your your

1314
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,358
explanation of it was so good normally

1315
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:32,399
we would see botrytis which is you know

1316
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:34,558
the the gray spores and they kind of

1317
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,039
look like you know little gray clouds

1318
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,599
inside of the

1319
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,920
the flower but then about two years ago

1320
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,760
we started getting these what you know

1321
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:48,159
these white strands that you um describe

1322
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,079
that to me kind of look like like white

1323
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:53,118
cotton strands

1324
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,559
and and in my head i'm like oh it's like

1325
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,400
a um

1326
00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:00,960
a a spider mite got in here and did all

1327
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,400
of these white you know webbing instead

1328
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,159
of the kind of webbing they do on the

1329
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,800
crown right and i'm like they're all

1330
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,519
these like straight webbings of white

1331
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,039
and cottonyness inside the flower which

1332
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,199
is clearly a mold and clearly not

1333
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,519
something i want to smoke but also

1334
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,759
wasn't something that i had seen

1335
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,519
a lot of before

1336
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,280
last year which is interesting because

1337
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,599
the weather here for the last two years

1338
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,800
has been significantly wetter and colder

1339
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,400
earlier

1340
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,160
and um

1341
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,760
it's interesting that you would say that

1342
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,598
all of these what are essentially

1343
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,920
beautiful colors come out when you put

1344
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,039
it in the petri dish because the main

1345
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,280
way that we are identifying

1346
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,719
what i now will call fusarium in the

1347
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,960
buds because you know they're on the

1348
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,159
inside of the flower so the flower will

1349
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,920
look great

1350
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,279
normally until you crack it open and

1351
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,240
you're like oh god what's all this

1352
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,400
cottony stuff that's all white but the

1353
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,239
telltale sign which you know if you know

1354
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,960
your garden well you can see from across

1355
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:59,919
the greenhouse is that

1356
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,720
there will often be a part of the bud

1357
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,000
that has gone incredibly colorfully

1358
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,639
necrotic

1359
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,838
there will be like one leaf that will go

1360
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:11,920
like bright maroon or purple or pink or

1361
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:14,880
orange or something and you're like oh

1362
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,639
look at this fantastic gorgeous bud but

1363
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,760
there's that one

1364
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:21,519
there's that one sugar leaf on there

1365
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,160
that has gone

1366
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:26,800
you know royal purple or something

1367
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,118
and and then when you crack that bud

1368
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,400
open suddenly you see all of these

1369
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,960
cottony white strands

1370
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,119
a have you had that experience with the

1371
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,079
sugar leaf turning colors on the bud and

1372
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,240
second

1373
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:46,079
what causes the change in the color um

1374
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:49,118
what we say you know in the garden is

1375
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,119
like oh you know all the anthocyanins

1376
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,280
are showing right which would suggest

1377
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,640
that the chlorophyll has left the leaf

1378
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,319
and like i don't know that could all be

1379
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:57,759
bro science but i'm hoping you

1380
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:00,480
understand my example enough that you

1381
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:04,000
can just kind of generally speak to it

1382
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,519
yes so in my experience i did not see

1383
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,159
any um

1384
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:11,280
different coloration around where i had

1385
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,279
saw the fusarium bud rot on the on the

1386
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,119
bud and i think i caught it pretty early

1387
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,880
too because i didn't see a lot of dead

1388
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,280
tissue around

1389
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,318
uh the signs of the pathogen

1390
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,880
on the bud um so there's one

1391
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,679
and then two uh so i haven't had a lot

1392
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,640
of experience with the bud rot uh

1393
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:30,078
and

1394
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,480
and i'm not sure

1395
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,640
i'm not sure what produces the increase

1396
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,440
in pigments within the tissue and it's

1397
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:40,799
interesting because at uconn um since

1398
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,280
about 2018 2019 we have multiple

1399
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,280
researchers like looking at these types

1400
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,960
of interactions and seeing like how do

1401
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,440
different pathogens that are infecting

1402
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,318
these plants like affecting pigmentation

1403
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,119
how is it affecting genes uh how is it

1404
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,239
infecting trichomes so those are all

1405
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,920
um

1406
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,399
questions that i can't answer but

1407
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,119
hopefully are starting to get answered

1408
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,240
as research has been opened up for this

1409
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,000
crop because that's the thing it was

1410
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,639
kind of this crop we couldn't touch for

1411
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,239
years so that answer may

1412
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,719
the answer to that question may be

1413
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,239
answered within other crops but

1414
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,239
but i'm not sure if it's been answered

1415
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,719
within cannabis and it would be a very

1416
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,399
interesting research question uh because

1417
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,239
that could really be applicable to

1418
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,680
growers you know that could be maybe an

1419
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,838
early sign i've been seeing like a

1420
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,679
different pigmentation uh is that

1421
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,078
something that pissarium is causing

1422
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:32,480
unfortunately it seems to be a late sign

1423
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,240
because at any time about after the

1424
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,039
necrosis okay

1425
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:36,879
yeah

1426
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,358
we see that by the by the time we see

1427
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,079
that color it is time to

1428
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:44,639
uh either remove the whole plant or or

1429
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,960
adjust the crown and actually you use

1430
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,440
this term crown rot earlier in the show

1431
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,000
which i had not heard before and that

1432
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,760
sounds like the perfect phrase for what

1433
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,760
we've experienced these last two years

1434
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,839
where we've got this beautiful plant

1435
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:02,559
with this killer cola and the cola

1436
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:04,480
gets fusarium and then it shows one

1437
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:08,000
sugar leaf that changes color and we

1438
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,559
crack it open and it's it's got advanced

1439
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,400
uh cottoning you know these cotton white

1440
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,400
cotton strands on the inside and um and

1441
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,760
you know calling it crown rot it's you

1442
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,720
know that's a pretty cool name for it

1443
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,880
you know

1444
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,118
well i would call that bud rot so when i

1445
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,440
mentioned crown rot earlier crown has to

1446
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,720
do with the crown by the root zone oh i

1447
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,519
thought you meant the top of the plant

1448
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:30,399
yes

1449
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,639
no so so i was so i think um and it's

1450
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,400
totally easily uh

1451
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,799
misunderstood because when you talk

1452
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,880
about crown rot uh it's more at the base

1453
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,519
of the plant uh so that the crown of the

1454
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,400
root which fusariums can cause so that

1455
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,199
there are fusion crown rods out there uh

1456
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,039
such as like um fusarium solani i think

1457
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:50,799
i'm pretty sure has been reported as one

1458
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:52,400
however uh when we're talking about the

1459
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
bud rot

1460
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,119
um

1461
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,838
we wouldn't pathologists wouldn't call

1462
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,880
it a crown we'd call it bud like a bud

1463
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:03,039
rot because it's on the butt of that um

1464
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,960
you know part of the plant yes so just

1465
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,558
to clarify that for for that's good

1466
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,519
that's good clarification i appreciate

1467
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,240
that

1468
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:12,639
so um all right so circling back around

1469
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,759
to like the main thrust questions uh

1470
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:18,558
fusarium does is it in the soil all the

1471
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,200
time just like pythium is and it is also

1472
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,119
just looking for an opportunity to take

1473
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:24,879
over

1474
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,440
yes well unfortunately yeah it's a

1475
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,760
soil-borne pathogen so

1476
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,039
so you want to imagine uh it can be

1477
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,599
around especially you know you're

1478
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,679
growing and these living soils and

1479
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,559
there's lots of nice microbes in there

1480
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,799
and

1481
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,200
and you you don't want to create

1482
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,400
conditions that are conducive for the

1483
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,679
fusarium to to increase in population

1484
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,440
and then cause

1485
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:49,118
infection and get into your roots and

1486
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,358
then get into your stems because you

1487
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,160
know fusariums can also cause uh

1488
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:56,318
vascular issues vascular um

1489
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:58,399
stem rots and wilts within your plants

1490
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:00,079
as well so yes you know everything i

1491
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,760
said earlier

1492
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,519
about uh

1493
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,160
not to do within

1494
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,119
your pots to avoid pythium is very

1495
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:09,039
similar

1496
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,599
uh with fusarium such as you don't want

1497
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:13,599
to over water you don't want to damage

1498
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,599
those roots you don't want to have you

1499
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,039
want to have optimum nitrogen for your

1500
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,920
plants because you know cannabis or

1501
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,960
heavy

1502
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,480
heavy um feeders yes they're heavy

1503
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,559
feeders thank you

1504
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,800
but you don't want to have uh too much

1505
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,200
nitrogen you don't want to have too much

1506
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,039
compost on your plants uh because it can

1507
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,679
really uh again like we talked about

1508
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:36,000
create those those leaky roots and and

1509
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:39,440
create a really opportunistic

1510
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,159
uh time for that fusarium to infect uh

1511
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,159
and

1512
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,279
and the symptoms are really similar as

1513
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,000
well

1514
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,319
however fusarium since i said it can

1515
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,318
cause vascular wilts and basically like

1516
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,719
within the stem is what i mean when i

1517
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:55,440
say that you can sometimes see

1518
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,838
discoloration in the vascular tissue and

1519
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,599
even sometimes on the bottom of that

1520
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,838
stem you can sometimes see like a

1521
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,240
discoloration of a brownish or sometimes

1522
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:05,279
like a reddish brownish color at that

1523
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:06,959
bottom

1524
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,400
and you know if you wanted to

1525
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,240
sacrifice the plan if you're really

1526
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,920
having a feeling like oh this plant is

1527
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,719
looking sick its roots look compromised

1528
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,720
what have you if you cut open that stem

1529
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:19,199
and you kind of see this hollow

1530
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:20,558
or a discoloration within your stem

1531
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,719
tissue then that's a that's a good

1532
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,760
telltale sign yeah i may i may have

1533
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:28,798
fusarium uh within my plant

1534
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:32,000
i'm assuming that you know if if if the

1535
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:34,400
fusarium is in my soil on a day-to-day

1536
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
basis and um

1537
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,639
would it be fair to say that it is

1538
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,559
dormant like we talked about the pythium

1539
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,798
yes yes yeah it has

1540
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,519
so it'll be dormant and then we make it

1541
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:48,880
wet which which you know causes it to

1542
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:51,119
get active and then we keep it wet which

1543
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,280
means that it's starting to thrive

1544
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,798
in a um

1545
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,599
anaerobic environment and then the roots

1546
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:59,440
are

1547
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,960
rotting and creating opportunity for it

1548
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,519
to get inside of the plant um

1549
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,599
like like like anywhere along this line

1550
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,960
this plant isn't coming back

1551
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:12,559
and so by the time we see the wilt uh

1552
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,559
i'm guessing we're in the same situation

1553
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,400
we were with the pythium where what did

1554
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,359
you say bag it and tag it and get it off

1555
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,200
the property yeah yep correct

1556
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,719
oh that's so sad sometimes i mean it's

1557
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,598
like one thing if you're if you're

1558
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:27,838
scaled right and you've got 500 plants

1559
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,079
but first you know since i don't do a

1560
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:32,880
lot with scaled growers and i'm more

1561
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:35,200
focused on on smaller patient gardens

1562
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,559
like sometimes that can be you know one

1563
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,039
plant can be

1564
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,000
you know 20 percent of somebody's entire

1565
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:42,239
grow

1566
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,960
during the summer and

1567
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,639
there's so much resistance to just

1568
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,440
throwing away the plant instead of

1569
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,759
trying to revive it but so the longer

1570
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,798
that plant stays in your garden the

1571
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,000
higher

1572
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:57,838
the the pathogen pathogenetic load to

1573
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,199
your garden the more likely that those

1574
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:03,679
pathogens will hop over to another plant

1575
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:06,159
right and i mean there is if you have

1576
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:08,798
less plants hopefully you can try to

1577
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,960
optimize their root zone and their

1578
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:14,318
health like as closely as you can to

1579
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,519
avoid uh this this occurring in the

1580
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:17,119
first place and you know i know your

1581
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,519
listeners are really into

1582
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:22,798
uh the microorganisms the beneficials

1583
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:24,838
within the living soil like you know if

1584
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:27,039
if you have a really good uh

1585
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:28,880
microorganism buffer i should say within

1586
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,279
your soil like hopefully that's another

1587
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,519
preventative defense uh that's you know

1588
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,359
can can be good to have into place and

1589
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:37,599
then you're right it's it really is like

1590
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:40,480
do not over please try not to over

1591
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,640
fertilize and over water because yeah

1592
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,199
that can you know eventually be a death

1593
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:47,519
sentence to a plant and and it and it is

1594
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,838
very sad because there's no corrective

1595
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,838
uh control measures you know it's all

1596
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,719
organic and and so it's all a

1597
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:56,318
preventative game and and i know we've

1598
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,558
been talking about that but that that

1599
00:57:56,318 --> 00:58:00,159
really is you know cleaning and just

1600
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,760
making sure those conditions are really

1601
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:03,519
good for the plant to avoid it from

1602
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,599
coming in in the first place and taking

1603
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:09,039
over it's interesting to think about the

1604
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:10,599
mechanics of that that death spiral in

1605
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:12,960
specifics right because if your

1606
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:14,640
microorganisms and the other

1607
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,960
you know living

1608
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:19,759
folks in the rhizosphere are actually

1609
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,119
one of your defenses against pythium and

1610
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,680
fusarium

1611
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,160
and first thing you do is you pour all

1612
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,440
this water in there and or maybe maybe

1613
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,358
it's the right amount of water but you

1614
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,838
have terrible drainage whatever reason

1615
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:34,000
you've got really damp soil so the first

1616
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,480
thing that's going to do is create an

1617
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,239
overly water environment that is going

1618
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,639
to wipe out a whole bunch of your

1619
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:43,598
microorganisms that are supposed to be

1620
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,279
part of your defenses and then

1621
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,119
you know you're creating this low oxygen

1622
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,839
and environment that's going to rot your

1623
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,400
roots and then like essentially it just

1624
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:54,480
leaves the field of play open for a big

1625
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,920
old pythium party

1626
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,838
right right yeah all right so um

1627
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,159
so we understand the living conditions

1628
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:04,239
and that this is all a preventative game

1629
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:07,199
and that you know once we've gotten to

1630
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:09,519
the point that we actually see the wilt

1631
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:11,279
like don't even try just like get you

1632
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:13,759
know bag it tag it and get it off the

1633
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,599
property so so

1634
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,040
i want to take all this and put it on

1635
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:21,680
its head before we before we leave this

1636
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:24,558
uh second set and that is um you know

1637
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,000
sometimes you gotta try to save it and

1638
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,440
and this is the example that i want to

1639
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,519
give you it's kind of an impossibility

1640
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,720
but but i want us to like kind of work

1641
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,039
it out anyway because i know that

1642
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:35,598
there's people including me who grow

1643
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:38,079
this way and let's imagine you've got a

1644
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:40,318
four foot by eight foot

1645
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,960
raised bed that you know let's just say

1646
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,480
it's like 18 or 22 inches deep and

1647
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,000
you're going to put multiple plants in

1648
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,679
there and the whole point is that you're

1649
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,280
gonna be you know growing you know

1650
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:51,598
you're gonna have living soil and

1651
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,240
companion plants and you're gonna have

1652
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:56,640
multiple cannabis plants in one bed so

1653
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:58,558
that you know all of their roots can

1654
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,960
talk to each other and they can share

1655
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:05,760
nutrition and information and it's just

1656
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:08,798
this big sexy regenerative success until

1657
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,599
one of the root zones gets fusarium or

1658
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:14,239
pythium and suddenly you see like let's

1659
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,760
say one of your six plants in this bed

1660
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:17,519
you come in in the morning and it is

1661
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,280
wilted and you know it's not water

1662
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:21,599
everybody else looks good

1663
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,400
but this one plant is totally screwed

1664
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,960
and

1665
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,599
um you know the idea to

1666
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,519
bag it and pitch it is great in theory

1667
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,160
except for the fact that

1668
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:34,639
um it's in this shared bed

1669
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,960
um so let's say that

1670
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,440
you know as the cultivator you really

1671
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,798
don't want to cull the entire bed

1672
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,119
because you know if you've done it right

1673
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,920
you've got you know tons of rocks in the

1674
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,358
bottom and then silt and and sand and

1675
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,720
you're like building your layers of

1676
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:50,159
substrate up and it's just this

1677
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:52,480
beautiful thing that took all this

1678
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,318
effort but now you've got this you know

1679
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,480
essentially this like like out of

1680
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,480
control pathogen that's in the root zone

1681
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,960
of one plant

1682
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,318
if we needed to try to at least try to

1683
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,838
save the bed

1684
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:08,079
what would your radical prescription be

1685
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:10,639
for trying to

1686
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,640
extricate that one plant

1687
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:13,679
and revive

1688
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,719
the

1689
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:19,440
the bed so that perhaps it doesn't

1690
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:21,279
spread to the rest of the bed

1691
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,960
so this might be really unpopular what

1692
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,640
i'm about to say so i apologize in

1693
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,079
advance to all the growers you don't

1694
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,759
want to gut the rest of the plants that

1695
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,839
were sharing the soil

1696
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,160
so it's really important first off to

1697
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:34,318
make sure that that diagnosis is a

1698
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,519
fusarium right you you want to make sure

1699
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:37,599
that

1700
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,280
that you have fusarium in the bed in the

1701
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,519
first place before you make these really

1702
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,079
dramatic calls but say it's like oh like

1703
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,519
i think it is i don't want to risk it

1704
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,680
what i would do

1705
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,000
is at first of course take the plant

1706
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:52,480
that was showing symptoms uh wilt or

1707
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,400
what have you get it out of the bed bag

1708
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,079
it get it out of your operation

1709
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,280
i would also

1710
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,720
i would get rid of the rest of the

1711
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,359
plants in that bed too because really

1712
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:04,000
you're just creating a happy habitat for

1713
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:06,960
that peasarium to now go to those those

1714
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,798
roots and and feed on those and you know

1715
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,240
if you've had a plant already wilt in

1716
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,239
that same bed you probably have pretty

1717
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:13,759
high populations of that fusarium

1718
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:15,598
already in that bed now so you don't

1719
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,520
want to increase that population even

1720
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,838
more and make it even harder down the

1721
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:22,000
road to be growing and that

1722
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:24,239
high raised bed or what have you

1723
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,719
so i would get rid of all the plants say

1724
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:28,798
you've got six plants in the bay one

1725
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:30,480
went down get rid of all of them and

1726
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:31,679
then at least

1727
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,679
um

1728
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,679
you may have like moderate populations

1729
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,838
of the fusarium because it hasn't had

1730
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:39,598
time to really you know feed on all six

1731
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,719
and and now you just have like a crazy

1732
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,440
amount of uh fusarium uh structures and

1733
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:47,519
infecting agents within that that soil

1734
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,039
uh so there's two things that come to

1735
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:50,239
mind once you've gotten rid of all the

1736
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,839
plants and now you're just left with

1737
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:54,078
this bed with again like you said all

1738
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:55,759
these layers i've i've really been um

1739
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,720
you know adding to my soil and making it

1740
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,599
healthy

1741
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:59,118
uh

1742
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,798
there's two things i'm going to say i'm

1743
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,480
not going to guarantee it'll work but

1744
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:05,679
you could at least try

1745
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,838
uh and see if it could eliminate um if

1746
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,440
you want to keep growing in this bed so

1747
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:12,000
one i would say is that you could try to

1748
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,798
cook the soil so so when i say try to

1749
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,880
like cook the soil i'm saying try to

1750
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:18,559
create an environment where you're gonna

1751
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,920
you're gonna try to

1752
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:22,480
get a lot of temperature get the

1753
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,960
temperatures really high within that bed

1754
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,039
so it can hopefully uh kill those

1755
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,240
infecting tropicals and those structures

1756
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:33,200
so a way to do this is you can get um

1757
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:35,118
some plastic some some clear plastic so

1758
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,439
the sun can penetrate through and you

1759
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,798
want to really seal it around in that

1760
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,880
bed like make sure there's no air

1761
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:44,159
pockets you really want to get that

1762
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,838
clear plastic on top of that soil layer

1763
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,078
put a bunch of bricks around it what

1764
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:49,838
have you and and it really helps when

1765
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,359
it's a hot summer day as well because

1766
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:53,838
you know if you do it right you can get

1767
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:55,038
temperatures up to like 120 degrees

1768
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:58,000
fahrenheit

1769
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,359
that can really help penetrate and kill

1770
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,358
some of those

1771
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:03,358
infecting propagules within that bed so

1772
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,119
that's one and again just depending on

1773
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:06,880
how bad the populations are it may be

1774
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,960
effective

1775
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,039
so it's something to try

1776
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,599
and then another option

1777
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,599
uh which i i've heard other extension

1778
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,798
agents talk about this within uh

1779
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,599
cannabis

1780
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,679
is you know crop rotation

1781
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,680
so i i know you really want to put

1782
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:24,558
cannabis back in that bay really badly

1783
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:27,279
you know that's where you grow your

1784
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,960
cannabis plants but but since you know

1785
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,240
that there's fusarium right now in it

1786
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,519
and it's compromised but you don't want

1787
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,759
to gut the bed out you don't want to

1788
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,519
waste all that good substrate uh you

1789
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,599
could try to

1790
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:40,719
plant another crop that season in that

1791
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,920
bed uh so i've heard hairy vetch

1792
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:43,358
um

1793
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,519
some people like see it as kind of like

1794
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:48,318
a weed but it has a really pretty purple

1795
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:50,480
flower kind of pee like leaves so it's

1796
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:53,119
called hairy vetch and it it's actually

1797
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,639
shown that if you use it as a

1798
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,640
crop

1799
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:59,199
within fields where watermelon get

1800
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:02,639
fusarium it's shown to show suppression

1801
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:05,038
of fusarium within uh within that that

1802
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:07,440
field so so you could try something like

1803
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,839
that putting another crop

1804
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,400
that is either can help suppress the

1805
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:14,239
fusarium over time or that just isn't

1806
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,519
cannabis so you can really you're really

1807
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,000
just trying to decrease those

1808
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:21,280
populations now in that soil so that you

1809
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,880
can eventually put cannabis back in it

1810
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,160
and feel more confident that you're not

1811
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,480
going to have another

1812
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,279
outbreak

1813
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,519
wow

1814
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,680
that's actually a pretty

1815
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:33,920
like novel idea using a plan for kind of

1816
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:35,919
using it as a beneficial i really was

1817
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,519
expecting you to talk more like when you

1818
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,358
when you did that apology at the

1819
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:41,038
beginning i really thought you were

1820
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,318
gonna go into

1821
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,640
um

1822
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:46,960
uh like anti-fungal drench or something

1823
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,558
like that um which isn't what isn't

1824
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,679
which isn't really how you went with it

1825
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,720
um so i guess i will are there any

1826
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:56,318
um

1827
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:57,679
you know organic or omri omni summary

1828
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:59,119
certified

1829
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:03,038
um

1830
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:05,599
fungicides that you think might solve

1831
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,280
this issue now granted this is this is

1832
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,798
like a nuclear option right because it's

1833
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,240
also probably going to take down your

1834
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,119
mycelium networks and everything else so

1835
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:15,038
like this is not what we want to do but

1836
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,920
people who do all sorts of radical

1837
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:20,079
things uh when they've got an infest or

1838
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,159
you know an infected bed so so i figure

1839
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:24,960
it's worth asking

1840
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:26,318
yeah so there's there's a few um there's

1841
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,000
there's actually quite a bit of

1842
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:29,679
biological fungicides that are out there

1843
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
that you can i'm pretty sure you can now

1844
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:33,759
use within cannabis uh but there's

1845
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,199
there's three that come to my mind that

1846
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,520
are more efficient towards fusarium

1847
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:41,199
uh and and they're all biological

1848
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:42,719
fungicides so a good way to think of it

1849
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,719
as good microbes versus your bad

1850
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,159
microbes such as your fusariums the bad

1851
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:49,279
microbe and the good microbes that i

1852
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:51,358
have in mind are pseudomonas uh species

1853
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,960
and biological uh fungicides so you can

1854
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:54,880
just look it'll say active ingredient

1855
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,559
when you read the label and if it if

1856
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,480
it's a pseudomonas strand and if it's

1857
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,359
labeled for fusarium

1858
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,039
um

1859
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:03,199
diseases then that's that's a good

1860
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,720
contender that you could use another one

1861
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:06,078
that's really popular that i've used

1862
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:08,798
because it's it's really efficient

1863
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:11,519
within uh suppressing pythium is root

1864
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:14,639
shield so that's a trichoderma

1865
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:16,960
which is a beneficial fungi that can

1866
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:20,159
mycoparasitize

1867
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:23,760
other bad fungi or oomy seeds so it's

1868
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:26,078
really efficient in in that and bacillus

1869
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,599
so bacillus is a bacteria psoas

1870
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,480
pseudomonas the one that i said earlier

1871
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,000
those are both beneficial bacterias uh

1872
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,880
and and there's a lot of products such

1873
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
as triathlon ba is a biofungicide that

1874
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,920
comes to mind with bacillus in it and uh

1875
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,519
and companion now i think they just came

1876
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,079
out with a new formula like companion

1877
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:46,000
max so these would all be uh good

1878
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,000
formulations that you could use that are

1879
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,639
organic they're omni-certified like you

1880
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,719
said um and you could you could like try

1881
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:54,798
to try to put those in the bed but it

1882
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:56,639
just depends how high those fusarium

1883
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:59,119
populations are

1884
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:02,480
uh to see how effective those biological

1885
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:04,559
fungicides will be on helping colonize

1886
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,119
that fusarium that's in the bed and prey

1887
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:09,039
upon it but yeah like that's another

1888
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,559
another good solution that you could you

1889
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,240
could try out and those are the three

1890
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,359
that come to my mind that are that have

1891
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:15,279
been

1892
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:16,960
pretty efficient towards fusarium right

1893
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,798
on and then and then after you use them

1894
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,439
as a nuclear option you're gonna be left

1895
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:24,238
with a bed that's like out of balance

1896
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,479
and you're gonna have to spend some time

1897
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,879
you know like rebuilding the biology

1898
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:31,039
which is why you know it is considered a

1899
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,159
nuclear option where you're just trying

1900
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:34,880
to

1901
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:37,519
you know save

1902
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:40,079
maybe not save the living part of the

1903
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,480
soil but just not have to replace the

1904
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:45,039
soil and the silt and this you know sand

1905
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:46,718
and the rocks and and like start over

1906
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:48,158
with a clean slate like you're like

1907
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,158
maybe you can

1908
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,318
maybe you can save your inputs but

1909
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:54,639
you're gonna have to rebuild the biology

1910
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,319
after you use something like that

1911
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,798
right and i don't think it's a bad thing

1912
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:00,798
so i think we see it as oh if we add

1913
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:02,319
these products they'll be so dominant

1914
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:04,319
like we'll just have like bacillus in

1915
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,359
the bed or we'll just have pseudomonas

1916
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:10,560
but i think we need as researchers

1917
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:12,560
um to really look into what will happen

1918
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,920
uh when we just add these products to

1919
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,279
because i mean we're talking about like

1920
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,880
outdoor

1921
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,400
uh beds even if they're indoors like you

1922
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,640
know you got silly you got rocks you

1923
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:24,479
have you have soil that you had there

1924
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,640
previously i'm i'm not so sure if adding

1925
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,798
these biological products would totally

1926
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,279
dominate you know this microorganism

1927
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:33,278
community in there if if anything you

1928
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,199
know i would hypothesize that adding

1929
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,279
them may recruit other different

1930
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:39,039
organisms to make up in the bed and

1931
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,799
things like that like i think we

1932
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:43,600
underestimate how complex these

1933
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:46,238
microorganism communities are

1934
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,079
uh within all these different

1935
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:50,238
living situations so i i think that

1936
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,158
would be like a really interesting uh

1937
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,559
thing to study like you know if i have a

1938
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:56,559
bed uh that had high populations in

1939
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,320
fusarium if i added a biofungicide how

1940
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,719
does that reduce the populations and how

1941
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,639
does that change the microbial makeup of

1942
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,719
that bed i think all these are very like

1943
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,079
unanswered questions that hopefully in

1944
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:08,319
the next you know five ten years with

1945
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:10,479
all these researchers now getting grants

1946
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:11,840
to study cannabis like something that

1947
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:13,198
we'll have more answers for because

1948
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,679
that's that's something i just i just

1949
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:18,079
don't know hear hear i love that answer

1950
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:20,158
i love that i was doomed i was dooming

1951
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:22,238
about the whole thing and you're like oh

1952
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:24,639
you know let's trust the microbes which

1953
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:26,639
is usually my answer for things so i

1954
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,000
love that so all right cool well we're

1955
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,520
going to take another short break and be

1956
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,359
right back you are listening to shaping

1957
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,640
fire and my guest today is plant

1958
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:35,759
pathologist cora mcgee

1959
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,679
[Music]

1960
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,440
there are so many seed banks nowadays

1961
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,679
that you really have options in who to

1962
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,519
choose not only that if you pick the

1963
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,000
wrong seed bank you could be in for a

1964
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,239
really sketchy ride and that's only one

1965
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,920

2014
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:37,679
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

2015
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,519
growing is so valued by farmers is

2016
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,600
because the mycelium networks in the

2017
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,480
soil remain established from year to

2018
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,320
year

2019
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:46,479
and we know these fungal networks are

2020
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,799
essential because they are the nutrient

2021
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:51,678
super highways that extend far and wide

2022
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,920
in the substrate to feed your plants the

2023
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,239
trouble with growing in new living soils

2024
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,800
or blended cocoa substrates is that it

2025
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:01,678
takes most of the plant's life just to

2026
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:04,640
create these mycelium highways

2027

dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

2028

when uh the soil is too wet um but a

2131
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:58,479
couple times you have mentioned um not

2132
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,520
not causing the

2133
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:04,079
pythium and fusarium to spread by you

2134
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,320
know keeping things clean right

2135
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,158
and um

2136
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:10,158
while

2137
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:13,519
how do i want to say this while lip

2138
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,799
service is given to oh you know wiping

2139
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,880
down your

2140
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:20,000
scissors or whatever in you know the

2141
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:22,000
cannabis cultivation scene um

2142
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,560
i gotta admit to myself i don't even

2143
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,560
know if i'm cleaning my tools right i

2144
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,640
mean i just cleaned my tools the way

2145
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:31,120
that my mentor taught me to clean my

2146
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,600
tools but i didn't learn that anywhere

2147
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:35,599
so let's start with that um what what

2148
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:38,320
tools should we be keeping clean and how

2149
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,840
do we clean those tools properly

2150
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:42,000
right so

2151
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:45,039
so pruners and shears and things like

2152
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,800
that uh things that you use to prune or

2153
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:50,000
take cuttings those definitely need to

2154
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,880
be sanitized and you can sanitize those

2155
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,479
by

2156
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:56,159
if you have isopropyl alcohol

2157
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:58,559
some people spray down their tools and

2158
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,839
wipe them uh i'm saying i'm not saying

2159
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,560
anything's wrong with that but

2160
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:05,760
personally i would fully submerge

2161
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:08,239
the tools in the isopropyl alcohol just

2162
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,840
to make sure you're getting um you know

2163
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:11,359
it's covering all the surface area and

2164
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,199
whatnot you're not missing anything when

2165
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:14,799
you just spray

2166
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:16,479
i think that would be one thing i would

2167
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,400
say and then

2168
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:20,718
you can also use a solution of 10

2169
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,879
percent bleach to also clean your tools

2170
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,279
which is pretty effective however i

2171
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,079
would give a contact time

2172
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,319
to sit in that ten percent bleach before

2173
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:32,640
you use them for all your plants for you

2174
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:34,399
know about five to ten minutes uh to

2175
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,800
really make sure that

2176
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:39,279
it's getting uh any

2177
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:42,159
any infecting uh tropicals that may be

2178
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:43,119
on those tools uh really you know give

2179
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:45,039
you

2180
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:46,559
security that that they should be

2181
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:49,119
cleaning when you say the contact time

2182
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,199
do you mean that the bleach solution

2183
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:53,279
should be like it should be soaking in

2184
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:55,359
the bleach solution for 10 minutes or

2185
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:58,238
are you saying that don't put it on your

2186
01:18:55,359 --> 01:19:00,158
plants for 10 minutes after you do it

2187
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:02,238
that's a good that's a good question to

2188
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:05,039
clear it up so i'm saying you want to

2189
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:07,279
you want to let your tool sit in the 10

2190
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:08,800
bleach solution for about 5 to ten

2191
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:10,559
minutes and then you can just wipe them

2192
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,719
off and use them but you just you do

2193
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,960
wanna make sure that within the the ten

2194
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:18,000
percent bleach solution that uh the

2195
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:19,840
contact time is is enough to where the

2196
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,198
cleaning solution is actually doing its

2197
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,760
job for the tools

2198
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:25,039
does that does that 10 minutes also work

2199
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,079
for

2200
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:31,279
using the isopropyl or ethanol solution

2201
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:33,679
so it's interesting so uh speaking from

2202
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:35,840
i know not a growing side but in the

2203
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,920
laboratory when i'm doing anything like

2204
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,719
very sterile or if i'm putting isolates

2205
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:44,000
into long-term storage you know i do let

2206
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:45,679
my scalpels and my my metal tool sit in

2207
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,679
uh alcohol

2208
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:50,480
for for at least 10 minutes just to be

2209
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:53,039
safe and then i'll flame them however i

2210
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:54,959
understand that uh i haven't seen this a

2211
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:56,719
lot within growing operations i know

2212
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,640
definitely the contact time for the 10

2213
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,600
bleach is very important but it's really

2214
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,640
up to you

2215
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,320
um

2216
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,480
again my preference i would say i'd want

2217
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,000
to fully at least submerge them

2218
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:08,479
but i don't

2219
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,719
i don't think that it's necessary for

2220
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:12,638
that that 10 minute contact time with

2221
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,560
the isopropyl uh

2222
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:16,639
alcohol so let's get really specific

2223
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,000
because you know i am usually using

2224
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:20,319
either

2225
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
isopropyl alcohol or ethanol because as

2226
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:25,359
a cannabis enthusiast these are things i

2227
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,359
have a lot of in my life around

2228
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:32,158
and normally i would have a washcloth

2229
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:34,799
that has got some isopropyl or ethanol

2230
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:35,759
on it and i will simply

2231
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,159
wipe

2232
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:42,960
the scissors on the four blade sides

2233
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:44,719
and just call it good i am thinking at

2234
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,480
this point that that's not enough

2235
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,920
contact time

2236
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:49,439
well it's not just that but you're not

2237
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,199
truly like so if you're just kind of

2238
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:53,279
wiping the blades of the scissors like

2239
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:56,079
that the scissors may have other parts

2240
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:58,319
of it that haven't gotten

2241
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:00,158
exposed to the alcohol that now you're

2242
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:02,158
clipping and you know it could be a

2243
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:05,359
source of contamination

2244
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,960
so just to totally eliminate that uh

2245
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:09,439
you know in my opinion i i think

2246
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,119
spraying can be effective but you know

2247
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,799
also submerging the tools and the

2248
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,880
alcohol can also be effective just to

2249
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,560
make sure that you're covering all parts

2250
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,400
of the tools

2251
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,920
so so

2252
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:21,359
i'm trying to think of the best practice

2253
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:25,119
for this because

2254
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:28,158
um you know putting all of my tools into

2255
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:30,399
a bath at the end of the day and walking

2256
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:33,679
away and even leaving them overnight

2257
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:36,479
like that sounds like easy squeezy but

2258
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:39,440
i'm also using those scissors on

2259
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:41,119
multiple plants during the day and i'm

2260
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:44,238
pretty sure you're gonna tell me that

2261
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:46,238
there should be some amount of cleaning

2262
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:48,718
before i go plant to plant because

2263
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:51,839
that's how i spread infection right

2264
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:53,840
you should yeah i mean

2265
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,000
if you especially if you've been having

2266
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,279
issues with disease in the past and you

2267
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,880
just like want to be very sure i know

2268
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:03,359
within uh the apple and pear industry

2269
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,279
they i mean that they

2270
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:07,198
plant a plant i mean five minutes

2271
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:09,279
soaking between plant to plant like it

2272
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:11,599
it's pretty serious within that industry

2273
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:12,639
so yeah you could also uh take a page

2274
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,239
out of

2275
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:17,920
what other crop producers um or other

2276
01:22:16,238 --> 01:22:21,039
yeah pretty much other crop producers do

2277
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:23,520
and other growers do uh by you know you

2278
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:25,519
could have multiple shears in a jar of

2279
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,960
ethanol and you know kind of rotate them

2280
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,040
out as you go plant a plant so you're

2281
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,198
not waiting forever

2282
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,479
or you know i like that that's that's a

2283
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:34,719
pretty good best practice because like

2284
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:37,678
one thing that we cannabis growers have

2285
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:39,520
are lots of freaking scissors right like

2286
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,039
because we go through them and and you

2287
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,920
know we're all trimming at the end of

2288
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:45,519
the season and so i probably got 17 pair

2289
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,079
you know the hardest part would just be

2290
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:50,560
finding them all at the same time but

2291
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:53,840
but i like the idea of if i'm if i'm

2292
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,920
going down the row and trimming all of

2293
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,679
the plants of everything that's necrotic

2294
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,960
or unnecessary or big leafing or

2295
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:04,000
whatever to to have like you know six or

2296
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,319
seven pairs in a bath and just work my

2297
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,920
way down the line and use a pair of

2298
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:09,359
scissors and put them in the back and

2299
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,000
then grab the next pair for the next

2300
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,359
plant and by the time i get to the first

2301
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,760
pair again

2302
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:17,839
they will well have been have the

2303
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,119
contact time that they need

2304
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,880
yeah yeah

2305
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,198
and uh and you know better to be safe

2306
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,119
than sorry too so it might seem like

2307
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,719
overkill but you know

2308
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:28,158
if you're not getting disease then at

2309
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:29,439
least you know

2310
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:30,559
it's a good pat on the back where it's

2311
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:33,519
like oh well

2312
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,560
this might seem really excessive but i

2313
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,840
really don't want to get diseased

2314
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,520
because then once i have it there's no

2315
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,920
way to control it yeah i would say that

2316
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:42,080
that's a no-brainer yes to anybody who

2317
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,239
is scaled for sure because you've got a

2318
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:47,198
lot of room for loss but then also

2319
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:48,799
anybody who's not scaled because

2320
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:51,439
like in the example earlier if you've

2321
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,360
only got five plants one of the benefits

2322
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:57,198
is that you can go slow and you can

2323
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:58,719
scout every day and you know you can

2324
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,119
you know do do

2325
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:03,920
soaks like this because every plant is

2326
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:07,039
precious so whether every plant is

2327
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:09,520
precious or you've got a lot to lose

2328
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:11,679
from sheer numbers it really does sound

2329
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,159
like a best practice for anybody who's

2330
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:15,520
actually just a conscientious grower

2331
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:17,839
right and i would also say you know it

2332
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:20,159
doesn't just stop with uh pruners and

2333
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:22,159
shears you could also if you're reusing

2334
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:24,079
a bunch of pots like even spraying down

2335
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:26,238
those pots and getting all the loose

2336
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:28,639
soil out and just really starting clean

2337
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:30,638
with um with with everything that you're

2338
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:33,039
using within the production

2339
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:34,560
is also a pretty good idea as well so do

2340
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:36,399
you mean like spray down the pots with

2341
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:39,440
like isopropyl

2342
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:41,599
yeah you could do that 10 bleach uh yeah

2343
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,519
let them but make sure you let them dry

2344
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,239
before you know you put soil in sure

2345
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:48,960
sure uh but yeah like just another way

2346
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:51,198
uh you know i'm sure you you reuse like

2347
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,880
seedling trays or i'm sure that's true

2348
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:54,719
y'all don't do stuff from seedling but

2349
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,960
you know where you put your cuttings or

2350
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,560
just any type of plastics is a good way

2351
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,719
to put it uh pots and things like that

2352
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,120
that you keep reusing yeah that also it

2353
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:04,079
does not hurt to uh

2354
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:06,559
to get

2355
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:09,119
you know empty them out kind of kind of

2356
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,039
brush them out get all that uh like any

2357
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,800
like you know roots that may have been

2358
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:14,399
in there get them out of there any like

2359
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,800
old soil

2360
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:18,960
you could even do a dip within the 10

2361
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,320
bleach let them dry somewhere and then

2362
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,399
once they're dry they're ready to go and

2363
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:23,759
you've got clean pots that you can reuse

2364
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:25,679
uh it's a good

2365
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:30,239
a good um

2366
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:31,600
sanitation procedure right on so um

2367
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:35,198
so

2368
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:37,440
i'd like you to speak briefly to

2369
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:39,439
the other cross-contamination that

2370
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,439
you've just kind of alluded to a couple

2371
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:43,198
times and so i'm gonna give you just a

2372
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:45,439
couple data points and then just kind of

2373
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:47,759
let you run with it one

2374
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:49,599
is that um

2375
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,119
you know you mentioned how

2376
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,679
the

2377
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:55,840
you can get an infection from pot to pot

2378
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,079
and so i would like to know what the

2379
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,480
mechanism for that is and then you

2380
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:03,359
mentioned you know stuff getting on your

2381
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:04,559
shoes and the floor and so it sounds

2382
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:06,639
like

2383
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,719
we need to be careful with pot to pot

2384
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:10,239
prevention and then also

2385
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,399
you know literally maybe maybe we're

2386
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:14,799
even using a 10 bleach solution on the

2387
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:15,759
floor so so kind of speak to that if you

2388
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,760
would

2389
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,760
yes so

2390
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,000
so it's it it's easier so say you're

2391
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,800
growing kind of worn an indoor silly it

2392
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,520
can be a little easier to sanitize uh

2393
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,279
surfaces as you will with um you know

2394
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,639
ten percent bleach or you know i don't

2395
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:32,960
know how big the operation a lot of

2396
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:35,119
commercial growers will use xeritol or

2397
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,600
sanidate some of these oxidizers that

2398
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:39,599
can really cyst open and kill infecting

2399
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,719
tropicals um really efficient on

2400
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,719
surfaces

2401
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:44,560
uh so so that's one

2402
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:47,359
and you don't want like excessive

2403
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,880
splashing going on everywhere uh and

2404
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:50,319
yeah if you have debris on your floor

2405
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,319
again like you really want to get rid of

2406
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:54,559
all that plant debris that soil debris

2407
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:55,920
root debris that may fall out from

2408
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,600
plants that you've harvested and you're

2409
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,960
trying to get rid of

2410
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,800
because yeah those you know we talked

2411
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,439
about earlier how these

2412
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:06,239
pathogens can survive and you know

2413
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:08,960
decaying tissue and soil uh and just

2414
01:27:06,238 --> 01:27:10,479
kind of stay dormant so so it

2415
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,639
it's easy to spread that around when

2416
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:14,718
it's just kind of sitting on the floor

2417
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:16,319
sitting on your bench and it's not and

2418
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:18,239
it's just sitting there and not getting

2419
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:21,279
swept up taken care of putting in the

2420
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:23,759
trash and uh even after you sweep up

2421
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:26,000
it's a good practice to you know even

2422
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,320
sanitize those floors sanitize those

2423
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,119
benches uh if you have a canopy you know

2424
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:33,279
like cleaning that canopy um off every

2425
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:35,119
now and then uh can can really help

2426
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:37,920
again like your your whole goal is to

2427
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:40,079
lower the contamination is to lower

2428
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,119
these pathogen populations within your

2429
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:42,399
growing

2430
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:44,079
operation

2431
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:45,839
what do you specifically mean by

2432
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:47,359
splashing that's kind of that word seems

2433
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,880
kind of out of context

2434
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:50,639
so splashing

2435
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,880
there's multiple ways you can splash so

2436
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:55,039
a lot of people uh within cannabis

2437
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,719
industry that i've personally seen i

2438
01:27:55,039 --> 01:28:00,600
don't know if it's for everyone uh does

2439
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,600
a lot of hand irrigation

2440
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,600
and so within other crop um production

2441
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,600
at a higher scale a lot of drip

2442
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,440
irrigation to avoid the splashing that

2443
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:12,159
i'm talking about

2444
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:13,599
because say

2445
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:15,679
say i have

2446
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,520
a bunch of debris or i've got debris

2447
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,119
somewhere and now you know i'm i'm

2448
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,719
splashing everywhere and the water is

2449
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:22,960
getting on the floor and it's you know

2450
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:24,880
you don't want anything to splash into

2451
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:28,079
your uh your healthy like you know

2452
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:30,319
uncontaminated soil um from a potential

2453
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:31,920
contamination source so that's one and

2454
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:33,439
also you know with boots like you can

2455
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,359
get things on your boots and then you're

2456
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:37,519
walking around in the water and then you

2457
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:39,279
know say you've got multiple stages one

2458
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,920
thing that i really want to stress is

2459
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:44,238
you don't want to go trudging around and

2460
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:47,359
uh say you've got a section where you

2461
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:48,959
have more mature plants older plants uh

2462
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:51,599
and there's a lot of soil and you know

2463
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,039
you're working within that um

2464
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,719
you know you're irrigating your boots

2465
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:57,039
are all muddy what have you and then you

2466
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:59,198
go into your cutting or you know younger

2467
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:01,119
tissue seedling bay you really want to

2468
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:02,879
make sure that that stays really clean

2469
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:05,119
because those young

2470
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,880
uh cannabis plants are a lot more

2471
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:08,960
susceptible to these diseases so like

2472
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,119
even at you know a lower population they

2473
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,760
could they could be compromised and get

2474
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:16,079
an infection so you you want to be

2475
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,119
careful of how you're even contaminating

2476
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:19,840
um

2477
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:22,479
you know bay to bay or or you know

2478
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,239
garden to garden you know bringing any

2479
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:26,319
soil and and really bringing

2480
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:28,559
contaminants with you in different

2481
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:30,799
sections uh wherever you're growing as

2482
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,000
well uh so it's something to really keep

2483
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,320
in mind

2484
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,920
uh and even like cleaning your boots off

2485
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:37,599
you know that's a yeah you get into the

2486
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,279
habit of it spraying them down after

2487
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:42,560
each day and

2488
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:44,880
and uh yeah i am so guilty of that

2489
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,800
splashing from hand watering i had not

2490
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,159
even ever considered that because i am

2491
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,880
one of those people

2492
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:53,279
that hand waters from a hose with a

2493
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:56,480
water wand on the end

2494
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:58,000
and i just go plant to plant and

2495
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:00,319
you know so long as the soil isn't

2496
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,039
hydrophobic it will

2497
01:30:00,319 --> 01:30:04,880
almost immediately soak into the soil

2498
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:07,279
but there is a moment there that it does

2499
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,199
kind of collect on the top and and i'm

2500
01:30:07,279 --> 01:30:12,000
doing you know using the rain setting

2501
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:14,319
and so there's all these micro splashes

2502
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,158
and it's probably aerosolizing all sorts

2503
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,439
of stuff from the top of the pot

2504
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:19,359
that is

2505
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:22,479
you know very likely going to be spread

2506
01:30:19,359 --> 01:30:22,479
to the nearby plants

2507
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:30,079
yeah that's me so all right um all right

2508
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:31,679
so uh sorry so so before we move on from

2509
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:35,039
like cleaning stuff is there is there

2510
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:37,199
anything that i have missed that that uh

2511
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:39,600
i should ask

2512
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:41,039
um i think we've covered a lot of it uh

2513
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,520
you always want to inspect your new

2514
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:45,119
plant material like i said you know the

2515
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,320
youngest plant materials super

2516
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:50,399
susceptible to these diseases um and i

2517
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:52,079
know you t you know if you take cuttings

2518
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:53,759
from mother plants you always want to

2519
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:55,359
inspect that mother plant i know within

2520
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,960
commercial

2521
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:58,479
facilities they don't they don't want to

2522
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,639
keep a mother plant for more than two

2523
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:02,718
months uh they always want to be

2524
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,079
starting with uh really clean plants

2525
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,439
because you know it really starts in the

2526
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:07,679
beginning you want to start with healthy

2527
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:08,638
plants and end with healthy plants and

2528
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:09,920
um

2529
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:12,480
and yeah just make sure you get all that

2530
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,079
debris off the ground you're not

2531
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:16,718
you know bringing contaminants from one

2532
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:19,198
field to another field

2533
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:21,119
and you're properly sanitizing your

2534
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:23,279
tools and all the equipment that you're

2535
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:25,840
using to grow again just as another

2536
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:27,840
safety net as that prevention umbrella

2537
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,279
we've been talking about

2538
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,440
so

2539
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:34,319
sort of really help your your grow right

2540
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:35,919
be the most successful you can

2541
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:40,000
the same team we all just want the

2542
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:42,079
plants to be uh as happy and as as uh

2543
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,238
healthy as they can be so just putting

2544
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:46,079
these things into place it it seems like

2545
01:31:44,238 --> 01:31:48,799
a pain but it always pays off when you

2546
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:50,639
don't have disease issues uh so it's all

2547
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:53,199
good practices to keep in mind right on

2548
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,960
now see that is such a great summary

2549
01:31:53,198 --> 01:31:57,198
right now would be a great time for me

2550
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,639
to like wrap up the show and thank you

2551
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:00,960
and everything but there's one more

2552
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,079
question that i want to ask you

2553
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,560
um

2554
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,000
when you and i were first on the phone

2555
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,600
and talking about whether or not we

2556
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
thought this was going to be

2557
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:12,400
an episode we wanted to do together

2558
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,600
you said something in passing that

2559
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:15,920
totally

2560
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,679
you know got my attention and and i

2561
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,480
wanted to ask you about it and

2562
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:20,560
and

2563
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:23,119
you were talking about your research

2564
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,600
there at university of connecticut

2565
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:28,479
and you were all excited because you

2566
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:30,800
said that you had just killed a whole

2567
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:33,439
greenhouse of cannabis for research and

2568
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:35,360
you were all excited about it and so

2569
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:38,000
like would you tell us the story like

2570
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:40,079
why why did you kill an entire

2571
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,679
greenhouse of cannabis and why were you

2572
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:43,760
thrilled about it

2573
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:45,359
that's a total like if there's like any

2574
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,119
plant pathologist listening they're like

2575
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:48,639
uh yeah it's like we only feel that way

2576
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:51,679
it's like when we see sick plants we

2577
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:51,679
like get really excited

2578
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,039
so i want to give a little context so at

2579
01:32:53,679 --> 01:33:00,158
uconn i i predominantly study

2580
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:01,760
uh root pathogens within leafy greens or

2581
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:03,279
vegetable crops that's that's what i

2582
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,360
focus on however

2583
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:06,880
since the doors have really opened for

2584
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:09,119
cannabis and not a lot of people have

2585
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:12,239
been working on it we had gone to a

2586
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:13,679
commercial facility in 2019 and they had

2587
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:15,359
symptomatic plants with the same

2588
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:17,520
symptoms that we've just covered in this

2589
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:19,519
show reduced growth yellow tissue they

2590
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,120
even had one plant that fully wilted

2591
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,400
that they bagged and was like trying to

2592
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:26,719
get it out of there

2593
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:28,719
um and at uconn at any research facility

2594
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:31,198
we can't take the tissue so i wasn't

2595
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:33,679
allowed to actually take the roots and

2596
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,439
take uh any in the infecting tissue so i

2597
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:37,199
took because these are cannabis plants

2598
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:39,119
to be clear these are not leafy greens

2599
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:40,158
you got to go to a commercial cannabis

2600
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:41,920
facility

2601
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:44,319
yes yes so

2602
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:47,039
right thank you for clearing that up so

2603
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:48,479
so we had gone to a cannabis facility

2604
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:50,560
because they're you know having some

2605
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:53,919
issues we're just checking it out

2606
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:56,480
and we ended up taking the

2607
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:58,239
they were growing mature cannabis plants

2608
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:00,959
in coconut core

2609
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:03,279
uh so we had taken the coconut core

2610
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,719
surrounding the roots of all the

2611
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:07,679
symptomatic plants brought them back to

2612
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:11,520
the lab well um we had actually ended up

2613
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:13,679
getting 26 uh organisms

2614
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,360
uh wow that sounds like a lot it was

2615
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,719
yeah it was a lot we did serial dilution

2616
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:18,238
plating some people can get like more

2617
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:21,520
but we had collected from a good bit of

2618
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:23,439
plants so within that uh fast forward so

2619
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:26,719
we had identified them morphologically

2620
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:28,879
and molecularly we got 21 of those

2621
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:30,480
isolates where pithier mario tilum the

2622
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:33,679
one that i spoke about earlier that's

2623
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:36,638
very sev causes very severe uh symptoms

2624
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:39,760
within cannabis and we've seen that

2625
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:41,760
and then three were this globosporangium

2626
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,199
irregular that was formally the pythium

2627
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,520
irregular

2628
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:48,559
and then one was a fusarium oxisporum

2629
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:49,920
that we actually got from a cutting uh

2630
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,039
in rockwool

2631
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,199
so

2632
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:55,519
so fast forward we've got these isolates

2633
01:34:53,198 --> 01:34:58,238
and as a plant pathologist in order to

2634
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,800
actually publish and be confident about

2635
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:03,118
our findings that these organisms were

2636
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,199
the ones that were causing the symptoms

2637
01:35:03,118 --> 01:35:07,519
within these plants it we have to do

2638
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:09,118
what's called coke's postulates

2639
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:11,119
so we have to

2640
01:35:09,118 --> 01:35:14,399
isolate those organisms and then we have

2641
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:16,639
to reinfect the same crop

2642
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:18,399
with those isolates

2643
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:20,480
separately so we can see the effect of

2644
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:23,279
each one of these isolates

2645
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:26,879
on the cannabis plants to see

2646
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:28,319
if they cause disease and they caused a

2647
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,400
lot of disease and i mean i've been

2648
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:32,799
working with root pathogens for about

2649
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:35,759
six years now and i i really haven't

2650
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:37,199
seen this type of virulence or severity

2651
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,159
within um

2652
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:42,559
within seedlings uh as much as i have

2653
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:45,118
with cannabis uh when i had

2654
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:47,280
introduced these pythiums that i had

2655
01:35:45,118 --> 01:35:48,559
gotten from the facility so uh just to

2656
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:50,559
kind of wrap it up

2657
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:53,199
we had a whole greenhouse with a

2658
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,639
thousand cannabis plants and they were

2659
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:56,479
uh

2660
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:59,199
i inoculated them

2661
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:02,319
at two weeks old after i'd grown them

2662
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:03,839
from seed so so they're pretty young and

2663
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:06,158
and they were growing pretty well and

2664
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,039
then we'd inoculate them

2665
01:36:06,158 --> 01:36:08,960
uh

2666
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:10,639
how tall were they i want to say

2667
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,198
i want to say they grew to about a foot

2668
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:14,639
so these are about foot uh kind of young

2669
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:17,359
cannabis plants and we got about a

2670
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:19,760
thousand of them and all of the 21

2671
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,679
pythium meriotilum isolates that we had

2672
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:24,480
gotten from that facility that we

2673
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:26,399
introduced back on to healthy uh we

2674
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:28,158
couldn't do marijuana plants those hemp

2675
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:30,399
plants

2676
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:33,519
all of them went down i mean chlorosis

2677
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:35,759
they all wilted uh only you know

2678
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:38,480
some as soon as a couple days after that

2679
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,000
pythium was introduced to them uh so it

2680
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:41,678
really showed

2681
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,118
wow yes these

2682
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:46,158
these pythiums that we got from the

2683
01:36:43,118 --> 01:36:48,079
facility um are very pathogenic

2684
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:50,399
pathogenic uh

2685
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:53,359
to cannabis and and cause high virulence

2686
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:55,359
or high severity when we put them back

2687
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:57,759
on the plants so then as you know as

2688
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:59,439
scientists it's like okay so now

2689
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,119
now we're going to report it so you

2690
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:02,559
can't just take a disease from a plant

2691
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:05,039
and be like okay it causes disease you

2692
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:07,440
know you have to like i said uh make it

2693
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:08,880
happen yes you have to prove you have to

2694
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:10,000
like i didn't just randomly get this

2695
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,760
organism

2696
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,560
you have to prove that can actually

2697
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:17,360
cause uh symptoms and infection on the

2698
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,719
plant that you got it from so yeah

2699
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:21,519
i guess it was very

2700
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:23,600
exciting because like i said i i

2701
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,199
cannabis is very susceptible to pythium

2702
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:28,159
and that just kind of opened our eyes to

2703
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:29,839
like wow like research really you know

2704
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:31,839
it's exciting because i'm sure there's

2705
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,360
going to be a lot more research projects

2706
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:36,000
and opportunities coming up to help

2707
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:38,639
these growers and help everyone

2708
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,079
really not only identify but help

2709
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:41,600
control and the things you're talking

2710
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:43,118
about and understanding more about it

2711
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,800
because it seems

2712
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:46,799
uh you know i always i work with

2713
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,480
poinsettias a lot too within our lab we

2714
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,320
do some with ornamental growers and

2715
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:51,759
poinsettia is like really susceptible to

2716
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:53,759
pithium as well it's you know if you

2717
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,000
talk to any growers who grow poinsettias

2718
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,679
as it is a big pathogen they look out

2719
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,679
for and i'm like like cannabis is the

2720
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:01,679
next poinsettia when it comes to pythium

2721
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:03,840
because uh because pythium's pretty

2722
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:06,079
severe on it so um

2723
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,840
right on well i appreciate you sharing

2724
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:10,079
that story and you know uh you know

2725
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,840
props to university of connecticut for

2726
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:14,319
doing whatever

2727
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:17,039
legal like hoops they had to jump

2728
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:19,519
through in order to be able to do

2729
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:22,000
you know uh cannabis research whether

2730
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,199
it's hemp or type one is is you know

2731
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,279
doesn't matter because it's the same

2732
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:28,399
plant it's just nice to know that we've

2733
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:31,279
got university ag departments working on

2734
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:33,359
our side now and that and that people

2735
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:35,359
like you are doing that kind of work and

2736
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:38,479
killing thousands of plants

2737
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:40,158
so that we can all the rest of us

2738
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:41,919
learn best practice

2739
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:44,238
so so shout out to university of

2740
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,719
connecticut for that and and i so i

2741
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:48,879
guess in in wrapping up thank you also

2742
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:51,760
to you cora for for joining me here on

2743
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:54,480
shaping fire and sharing your experience

2744
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:57,119
you know you've um since you work with

2745
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,319
us on a daily basis in a university

2746
01:38:57,118 --> 01:39:01,198
setting and you know you're getting

2747
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:04,000
ready to defend your own phd

2748
01:39:01,198 --> 01:39:06,638
it's really nice to have somebody who

2749
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,279
has got such specific examples and

2750
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:10,880
easily accessed metaphors and knowledge

2751
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:13,118
where you can go right to the point

2752
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:15,520
instead of dancing around it so thank

2753
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:17,839
you so much for coming on the show and

2754
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,760
uh and sharing your expertise

2755
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,920
thank you for having me it's been very

2756
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:24,560
fun and you've been all so awesome

2757
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:28,000
shango and just it's been a pleasure

2758
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:30,400
excellent so if you want to learn more

2759
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,840
about uh different molds and how they

2760
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:34,319
involve with the cannabis plant i

2761
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:37,360
recommend that you go back and check out

2762
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:40,000
episode 28 of shaping fire which is all

2763
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:41,920
about botrytis and powdery mildew in

2764
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,520
scientific detail

2765
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:47,920
with kevin mckiernan and that is a bit

2766
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:50,239
more of a genetic approach than this

2767
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,960
show was which was more about usability

2768
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:54,718
and best practices but uh oh my goodness

2769
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,960
you will know a lot more about botrytis

2770
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:59,520
and powdery mildew after that show

2771
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:03,359
from a genetic level and best practices

2772
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:05,840
to uh to try to control it and um and if

2773
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:08,559
you have enjoyed uh cora and you wanna

2774
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:11,840
keep up with her and her exploits in the

2775
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:14,880
lab um you can follow cora on her

2776
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:16,319
instagram and that is cora mcgee with an

2777
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,520
