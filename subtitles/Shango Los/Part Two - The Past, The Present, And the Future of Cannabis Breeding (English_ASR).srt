1
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,679
hi there friends

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,878
shango here from shaping fire with part

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,279
two of the segre

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,119
international cannabis breeding panel

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,320
that i went and asked them for after

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,160
seeing it um

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,759
i watched it as a web streaming thing

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,278
and i and it was so good that i i

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,199
reached out to him i said hey can i

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,320
can i have this for the shaping fire

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,439
audience because they'd want to see it

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,118
as well and they're like sure we'd be

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,719
honored that'd be cool so here we are

14
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,160
and so if you missed part one i

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,079
recommend that you check that out

16
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,079
um they are kind of nice to watch and

17
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,439
order um because it gives you more of a

18
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,558
historical timeline

19
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
but really you don't have to if you

20
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,039
don't want to go click to the other one

21
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,960
just watch this one

22
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,320
it talks about different topics and is

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,558
also really great

24
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,640
um so the official title for it is the

25
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,238
past the present and the future of

26
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,480
cannabis breeding part

27
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,679
two and the panelists are mostly the

28
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,799
same uh same

29
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,600
uh top top-notch premium folks uh in uh

30
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,279
ryan lee

31
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
that most of us know as the breeder

32
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,198
chimera

33
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,600
rob clark who's the godfather of

34
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,679
cannabis taxonomy and botany

35
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,359
mark lewis of napro research whose

36
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,920
cultivars keep on winning emerald cup

37
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,680
awards

38
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,680
and then mojave richmond from bio

39
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,360
agronomics group who's new to me but

40
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
adds a lot of real good value to this

41
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,478
panel and and all these folks are just

42
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,519
really top-notch

43
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:18,560
and hard to like get you know um so

44
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,599
uh the the topics on both have all been

45
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,960
cannabis breeding

46
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,399
but specifically what we're gonna talk

47
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,839
about in or what they're gonna talk

48
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,640
about in this episode

49
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,040
is modern breeding technology modern

50
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,400
breeding innovations like autoflowers

51
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,680
and polyploidy

52
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,359
and then what the contempt competitive

53
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,920
landscape is right now

54
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,879
in um in breeding so it's all great

55
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,000
stuff i hope you enjoy it and here we go

56
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,118
so um our panel today again for part two

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
we've got a great

58
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,159
group of guys here to chat with you

59
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,359
today we have michael williamson

60
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,799
from uh catalyst bc and also allele

61
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,840
genetics

62
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
we have ryan lee with us from kim of our

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
corporation

64
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,839
rob clark and mojave both from bio

65
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
agronomic group

66
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,439
and then mark lewis joining us from

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,639
napro research and the biotech institute

68
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,400
and i think we've got some good

69
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,598
geography covered today we've got

70
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,120
michael in florida

71
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,878
ryan and bc rob in sweden

72
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,039
and then mark and mojave and myself down

73
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,959
here in california so

74
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,639
all right so with that i'm going to turn

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,159
it over to michael and he's going to

76
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,000
take this away for us

77
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,680
all right good afternoon or good morning

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,919
or good evening wherever you may be

79
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,120
thanks for joining us uh let's jump into

80
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,878
it so

81
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
um the first question that we're going

82
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,399
to be tackling today is

83
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,479
how will cannabis plant breeding

84
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,879
objectives evolve as the industry

85
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,318
matures

86
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,399
you know we're interested in kind of

87
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,518
exploring

88
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
concepts around trait optimization as

89
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,680
well as

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
things like pathogen resistance

91
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,519
mark you want to kick us off there

92
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
or ryan

93
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:12,479
i guess this sounds good

94
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
sorry about that um i guess to know

95
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,399
where we're going we kind of need to

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,199
know where we've been and be really cool

97
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,039
if

98
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,318
we could just take like two minutes and

99
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,719
have rob

100
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,759
kind of talk about what they used to

101
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,878
trait optimize

102
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,798
for in these land race varieties

103
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,840
and then we can kind of spring off from

104
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,439
there and talk about what we're

105
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,519
optimizing for now

106
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,000
well i think from the point of view of

107
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,920
traditional farmers who develop

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,239
land races land races being

109
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,318
geographically limited and culturally

110
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,000
limited varieties of plants

111
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:53,359
and animals for that matter that were

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,959
evolved um within a certain

113
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,680
environmental context

114
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
and within a certain cultural context so

115
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
it was the

116
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,560
in physical environment the weather

117
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,000
where where plants

118
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,400
lived every year and combined with

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
what the farmers wanted from those

120
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
plants

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,759
so basically what land races were were

122
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,160
survivors

123
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,279
there was nobody out there looking for a

124
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,880
particular

125
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:24,000
trait it was a balance

126
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:26,240
it was an evolutionary balance that

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,800
manifested itself every year

128
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,160
through the planting of seeds that were

129
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,759
sexually reproduced

130
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,080
from a male and a female plant in the

131
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,120
case of cannabis

132
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:40,399
and those uh so

133
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,199
so there wasn't the searching for traits

134
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,478
like we do

135
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,240
now it was an ecological balance

136
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,000
that came between a farmer and the

137
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,800
environment and the

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,319
interests that the cultures had in those

139
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,000
local plants

140
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,439
so now we changed everything immensely

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,478
but those are the building blocks we

142
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,800
started with

143
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:03,038
and that's where we'll go on from today

144
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,600
yeah i think that that's good but you

145
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,478
think about grain size in the hemp plant

146
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,840
if they're being grown for seed you know

147
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,199
every year you picked that plant that

148
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,478
had the biggest seed and you sprout that

149
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,560
biggest seed so that

150
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,680
you know you're optimizing that that

151
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,280
fruit size

152
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,639
uh trait um and then you have in corn

153
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,000
it's drought tolerance

154
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,759
of course and and nowadays in

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,319
cannabis it's you know you either got

156
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,439
the fiber which you don't want branching

157
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,639
they you know long

158
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:39,120
stalks um the big seed

159
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,800
for your grain crop and then big focus

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,519
now is chemical optimization you got

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,639
hemp trying to reduce the amount of thc

162
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,758
below

163
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,759
federal guidelines while

164
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,280
creating metabolite concentrations of

165
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,720
other cannabinoids

166
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,439
in the you know height 18s and 20s

167
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,840
so you can efficiently extract a large

168
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,719
amount

169
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,839
of metabolite to be used as a

170
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,280
therapeutic somehow

171
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,879
um the next iteration of this i'm sure

172
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,318
we'll get more specific for

173
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,600
different processes and methods of

174
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,039
extraction

175
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,479
i.e water hash or

176
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,439
sieve filtration be by trichome head

177
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,879
size

178
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,478
um color mojave you know you

179
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,079
you always talk about purple flowers

180
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,240
right

181
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,279
you know any any good examples of

182
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,759
someone optimizing that purple trait

183
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,799
yeah well purple is purple is a highly

184
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,600
marketable trait

185
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
um i would just add that you know in

186
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
that

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,680
land race selection period of finding

188
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
those survivors

189
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,120
that there was a lot of um because

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,720
everything was so isolated there was

191
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,399
not necessarily a selection towards a

192
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,720
chemical profile but there were certain

193
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,560
chemical profiles that survived

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,160
and all throughout the world in those

195
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,959
isolated regions we had

196
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,280
a lot of diversity in the various

197
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,478
compounds that the plant was producing

198
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,079
um so that's you know in as we move

199
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,478
forward we have to kind of look back to

200
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,399
the past before this hybridization event

201
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,159
that happened over the past you know 30

202
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,198
40 50 years

203
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,080
and start to explore how those um

204
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,478
chemical profiles those chemo bars were

205
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,560
were

206
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,839
um established within those land races

207
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,918
and how they

208
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,399
facilitated certain needs for that

209
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,318
particular population that region

210
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,239
um those various traits that were kind

211
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,319
of isolated

212
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,918
but yeah purple purple i mean my thing

213
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,319
with purple isn't so much

214
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,159
you know i'm it's just that it's funny

215
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,000
that color has become such a powerful

216
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,120
marketing tool especially here

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,240
on the west coast um that kind of goes

218
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,759
beyond

219
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,918
the effect of the plant it's just

220
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,919
it's such a powerful tool color and

221
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,119
smell

222
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,120
path is a pathogen resistance would

223
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,160
probably be uh

224
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,918
obviously the next attack for trade

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,240
optimization

226
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:14,719
i know ian likes to talk about that a

227
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
lot um if he's got anything on the

228
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,279
yeah i mean the way i look because from

229
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,079
a plant-breeding perspective is that

230
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,799
like

231
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,560
any trait exists on a continuum i know

232
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,400
i've said i think i said on the last one

233
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,759
but you know you can have small plants

234
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,598
or tall plants or

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,200
low yielding plants or high yielding

236
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,120
plants or same with cannabinoid and

237
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,599
terpene content you can have

238
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,120
low expressors and high expressors so

239
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,158
when you when you look at any trait

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,320
there's this continuum of performance

241
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,080
um that we see and in cannabis

242
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
especially like i think even much more

243
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
than

244
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
a lot of other plants because of the way

245
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,240
that it naturally evolved

246
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,839
it has all this built-in variation

247
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,959
um that we can you know we can take

248
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,560
advantage of as

249
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,679
as plant readers unfortunately one of

250
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,199
the things that we did over the last

251
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,719
kind of 20 years

252
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,160
is just reshuffled all these

253
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,000
different decks from all over the world

254
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,799
and intermixed them and kind of ended up

255
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,600
with like

256
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,399
you know this big colorful mess of of

257
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,639
genes

258
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,679
uh which in some instances has been good

259
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,600
but

260
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,278
it really hasn't allowed us to like mark

261
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,159
saying and optimize some of these traits

262
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,838
are like

263
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,759
you know push the most of

264
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,360
any given trait that we can see or even

265
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,799
in some cases create

266
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,800
you know what's called transgressive

267
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,000
segger against like plants that are

268
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,838
even farther out than you know the

269
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
limits that we've seen before in terms

270
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,680
of you know any trait

271
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:47,120
yield smell or whatever um

272
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:51,838
and so yeah you know there

273
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,839
there's a lot that we can do the

274
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,839
this plant but we definitely have to

275
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,120
create more inbred lines and

276
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,040
and you know some of the kinks that

277
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,560
we've created into our production plants

278
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:07,679
um things like root architecture or

279
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,639
or root chemical performance or or you

280
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,399
know plant

281
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,000
architecture like mark was talking about

282
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,639
before um

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,078
all these things add up when you're in a

284
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,039
production environment i mean like rob

285
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,799
was saying

286
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,799
you're growing these things the far

287
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,359
these plants came from

288
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,078
farms that were grown from indigenous or

289
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,240
like most

290
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,278
wild farmers are up in the mountains

291
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,959
they weren't being

292
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,519
you know produced in the way that we

293
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,879
grow them either in indoors or in

294
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,879
greenhouses from clone

295
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,120
and so we have a lot of work that we can

296
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,399
do in terms of plant architecture

297
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,078
and structure in terms of just making

298
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,360
the plants easier to grow and harvest

299
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,359
and process

300
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,200
and ryan how far out do you think we are

301
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
from like i don't i was referred to

302
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,640
as like the utopian plant it seems like

303
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,000
you know people come across cultivars

304
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,639
all the time that have

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
one two maybe three really desirable

306
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,958
traits

307
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,959
um you know and they kind of refer that

308
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,518
as like a chexist box it checks that box

309
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,759
but

310
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,959
in terms of like maturation time it

311
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,559
seems like there's always like if it's a

312
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,239
fast flowering cultivar i noticed like

313
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,278
it generally sacrifices yield on the

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,240
back end or something

315
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,639
or it's slower in veg for some reason

316
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,079
but

317
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,679
i guess how far out do you think we are

318
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,838
from having um

319
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,439
through without any kind of gene editing

320
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,360
more of a

321
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,959
a utopian plant that kind of checks

322
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
literally all the boxes and let's say

323
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,399
there's

324
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,399
you know seven of them

325
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,879
yeah okay i almost look at it i'm gonna

326
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,240
answer you in a way that has nothing to

327
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,919
do with what you said

328
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,839
it's like imagine you're like you're

329
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,719
coming into the west coast on a boat and

330
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
you gotta you gotta

331
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,399
trans you gotta go over all the

332
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,240
mountains and end up at the prairies or

333
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,240
end up at the east coast right

334
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,519
so when you start up the hill it's like

335
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,560
you're looking at the top of this

336
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,078
mountain

337
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,799
and you can't see anything beyond the

338
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,319
hill until you get to the top

339
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,519
right and then when you look down on the

340
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,480
other side you can see that there's a

341
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,000
whole mountain range and a whole nother

342
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,360
set of challenges that you have to face

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
and that's kind of the way that i look

344
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,399
at plant breeding

345
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,959
like it's this goal that's never done

346
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,200
you're you're embarking on a project

347
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,199
that

348
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,879
it's never done because plant

349
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,159
bulletproof plants that we're going to

350
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,240
make over the next 20

351
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,439
years you know we're going to come along

352
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,120
and find some flaw

353
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
that we've bred into the plants because

354
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,278
that's just the way that

355
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,078
plant breeding goes right every time you

356
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,000
make it grow

357
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,638
you make a an adjustment to the

358
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,039
performance of some trade

359
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,480
you might have fixed one problem but now

360
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,679
that allows you to see a whole new

361
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,480
problem that you couldn't

362
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,078
see in the plant before so for me like i

363
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,039
don't look at plant breeding in the

364
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,039
in that way

365
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,759
yeah plan never stops right it never

366
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,120
stops it always goes on and on and it's

367
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,399
this funny pitch that i

368
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
you know unfortunately i have to have

369
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,919
with investors because it's like

370
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
they want to understand it's like you

371
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,199
know the the investor mentality is that

372
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,720
you want to hear like if i put in x

373
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,240
amount it's going to return me

374
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,959
you know it's going to give me an roi of

375
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,879
whatever 100 or whatever it is

376
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,958
right and when you tell them that it's

377
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,600
this like ongoing expense that's always

378
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:10,719
going to go

379
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,240
it's painful for some cfos to understand

380
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
when they're thinking of cannabis like

381
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,639
it's a widget

382
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,839
right but the truth is is

383
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,000
that's what trade optimization is about

384
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,279
and

385
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,120
this is one of the key areas

386
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,200
that really hasn't been addressed in my

387
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,120
opinion in the cannabis industry is that

388
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,320
area of true innovation

389
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
right there's all the stuff that you can

390
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,760
do in extraction processes and delivery

391
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,679
methods and

392
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,799
you know sku formats and all that kind

393
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,719
of stuff

394
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:43,599
but it always comes back to the plant

395
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
right and

396
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,959
you know in terms of trade optimization

397
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,240
you know mark's talking about grain size

398
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,000
or

399
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,278
chemical profile and you know these are

400
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,198
important traits of course

401
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,519
but you can essentially you know we

402
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,479
could optimize hemp for

403
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,440
um hemp create production or you know

404
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,680
the the production

405
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,560
they're using it for fiber hemp fibers

406
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,319
for graphene

407
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,719
you could probably breed a variety that

408
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,040
makes really nice graphene right

409
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,879
um as you know as we all know now we can

410
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,039
optimize the cannabinoids the terpene

411
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,759
contents and profiles

412
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,599
um but really any any any trade in the

413
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,799
plant we can optimize for a given

414
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
purpose

415
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,439
so you know once we do seed size maybe

416
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,198
it's seed profile right we start having

417
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,440
different hemp seeds with different

418
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,479
chemical profiles in them as well

419
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,959
um so yeah there's a lot we can do yeah

420
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
i mean well

421
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,879
any name do you name a perfect tomato

422
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,959
plant right now i mean

423
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,919
you go to the store and buy them you

424
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,359
know they're grown

425
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,599
there's a perfect plant for that hot

426
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,000
house or you know for windset farms or

427
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,399
whoever

428
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,480
it is trying to produce a certain amount

429
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,639
by a certain date to make their money

430
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,639
but that's not the most desirable tomato

431
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,560
for say the consumer i mean

432
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,399
there's there's much tastier tomatoes

433
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,399
than the pink hot house ones

434
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,440
right but there's reason that they're

435
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,360
specific

436
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:07,600
for particular you know uh production

437
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,519
schema and continual innovation

438
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,278
all plants potatoes you know what makes

439
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,240
a better chip what makes a better french

440
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,078
fry

441
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
you know all that stuff i think from a

442
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,278
commercial standpoint there's you know

443
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,078
you see it pretty consistently and it's

444
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:19,600
it's

445
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,120
people are there's some leaps and bounds

446
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,879
that need to happen with the plant in

447
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
terms of like labor reduction

448
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,679
um you know there's this kind of

449
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,360
obsession with touching the plant and

450
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,039
manipulating the plant and

451
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,440
um you know it could be things like can

452
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,159
we breed something that has like a

453
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,000
enough turgidity that it doesn't need to

454
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,639
uh be supported by a trellis as an

455
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,879
example

456
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,560
um is there something with like that

457
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:44,000
perfect balance of

458
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,599
uh leaf to calyx ratio um and in some of

459
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
these other kind of areas where

460
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,560
you know especially on the disease

461
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,000
resistant side or pest resistant side

462
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,719
you watch a lot of people just dump

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,879
time and labor into crops um and if we

464
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,759
could get the genetics just a few steps

465
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,360
above

466
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,879
um it would really kind of help out the

467
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,639
farmer

468
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,159
we tend to touch this plant too much it

469
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,240
seems like if we could get some of these

470
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,519
breeding building blocks established

471
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,198
uh maybe we could touch it a little bit

472
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,879
less let the plants kind of do the heavy

473
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,359
lifting for us

474
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,000
and that's what we're saying sorry go

475
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
ahead bobby

476
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,799
all right i was gonna say that that's a

477
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,278
really good point because you know as

478
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,599
mark

479
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,559
brought up you know we can go to our

480
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
local

481
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,879
nursery as hobbyists uh plant growers

482
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,399
and we can you know choose between all

483
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,159
these amazing plant varieties but when

484
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,559
you go to the grocery store

485
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,000
there's only usually a few tomato

486
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,799
varieties to select within

487
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
any one market and that has to do with

488
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,559
optimization

489
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,159
for the farmer for production and i

490
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,638
think that one of our challenges moving

491
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,039
forward

492
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,320
as we're able to to develop these

493
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,919
varieties

494
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,680
is we have to have a starting point like

495
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,838
ryan said got to get over that mountain

496
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,559
before we get to the plateau

497
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,399
and as we're exploring you know marker

498
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,879
assisted breeding or

499
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,198
or triploids or all these new amazing

500
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,799
ways to develop these new varieties

501
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,719
you have to have a starting point which

502
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,319
is what what um

503
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,839
you know what are the base building

504
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,959
blocks that we're going to go on to move

505
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,038
from there

506
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,480
and i think that that one of our

507
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:09,199
challenges that we have in the industry

508
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,078
is that there's

509
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,640
there's um a lot of diversity in the

510
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,798
market

511
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,240
and not as much diversity in the genome

512
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,000
in terms of

513
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,599
colors to choose from and blocks to

514
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,759
choose from so

515
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,438
once that diversity in the market sends

516
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,240
down a little bit similar to

517
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,240
that diversity at the supermarket then

518
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,839
we can really optimize those varieties

519
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,160
for different production techniques

520
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,359
for for different you know for different

521
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,080
traits like

522
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,599
like turgidity and all that stuff so

523
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,240
it's it's really challenging i see you

524
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,558
know like

525
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,919
you know as the the market continues to

526
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,960
shift and the new

527
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,720
strain du jour shows up then that strain

528
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
is now the new starting point and then a

529
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,120
year later there's a new strain that's a

530
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,519
new starting point

531
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,199
variety or cultivar so i think that like

532
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,440
collectively as an industry we kind of

533
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,440
have to search a little bit deeper

534
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,720
into what we want these plants to

535
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,840
produce in terms of

536
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,400
compounds or in terms of products

537
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,000
industrial materials before we can

538
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,440
really start to optimize

539
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,319
their trades well and the problem with

540
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,600
being an innovator is that if you have

541
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,798
these really great products to genetics

542
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,480
to

543
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,119
go to a farmer you're five or ten years

544
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,880
ahead

545
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,639
in your vocabulary and how you speak

546
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,120
about the plants you know you talk about

547
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,038
type one type two type three to a normal

548
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,079
farmer they just kind of shrug

549
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,359
and say how much thc does it produce and

550
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,879
what's the yield

551
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,479
they don't really even care about

552
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,600
terpene profiles right now because

553
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,519
they're not

554
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:43,038
the market hasn't been educated enough

555
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,519
for the level of sophistication to be

556
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,079
high enough to even realize or explore

557
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,038
these

558
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,159
different you know chemotypes that's

559
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:57,839
just the chemo type

560
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:59,440
trait of it as well um

561
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,959
um a lot of these traits that we're

562
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,880
talking about as well

563
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,720
that have kind of been judged you know

564
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,799
especially in the cannabis cup circuits

565
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,798
or

566
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,558
emerald cup or whatever it's all done on

567
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,038
flavor and

568
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,798
perception right and so those are all

569
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,720
important traits that appeal to the

570
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,480
consumer the end consumer

571
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,319
but typically plant breeding especially

572
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,880
plant breeding for agriculture

573
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,439
is done with the the you know the

574
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,000
customer

575
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,720
and client for the breeder is a is the

576
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,599
the grower

577
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,720
right it's not the end consumer um by

578
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,798
corollary the end

579
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,558
consumers is also the customer but

580
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,240
really like the plant breeder serves the

581
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,279
ag industry and not the

582
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
the weed buying public right and so i

583
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,918
think a lot of the

584
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,839
a lot of the breeding that's been done

585
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,840
on the on the small scale with

586
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,000
people making crosses and winning cups

587
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,000
like

588
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
you might end up with some like you know

589
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,440
some special plants that taste pretty

590
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:54,879
good but i i don't think

591
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,720
these are going to be the plants that

592
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,480
are the bulletproof plants that we end

593
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,919
up with in cannabis

594
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,200
right and it kind of brings me to this

595
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,320
concept that i use sometimes

596
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,880
and it's something that we've seen

597
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,439
really of all the last 20 years is

598
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,000
the industry going from like growers

599
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,640
plants

600
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,880
to what i call smokers plants right so

601
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,520
you know og would be a smoker's plan or

602
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,799
a cookies would be a smoker's plant like

603
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,720
everything about the plant in the

604
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,558
essence is really

605
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,319
in those in those plants is guided

606
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,000
towards the consumer

607
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,678
you know they're really finicky to grow

608
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,079
and they have a small yield

609
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,000
but the the smokers really want to have

610
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,240
those plants whereas like

611
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,919
you know something big like the old hash

612
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,679
plants or the

613
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,200
you know the big buzz that all the you

614
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,759
know the biker folks

615
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,440
used to grow back in the 80s and where a

616
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,119
lot of our trash plants kind of came

617
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
from you know the emphasis back then was

618
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,918
on

619
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,558
yield right and so because it was like

620
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,320
any pound

621
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,678
that you could you could go you could

622
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,319
sell for big bucks

623
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,200
it didn't have that level of connoisseur

624
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,960
quality that

625
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,960
that appeals today right and so

626
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,240
that's something that's going to really

627
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,798
happen is that we're you know i think

628
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,000
that we've

629
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,798
we're almost kind of hitting

630
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,038
optimization

631
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,319
for those smokers plants like the plants

632
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,599
that the consumers want

633
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,759
but really what we need to do is make

634
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,719
those plants into more robust versions

635
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,798
of themselves the

636
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,960
the needs of the producers right like i

637
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,759
said again plant architecture

638
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,240
like you said michael their ability to

639
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,440
to

640
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,519
to stay rigid and tall and self-support

641
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,640
right anything that can save a producer

642
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,679
time and money labor cost you know the

643
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,000
amount of

644
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,600
leaf that you have to trim off a plant

645
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,798
you know all that kind of stuff

646
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,480
makes a huge impact and obviously when

647
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,158
we're talking about pests and pathogen

648
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,159
resistance as well

649
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,880
like those are all traits that benefit

650
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,799
the grower not necessarily the smoker

651
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,880
right and so i think one of the things

652
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,798
that we're definitely going to see is

653
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,440
those kinds of traits being developed

654
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,119
using like molecular techniques and qtls

655
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,558
and that kind of stuff

656
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,399
yeah no that makes that makes perfect

657
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:05,359
sense and it kind of ties really nice

658
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
into the next question

659
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,879
which is uh what are the modern ag tech

660
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
tools and innovations available to

661
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,720
cannabis plant breeders you know

662
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,159
oftentimes we think of tools as a

663
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,519
physical tangible thing

664
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,440
and and now we're starting to talk about

665
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,639
digital tools in in

666
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,240
sharing data um you know across across

667
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,759
borders and things like that where we

668
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,038
couldn't share certain

669
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,400
other elements before due to regulations

670
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,798
do you want to touch base a little bit

671
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,759
on some of the marker assisted breeding

672
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,400
and some of these tools that you were

673
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,400
just referencing

674
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,400
yes so genome sequencing and

675
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,798
biotechnology

676
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,320
really has really opened the whole book

677
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,720
up for

678
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,439
what we can do during love or you know

679
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,679
animal and

680
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,120
plant life but you know it's more

681
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,080
accepted in the context of plant life

682
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,319
making crosses

683
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,240
we're just mating plants together from

684
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,359
within the family

685
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,120
and ending up with what outcomes but

686
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,558
we can do all sorts of things to the

687
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,839
plants

688
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:06,558
to make that process much more efficient

689
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,158
in what we're doing

690
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,759
and now that we've sequenced the entire

691
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,400
cannabis genome

692
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,000
you know over the last 30 years people

693
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,919
have been working out what all these

694
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,558
different genes do

695
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,320
in arabidopsis and these model plants

696
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,079
and corn and barley and every other you

697
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,000
know major ag crop that we can think

698
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,599
of and we've begun to understand these

699
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,839
genes and just like in the animal

700
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,399
kingdom those genes are conserved or

701
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,519
shared across all different types of

702
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
plants so

703
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,200
you know like for example the genes

704
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,759
involved in harvesting sunlight

705
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,840
and and photosynthesis obviously like

706
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,960
those genes are conserved across all

707
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,798
plants

708
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,360
right and and um so as we've begun to

709
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,519
like

710
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,000
you know figure out this big hair ball

711
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,079
and and learn what these genes do across

712
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,720
all these different species now that

713
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,678
we've sequenced the cannabis genome

714
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,200
we're starting to get all of this uh

715
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,798
information and understanding about

716
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,319
what the genes in the canon you know

717
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,400
both the genes that are

718
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,759
unique to the cannabis plants and how we

719
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,080
can

720
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,480
um learn about and play with those genes

721
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,399
but also how we can take our knowledge

722
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,480
from other species about like for

723
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,120
example powdery mildew resistance or

724
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,038
resist resistance to botrytis right and

725
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,558
how we can actually

726
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,798
use the lessons that we've learned in

727
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,558
other plants to

728
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,759
make some better breeding choices in

729
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:30,399
cannabis as well right

730
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,440
right and that's kind of how you find if

731
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,960
you already found

732
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,880
pathogen resistant gene and hops or

733
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,840
another species you can see if that

734
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,760
happens to be conserved across

735
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,158
through the cannabis as well and you

736
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,038
know use the same sequence

737
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,919
and look for it i believe that didn't

738
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,319
someone do that

739
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,320
ryan

740
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,880
oh i'm not sure if they're with what the

741
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,000
work is correlated with the hops but

742
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,278
yeah a lot like i said a lot of these

743
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,798
pathways are

744
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,558
they're conserved all the way across so

745
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,798
for example there's something called

746
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,678
uh polyglacturones which is a gene

747
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:04,960
that's

748
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,840
involved in a whole bunch of different

749
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,960
things things but

750
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,480
you know it's something that can be

751
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,679
certain fungus is when they attack the

752
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
plant that can produce more this thing

753
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,440
essentially

754
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,799
helps break down the plant and so we can

755
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,960
certain plants have these

756
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:25,038
they're called pgips or black sorry

757
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,360
polyglycerones inhibitory proteins

758
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,480
and you know certain versions of these

759
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,199
genes or

760
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,400
certain plant lines have more copies of

761
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,440
these genes

762
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:40,480
more resistant to you know for example

763
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,480
you know botrytis scenario grain mold um

764
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,759
so anyway the point is is that yeah we

765
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,440
can

766
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,200
we can look for these sequences and

767
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,480
again like i was saying before

768
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,240
it's one of those kind of the special

769
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,079
things about cannabis you know a lot of

770
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,440
these selfing species like tomatoes they

771
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,558
don't have

772
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,558
they've gone through these genetic

773
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,079
bottlenecks that they made them

774
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,119
much more easy to breed within

775
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:03,678
themselves and remain true to type

776
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:07,038
but the way that cannabis breeds like

777
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,038
i've said before in the past i think

778
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,678
[Music]

779
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,000
it cannabis breeds more like humans and

780
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,840
so

781
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,839
if you look at humans for any given

782
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,158
trait eye color hair color

783
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,000
skin color height you know there's again

784
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,440
there's this vast continuum of

785
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,798
performance

786
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,440
um across any given trip and that that

787
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:27,839
that's happened because humans have

788
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,320
taken

789
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,038
have gone all over the world and you

790
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,439
know

791
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,480
mutations they they happen they just

792
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,000
happen within

793
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,200
any given genome right and that becomes

794
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,599
a marker for like

795
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,759
a a mutation event that happened in one

796
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,599
place at one specific time

797
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,278
and all pl and all plants are people

798
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,798
that descend from that mutation are

799
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,599
going to share that common trait

800
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,440
right and so over time like the branches

801
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,119
on our family tree

802
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,519
they change they have all these little

803
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:01,359
you know changes in variation

804
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:02,000
and um cannabis is full of these little

805
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,439
changes

806
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,038
all the way across the genome and

807
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,400
so you know i think in the context of

808
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,240
how we're

809
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,120
going to use this information to make

810
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,120
better plans in the future

811
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,639
it's all fine and dandy to have these

812
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:22,000
fancy tools but really

813
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,679
like i you know for example for the gdp

814
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,839
that's the the molecular screen that

815
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,000
you're saying the genome-wide

816
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:33,678
associations um

817
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,880
or or gbs genome uh or genotyping by

818
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,360
sequencing

819
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,399
we have a lot of discovery work to still

820
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,038
do

821
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,759
um to understand what these genetic

822
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,079
variation

823
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,359
variants mean you know we've all seen

824
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,359
with the covid thing again

825
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,959
i think it's it's kind of like a great

826
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,398
everybody's having this public lesson of

827
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,079
biotechnology but

828
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,599
you know everybody knows what a variant

829
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,879
is

830
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,879
now right and so

831
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,000
you can kind of think of the cannabis

832
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,839
genome is that every gene has a variant

833
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,519
and we need to understand what those

834
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,000
gene variants mean

835
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,359
in the context of the plant and then we

836
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,640
kind of need to catalog

837
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:14,398
all the different variants um and that

838
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,240
is and then figure out how we put them

839
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,879
back together in different ways

840
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,240
right to to yield genetic outcomes that

841
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,399
we want which is really what we were

842
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,480
doing with the chemical analysis

843
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,798
breeding program with mark and i don't

844
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,319
doing down in california right is we

845
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,720
were using

846
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,678
the lab to screen for these chemical

847
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,360
variants

848
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,798
and then selecting those plants and

849
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,319
using them for screening and creating

850
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,000
new families right and

851
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,599
combining them in different ways and

852
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,119
it's the combination of those different

853
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,519
sets of gene variants that leads you to

854
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,959
get

855
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,119
cbg or thcv right or

856
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,798
cbgbv is a good example because it's

857
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,439
those two previous ones

858
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:51,440
put together

859
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
so so beyond the fact that there's a ton

860
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:59,119
of discovery to do

861
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,880
as growers and breeders are

862
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,319
making you know new discoveries and

863
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,039
collecting more data

864
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,000
how do these tools help support um

865
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,200
things like ip

866
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,480
protection or do they help support

867
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,640
things like ip protection

868
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,599
yeah it's another way does someone else

869
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,720
want to take that one mark do you want

870
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,079
to take that one

871
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,960
sure you know a perfect way to create a

872
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,839
bulletproof

873
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,919
plant would be for example to really tap

874
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:30,959
cannabis's potential by

875
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,320
let's see cannabis has the olive tolic

876
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,880
acid pathway

877
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,798
so does something called streptomyces

878
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,600
you use streptomyces to

879
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:41,839
to essentially brew anti-cancer

880
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:45,038
chemotherapies like bleomyosin

881
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,720
if you could crispr in a nice gene

882
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,798
to follow that all the tolic acid

883
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,960
pathway have the

884
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,158
cannabis plant creating real

885
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,919
pharmaceutical

886
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,200
anti-cancer chemotherapies in the

887
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,880
trichome

888
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,240
that would be like a bulletproof plant

889
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,520
almost as similar as

890
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,399
how the roundup ready gene is uh

891
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,000
distributed across multiple plants

892
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,359
monsanto could certainly do that with

893
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,558
cannabis as well

894
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,398
i mean in theory

895
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,000
hey mark would you mind um maybe for

896
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:14,879
some of the newer listeners giving kind

897
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,919
of just like a

898
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,520
a kind of a gentle breakdown on um

899
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,640
marker assisted selection and kind of

900
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,839
snip clips and kind of how those

901
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,840
function and breeding

902
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,360
uh well i'm i'm definitely not the

903
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,399
smartest guy on this call to do that

904
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:35,439
it's definitely ryan um and

905
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,319
but eurofins and medicinal genomics

906
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,519
they recently uh launched a snip tip for

907
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,599
hemp

908
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:45,759
um and they'll provide uh you know the

909
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,278
snip suits i believe they provide the

910
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,480
snip sequences and

911
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:53,919
medicinal genomics does a nice work up

912
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,159
to help you correlate

913
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,960
a trait that you might observe in the

914
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,640
plant

915
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,079
and you could have a control plant and

916
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,159
you could snip chip

917
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,599
you know get the data for both of them

918
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,559
compare the data

919
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,359
and if you can find a pattern that

920
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,759
correlates

921
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:14,079
to your morphological or

922
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:15,038
chemotaxonomical data then you can use

923
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,278
that marker

924
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,960
to further your breeding program without

925
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,319
you know growing your plant all the way

926
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,240
out or whatever

927
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,480
i mean like i said ryan's probably way

928
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,200
better at breaking this down than i am

929
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,720
because

930
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,399
yeah ryan there's an interesting

931
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,159
question that came in and it's

932
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,319
when will genetic markers be for

933
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,559
intersex plants be available

934
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,960
and is this something that's possible

935
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,119
you can speak to that

936
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,319
but there's it's funny because we have

937
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,199
all these different claims from

938
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,319
companies

939
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,319
there's a canadian company that's

940
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,599
claiming they have a test for it but

941
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,278
you know they haven't hope they haven't

942
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,359
published on it and they haven't opened

943
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,159
it up to external validation so

944
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,398
it's kind of hard to to really say that

945
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,600
they do have the test or not right

946
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,918
um eventually

947
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,519
eventually we'll get there there was

948
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,278
recently a canadian group again i think

949
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,720
i mentioned on the last

950
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:10,159
call that there was a group or

951
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,600
our last uh you know little whatever

952
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,278
zoom panel um there's a group in canada

953
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,480
i think from ubc and they just did a set

954
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,880
of studies where they were looking at

955
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,240
the genes that were turned on and off

956
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,480
by spraying sts on the plants or yeah

957
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,159
sts on the planet sts for those that

958
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,278
don't know is a chemical called silver

959
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,278
thiosulfate

960
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,278
and it interferes with ethylene

961
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,119
production in all plants

962
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,960
but in cannabis that leads to the

963
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,918
induction of male flowers on female

964
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,679
plants

965
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,200
um so essentially they sprayed sts look

966
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,960
on the plants and then looked at which

967
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,120
genes changed their levels of

968
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,038
transcription

969
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,199
and so there's probably a good candidate

970
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,000
set of genes in there

971
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,159
um related to obviously the differences

972
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,480
between male and female male flowers

973
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,679
right and so we're gonna get some cues

974
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,759
um

975
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,759
as the next few serious experiments come

976
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,798
out of that line of work

977
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,000
um i i mean i can't really it could be

978
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,839
to

979
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,599
tomorrow it could be you know five years

980
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,319
from now okay

981
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,678
um i don't know of intersex is probably

982
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,278
i don't think that's the most important

983
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,960
trait that people are looking at

984
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,038
it would be really nice to understand

985
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,038
the entire sex story in cannabis

986
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,720
but i i think that there's other traits

987
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,919
that people are chasing

988
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,600
um more importantly you know and

989
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,720
and that that's something we'll learn

990
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:33,119
kind of as we go along

991
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,038
sorry if that was a rambling answer no

992
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,278
no it's great it's an honest answer

993
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,798
um you know and we've had some

994
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:39,359
innovations come out of some of these

995
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:40,720
tools that

996
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,398
have helped us kind of get to some of

997
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,000
these goals a little bit faster

998
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,239
um one of them being autoflower

999
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,599
varieties um and another being

1000
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,880
um uh triploids um

1001
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,319
so i wasn't sure um who'd be the best

1002
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,440
one to kind of start on autoflowers i

1003
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,960
don't know mojave

1004
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,880
is that something you want you want to

1005
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,840
take

1006
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,120
um yeah sure well as we mentioned

1007
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,079
earlier you know otter flowers are a

1008
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,078
perfect example

1009
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:10,799
of a farmer innovation that you know

1010
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,879
people don't generally seek autoflowers

1011
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,720
for smoking it hasn't been like

1012
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,960
the market hasn't been pushing towards

1013
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,559
autoflowers but they open up a lot of

1014
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,480
opportunity for farmers so um

1015
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,320
you know there's been over the past few

1016
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,159
years but a lot of improvement in the

1017
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,240
autoflower market we're seeing

1018
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,679
plants that are getting close to what a

1019
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,239
consumer would consider

1020
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,440
desirable um obviously there are a lot

1021
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,519
of amazing out of flowers but they're

1022
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,039
not quite at what a traditional

1023
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,719
photoperiod plant does but we're getting

1024
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,679
there so that's an innovation that

1025
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,559
really

1026
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,679
really you know was was driven by a

1027
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,159
farmer's need to

1028
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,800
you know utilize different different

1029
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,398
regions

1030
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,039
different times of the year for

1031
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,319
production and one great tool that segre

1032
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,599
has developed is they have a

1033
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,000
patent-pending um

1034
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,320
technology for actually um

1035
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,239
micropropagation of autoflower which is

1036
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,440
really going to have a lot of impact

1037
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,078
because as everyone knows with

1038
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,760
autoflower

1039
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,119
you can't hold the plant in vegetative

1040
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,640
state so

1041
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,480
that's going to be an important yeah

1042
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,400
it's really interesting yeah

1043
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,240
absolutely um yeah we've seen a bunch of

1044
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,320
especially in california a

1045
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,159
major increase in people seeking

1046
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,280
autoflower seed

1047
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,078
maybe they have don't quite have the

1048
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,599
infrastructure

1049
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,200
tools in place in their greenhouse and

1050
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,640
so it's kind of an alternative for them

1051
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,039
it's also a clean start in a lot of

1052
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,799
cases for them as well

1053
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,639
rob can you speak a little bit of when

1054
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,160
we kind of saw autoflowers kind of

1055
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:36,400
come around and kind of what what caused

1056
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:39,598
uh the the peak interest in the early

1057
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,599
days with autoflowers

1058
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:47,200
you're basically uh

1059
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,200
autoflower is

1060
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,599
in its correct definition is

1061
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:58,559
a plant that's photoperiod neutral

1062
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:02,079
that means that it flowers based on time

1063
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,078
how old the plant is how

1064
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,159
developed it is rather than when the

1065
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,639
lights

1066
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,799
go on and off so they don't flower

1067
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,358
because of long day lengths or flower

1068
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,359
because of short day lengths

1069
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,799
long night lengths is more an accurate

1070
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,319
way to look at it

1071
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,599
as cannabis but flower whenever they

1072
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,960
reach a certain developmental age

1073
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,640
and that means essentially that you put

1074
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
it in the ground and it flowers a

1075
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,159
certain number of weeks later no matter

1076
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,279
what time of the year it is

1077
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,039
um this has been

1078
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,760
sort of the holy grail for readers for a

1079
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,039
long time the first person to really

1080
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,839
jump into this was

1081
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,279
neville schumacher god rest his soul but

1082
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:48,880
uh

1083
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:54,240
he he tried this experiment

1084
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,400
with feral hungarian varieties

1085
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,239
which are very weedy and like wild

1086
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,079
plants that there are escapes from

1087
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,879
cultivation they're not really wild

1088
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,400
plants but

1089
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,119
they've gone back to many of the wild

1090
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,800
traits and that includes

1091
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,838
maturing seeds relatively early

1092
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,440
but wild plants have a shotgun approach

1093
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,119
to survival

1094
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,159
and that also means that those same

1095
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,800
plants produce seeds very late

1096
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,358
if the season was abnormally long that

1097
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,359
year

1098
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:24,400
they produced seeds that also matured

1099
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,039
quite late

1100
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,039
so they had seeds falling off those

1101
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,159
plants

1102
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:35,519
to find themselves in a situation where

1103
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:38,000
they would grow the next spring

1104
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,440
when those plants were crossed in with

1105
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
with modern uh

1106
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,440
dope varieties what you ended up with

1107
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,838
was

1108
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,039
varieties that never really matured and

1109
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:48,719
with cannabis

1110
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,159
drug cannabis fries any cannabis

1111
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,358
varieties whether you're after

1112
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,279
seed or or the drug portion you need

1113
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:58,639
female flowers that mature

1114
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,560
and finish they don't just continue

1115
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:03,679
making seeds or

1116
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,960
or trichomes and and go on and on until

1117
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,719
they freeze to death

1118
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,960
so that was the problem with the first

1119
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,959
ones

1120
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,480
maybe they were not truly auto flowers

1121
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,358
maybe they just had a different sort of

1122
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,880
trait that uh

1123
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:21,679
breeders in those days hoped for

1124
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,599
autoflowers they met with no success

1125
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,919
they dropped out of the picture

1126
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:29,119
completely for at least a decade

1127
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,680
and then the new autoflowers came along

1128
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,880
and what what year was this for

1129
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,358
reference sake

1130
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,960
oh bad with my years but i would say

1131
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:40,799
well neville started his

1132
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:44,320
projects in the early 80s

1133
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,640
mid 80s um we didn't hear about

1134
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,119
uh they were called autoflowers they

1135
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,358
were early maturing varieties

1136
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,559
yes they were early to flower but they

1137
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,719
wouldn't really mature

1138
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,239
what do you what do you say he called

1139
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,719
them reuter alice hybrid

1140
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,078
alice's what he said was yes his german

1141
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,639
they weren't really rude or alice

1142
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,119
but you know he even even rude or alice

1143
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:07,759
i mean

1144
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,960
rude or alice wasn't born you know

1145
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,280
what's it what's it called like the

1146
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,039
jesus birth he was like divine birth it

1147
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,040
wasn't a divine birth

1148
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,960
russia because somebody brought hemp

1149
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:24,960
seeds

1150
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,880
cannabis seeds to russia at some point

1151
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,559
in time into these northern climes

1152
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,000
and planted them and the only plants

1153
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,480
that survived

1154
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,519
were the ones that had that phenotype

1155
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,838
that would

1156
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,440
start setting flowers from seed right or

1157
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,239
whatever 50 days from

1158
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,119
from germination right and so when the

1159
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,479
early frost came only the plants that

1160
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,400
would have had matured seed would have

1161
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,559
been genetic contributors to the next

1162
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,160
generation anything with a longer

1163
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,000
flowering period would have would have

1164
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,759
gotten wiped out right

1165
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,239
and so it was really a big bottlenecking

1166
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,079
that brought that um autoflowering is

1167
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,679
actually the one thing that makes it an

1168
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,960
interesting trade in the context of the

1169
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,480
discussion i think

1170
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,440
is that it's what's called a single

1171
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,760
nuclear recessive

1172
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,039
gene and that just means it's one

1173
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,319
genetic mutation

1174
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:16,239
at a place on one chromosome um and if

1175
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,559
you have two copies of that gene you end

1176
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:22,879
up with the autoflowering trait

1177
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:25,679
um if you get only get one copy of that

1178
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,480
trait you end up with plants that flower

1179
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:30,879
moderately quickly

1180
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,000
um and if you have no copies then it's

1181
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,480
just a

1182
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,760
a standard you know photoperiod plant or

1183
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,280
photoperiod determinant plant

1184
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,560
which is really different from a lot of

1185
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,240
these other traits when we're talking

1186
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,599
about like yield you know or even

1187
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,118
pathogen resistance

1188
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,280
those traits are a response that they're

1189
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,358
called like polygenic traits

1190
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,720
so it's really like the additive effect

1191
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,880
of

1192
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,598
up to like you know 100 genes for

1193
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,680
example that all contribute together

1194
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,318
and add up little bits at a time to

1195
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:02,078
create what we consider

1196
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:04,079
you know a plant that's bulletproof in

1197
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,200
terms of um

1198
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,800
pathogen resistance

1199
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:13,118
or yield right it's up you actually

1200
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,880
optimize yield to its highest point

1201
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,640
and breeding for those kinds of traits

1202
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,358
is much different than autoflowering

1203
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,879
trades

1204
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,400
and autoflowering traits are easy to

1205
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,720
track

1206
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,838
even just as a visual phenotypic marker

1207
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:25,199
obviously because it's different

1208
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,199
flowering rest of the plants but you can

1209
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,879
also track it with

1210
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,559
molecular genetics whereas if you're

1211
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,680
trying to do that molecular genetics

1212
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,119
approach

1213
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:38,960
to a polygenic trait um

1214
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,880
it's much more complex right

1215
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,960
can we have a discussion around kind of

1216
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,000
like i guess like employee

1217
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,639
conversation um so

1218
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,159
for everyone who may be not up to speed

1219
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,719
on stuff can you kind of maybe

1220
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,598
give us a breakdown of a polyploid um

1221
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,279
versus a

1222
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,680
tricloid and kind of i know there's been

1223
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,480
a lot of noise in the news from the

1224
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,598
crawford brothers um over at oregon cbd

1225
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,719
they've got some

1226
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,599
things that they're releasing this year

1227
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:08,799
they seem to be pretty excited about

1228
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,000
it i mean the best example

1229
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,839
in my opinion for teaching about

1230
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,920
polyploids is looking at bananas

1231
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,519
right so bananas the ones that we see

1232
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,358
commercially in the superstore

1233
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:18,960
or in the in the grocery store

1234
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,279
everywhere in the world

1235
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,760
those those bananas have three sets of

1236
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,960
chromosomes rather than two

1237
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,359
and so a you know the standard condition

1238
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,000
for for most plants in most of their

1239
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:32,480
stages of

1240
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,039
life is to have two sets of chromosomes

1241
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,119
like we as

1242
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,639
humans do we have one full set of our

1243
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,000
chromosomes from our mom and one from

1244
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,400
her dad

1245
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,760
um there's a little breeding trick that

1246
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,079
you can do

1247
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,040
to end up with plants that have three

1248
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,000
copies and it

1249
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,679
involves using a chemical branch or a

1250
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,318
chemical dunk essentially you know

1251
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,719
exposing a plant to a chemical that

1252
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:54,960
force

1253
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,199
that in it inhibits the cells when

1254
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,599
they're dividing in a specific way

1255
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,519
it blocks the formation of spindle

1256
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,800
fibers during meiosis

1257
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,280
and the the net result is that when you

1258
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,000
cross

1259
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,280
you you can create has four copies of of

1260
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,440
a chromosome

1261
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,920
of sorry four copies of chromosomes and

1262
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,920
then when you breed that plant

1263
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,599
to a pla a normal plant that has two

1264
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,280
copies of chromosomes

1265
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,200
you end up with plants that have three

1266
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,960
copies of chromosomes

1267
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,960
and there's a whole bunch of different

1268
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,318
things that can happen in the plant

1269
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,960
depending on the species in bananas

1270
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,079
the the most important agronomic trait

1271
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,400
was that

1272
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,000
the seeds in the banana became like

1273
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,920
infinitesimally small so

1274
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,199
when you break a banana open and you you

1275
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,039
look at it in a cross section there's

1276
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,639
those tiny little black dots

1277
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,480
you know in a wild banana they're not

1278
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:45,519
tiny little dots they're seeds that

1279
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,119
would like

1280
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,639
really bother your teeth if you're

1281
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,280
trying to eat a banana

1282
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,118
so through making polyploid sorry

1283
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,760
triploid plants

1284
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,280
we were able to you know destroy the

1285
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,240
ability for these plants to make seeds

1286
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,920
and

1287
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,358
in fact it's something that the crawford

1288
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,639
brothers are saying has happened also

1289
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:03,519
with the cannabis plants which is to be

1290
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,199
expected

1291
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:09,039
that they became almost sterile

1292
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,239
right so these particular triploid

1293
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,000
plants because of

1294
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,159
you know because they have three sets of

1295
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,639
genetic chromosomes

1296
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:19,039
in the in the meiosis process or the

1297
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:21,838
formation of a

1298
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,880
of a gamete with a pollen and ovary you

1299
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:24,880
know

1300
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,160
it doesn't work properly because there's

1301
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,358
an imbalance in the number of

1302
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,838
chromosomes

1303
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:32,719
and that leads to the seed dying right

1304
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,960
or never forming

1305
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,000
but interestingly you know it also does

1306
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,159
other things because it gives

1307
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,079
you rather than having two sets of genes

1308
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,920
you can now have three genes so

1309
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,359
it allows you to stack genes in a

1310
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,838
different way within a different

1311
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:46,799
within a given plant and they're saying

1312
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,440
that they're having

1313
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,800
you know success and increased terpene

1314
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,559
and cannabinoid content

1315
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,920
and perhaps interesting new profiles

1316
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,559
because you can have you know rather

1317
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,480
than having an interaction of two copies

1318
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,480
of the terpene synthases now you might

1319
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,920
have three copies of the terpene

1320
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,639
synthases that are all different and

1321
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,760
that

1322
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,440
you know theoretically could lead

1323
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,800
to some new phenotype that we haven't

1324
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,920
seen yet yeah

1325
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,119
that's fascinating um well and also dr

1326
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,200
richardson did

1327
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,559
this work with the watermelon as you all

1328
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,078
know the seedless water that's the

1329
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:23,199
seedless watermelon right

1330
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,680
triploid watermelon and more recently

1331
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,879
they use these techniques with maize to

1332
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,719
essentially skip

1333
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,440
10 years of conventional breeding to get

1334
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:34,639
100 homozygous plants to breed

1335
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,800
new hybrids it's all the really

1336
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:43,039
non-gmo corn can do to stay competitive

1337
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,160
it's really interesting and it's kind of

1338
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,559
a good technique because you get the

1339
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:50,239
double haploid pretty weak

1340
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:52,480
but you know that f1 is 100

1341
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,439
homozygous and if you get a fit

1342
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,960
population it works really well

1343
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,639
the growers out there too sometimes

1344
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,159
there's confusion between like

1345
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:04,400
mutation or fasciation and like ploidy

1346
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,598
um can you guys talk to some of the

1347
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,599
differences there that you see

1348
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,800
yeah that was i don't know how those two

1349
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,559
got confused over

1350
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,280
world phylotaxi which is the number of

1351
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,799
branches on a plant somehow got confused

1352
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,000
with the number of chromosomes in a

1353
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,000
plant and

1354
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,599
they're totally different things like

1355
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,519
one you can see within your eyes

1356
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,000
the other one you can't right but

1357
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:34,239
somehow in the stoner lore they ended up

1358
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,838
as the same thing paul polyploids

1359
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:42,479
or or better yet aneuploids

1360
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,838
are essentially variations that we can

1361
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,838
do

1362
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,519
we can induce implants on the number of

1363
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:48,000
chromosomes they have so for there's

1364
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:49,519
like

1365
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,440
for example there's wheat varieties that

1366
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:53,920
i believe are hexaploid they have

1367
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,639
six sets of chromosomes so you know if

1368
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,440
cannabis

1369
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,559
typically has 10 cents of chromosomes in

1370
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,480
one

1371
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,078
you know single genome inherited from

1372
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,760
the mother like i'm talking about a

1373
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,119
genome in a pollen grain

1374
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,680
technically when a pollen

1375
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,880
brain and an ovary you know they fuse

1376
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:12,879
and you have

1377
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,280
yeah fertilization from that point on

1378
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,039
the plant we refer to it as its genome

1379
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,760
but really it's two singular

1380
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,039
genomes one inherited from mom and one

1381
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,400
from dad

1382
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:28,000
right and so you can create plants with

1383
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,000
two four six or eight copies of those

1384
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,760
genes and those are what we refer to as

1385
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,239
polyploids

1386
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,359
um and then you get into aneuploids

1387
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,439
which are like

1388
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,279
you know you have eight copies of one

1389
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,480
chromosome but only seven copies of

1390
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,640
another for example

1391
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,519
or three copies of you know three copies

1392
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:45,598
of

1393
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:47,440
five chromosomes and a few less of other

1394
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,200
chromosomes you're essentially adding or

1395
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,318
deleting extra

1396
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,838
chromosomes um

1397
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:55,440
i know there was some excitement too

1398
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:56,239
with you know obviously we all know that

1399
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,599
there's

1400
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:01,279
feral hemp growing everywhere um there's

1401
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,960
people trying to grow hemp and there's a

1402
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,240
ton of cross-pollination happening and

1403
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,358
it seemed like a lot of the excitement

1404
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,159
was around

1405
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:09,358
um the the potential for cannabis flower

1406
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,399
to kind of exist

1407
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:15,598
or coexist without being seeded

1408
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,240
by some of these new varieties well like

1409
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,039
ryan

1410
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:20,000
said the seeds didn't go away completely

1411
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,719
in the banana

1412
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,039
and i'm sure you've seen a a white

1413
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,439
immature seed in a watermelon

1414
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,119
i would have to say it's probably very

1415
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,440
similar

1416
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,280
yeah but we'll get it down significantly

1417
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,519
but you know seeds will exist or

1418
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,400
mutation will exist that's exactly the

1419
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:38,400
results we

1420
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,318
realized quite a while ago in hungary

1421
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:47,358
back in the day taking

1422
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:49,838
finding true tetraploids

1423
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,279
not aneuploids that had one extra of one

1424
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,159
chromosome

1425
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,559
one less of another but ones that were

1426
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,279
pure

1427
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,160
tetraploids with four sets of

1428
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,200
chromosomes

1429
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,118
twice as many as a normal plant

1430
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,558
and crossing those with diploids to make

1431
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,039
triploids which is the

1432
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,559
watermelon strategy i might point out

1433
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,279
for a minute the bananas were a

1434
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:14,400
naturally occurring

1435
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,400
triploid it wasn't a product of breeding

1436
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,760
this is a product of selection

1437
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,720
and cloning watermelons are a product of

1438
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,200
breeding

1439
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,879
and we tried the same thing and we got

1440
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,358
exactly what mark's talking about you've

1441
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,358
got those nasty little nubs

1442
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,920
that are actually just as unpleasant as

1443
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:34,480
the seed and you couldn't roll them out

1444
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,318
in a shoebox lid they're just in there

1445
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,318
and they still taste nasty and it's not

1446
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:41,279
what people want in their

1447
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:43,599
cannabis which is why groups haven't

1448
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,680
really moved forward to the triploids

1449
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,200
yes they won't make a full-on seed but

1450
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:51,279
they still have a little shriveled

1451
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:54,318
ovule in there that is a seed precursor

1452
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,160
let's say they're not pleasant was that

1453
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:59,358
work done with both that

1454
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:02,480
over 100 work was done with dr yvonne

1455
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:04,639
baucher in hungary yes

1456
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,760
yep cool and you know but but for the

1457
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,879
hemp game it's

1458
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:12,319
it's genius right because what happened

1459
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,119
previously where the cbg was released

1460
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,759
then the next year everybody had this

1461
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:19,119
heterozygous

1462
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,640
auto cbg seed that they were um

1463
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:25,680
selling but now you can't

1464
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:28,078
if it doesn't if it doesn't complete a

1465
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,919
a seed well you have to buy the seed

1466
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,160
again next year

1467
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,280
so it's good for business and if you're

1468
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:36,318
extracting

1469
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:39,440
and the seed doesn't form fully

1470
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,440
and get oils built up in them

1471
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,639
then for extraction you probably have

1472
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,960
less uh

1473
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:47,598
you know byproduct from the the hemp

1474
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,599
seed oil

1475
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:52,879
i know a lot of people want to jump to q

1476
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,800
and a so i'm going to kind of jump into

1477
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,800
this next question and we can keep it

1478
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,559
somewhat brief but

1479
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,240
how will the cannabis breeding

1480
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,340
competitive landscape evolve in the

1481
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:03,199
coming years

1482
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:07,039
[Music]

1483
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:10,480
mohave you want to take a stab that one

1484
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:13,838
uh yeah well uh hopefully it'll kind of

1485
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,559
move out from this uh

1486
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:17,838
fascination with phenohunting through

1487
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,319
all these polyhybrids

1488
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,358
and move towards kind of a more um

1489
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:24,558
focused

1490
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:27,838
attempt to isolate specific lines

1491
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:29,280
and see what that um can bring because

1492
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:31,279
we you know we

1493
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,640
we know that there's there's so much

1494
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,319
that cannabis can

1495
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:39,598
can offer in terms of its compounds and

1496
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:41,519
um and industrial applications but

1497
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,880
i really feel strongly that we have to

1498
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,000
kind of isolate

1499
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,960
and start working on specific traits

1500
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,480
um so that we can in the future make the

1501
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,159
hybrids that really

1502
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,119
you know work for specific applications

1503
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,598
i mean look at that

1504
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,358
we're talking about triploids um you

1505
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,400
know they had to develop

1506
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:03,759
the the diploid versions of the these

1507
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,200
f1s that they're releasing

1508
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,400
you know so that was a considerable

1509
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:11,598
amount of breeding and then they had to

1510
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,200
you know um had to find the

1511
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,640
tetraploid versions that didn't have a

1512
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,358
bunch of deleterious

1513
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,879
um chromosomes that you know i guess it

1514
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:20,880
goes both ways you know everyone kind of

1515
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,640
thinks of triploids as being

1516
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,160
this amazing super plant but it could

1517
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,279
also bring a lot of

1518
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,159
negative attributes as well so it's kind

1519
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,519
of a matter of

1520
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,960
isolating and working at you know having

1521
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:36,559
having a variety that

1522
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,358
is just high in a particular um

1523
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,640
chemical profile and also has an

1524
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,159
advantageous trait

1525
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:47,118
such as structure and working on that

1526
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,318
specifically so that you can create a

1527
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,519
short

1528
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:54,159
plant high in limonene and a

1529
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,639
long lanky plant high in terpenoline or

1530
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:56,159
whatever

1531
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:57,838
and just have the ability to make a

1532
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:59,199
bunch of f1s

1533
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:01,199
from those is you know kind of like

1534
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:04,239
weeding out the polyhybrids

1535
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:06,078
um i see that as being an important um

1536
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:08,159
breeding strategy as opposed to trying

1537
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,559
to get as much into

1538
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,759
each individual plant as right now we're

1539
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,160
kind of obsessed with bringing

1540
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,400
everything in and throwing it all into

1541
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,480
this one individual cultivar but you

1542
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,400
know i think yeah

1543
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,920
cannabis i don't think cannabis is ready

1544
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,559
for exploiting

1545
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,200
triploids and you know that kind of

1546
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,280
stuff yet

1547
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,199
it's just there's a lot of work that

1548
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,599
needs to be done still

1549
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:34,318
making plants uniform stabilizing genes

1550
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:37,359
like even basic genes for color flavor

1551
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:38,400
or cannabinoid content you know every

1552
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:42,318
time you add another

1553
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,119
trait into the mix things get much more

1554
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:44,960
complex

1555
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,280
right it's like you're juggling more

1556
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,039
balls but it's exponential

1557
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,400
right every literally every time you add

1558
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:52,800
another trait that you're trying to

1559
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,760
maintain in a population

1560
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,039
you have to grow more plants to find the

1561
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,800
ones that have

1562
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,159
you know the combination of all the

1563
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
things that you're looking for the

1564
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:02,480
balance

1565
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,079
yeah it seems like you know with the

1566
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,000
triploids they're saying oh

1567
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,000
well you know we're seeing increased

1568
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,440
yields um

1569
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,760
but they're also seeing increased

1570
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,920
botrytis in molds of mildews you know

1571
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,480
because the bud structure's so

1572
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,680
dense like it might not even be the

1573
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,559
blood blood structure it's like that's

1574
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:20,000
kind of one of the things i'm

1575
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,280
talking about like you know look

1576
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,318
everybody's growing these fishes the

1577
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,240
kushas are

1578
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:25,838
extremely susceptible to powdery mildew

1579
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,279
right it's because they have a set of

1580
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:29,519
genes in them

1581
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,440
they're again they're not optimized for

1582
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,920
resistance to powdery mildew

1583
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,480
so when you take those plants and now

1584
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,200
you've got

1585
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,480
three copies of them right you've got

1586
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:39,439
three doses it's like it's one of the

1587
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,280
things about triple

1588
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,798
is like you're saying it's like you get

1589
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,079
some good things that mojave was saying

1590
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:45,199
you get good things that come along but

1591
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,240
you also

1592
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:50,558
any any traits or any copies of genes

1593
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:54,078
that you have that are

1594
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,240
below par right below 50

1595
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,920
you're actually making the plant worse

1596
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:00,159
right and and now you've got three

1597
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:03,039
copies of them in a plant not two

1598
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:05,679
so it's it's one one it's a lot harder

1599
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:05,679
to breed with

1600
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,240
but yeah it's like it's like i kind of

1601
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,079
just feel like there's some more

1602
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,798
stabilization we kind of need to do in

1603
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,240
some of these

1604
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:15,519
basic like house cheese house keeping

1605
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,959
genes i mean

1606
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:21,920
it's like building a really complex

1607
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,960
big house on a tiny little foundation

1608
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,318
you know it's like

1609
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,159
at a certain point in time the whole

1610
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:27,759
thing is going to collapse and

1611
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:29,519
just because of the way that cannabis

1612
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,839
has been left out of

1613
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:33,679
the agricultural improvement breeding

1614
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:36,318
scene for the last

1615
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,440
75 years which is when all crops have

1616
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:39,199
really made

1617
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,960
the leaps and bounds in terms of

1618
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:42,879
technology and improvements

1619
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,559
you know cannabis was kind of left to

1620
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,079
people breeding

1621
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,680
plants in closets or you know

1622
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,760
at least it wasn't being done on a

1623
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,318
scientific principle so

1624
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,880
cannabis did get left behind and there's

1625
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:58,880
certain consequences involved in that

1626
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,519
and i i feel like now we're trying to

1627
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,318
build this really complex structure

1628
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:07,199
you know multi-billion dollar industry

1629
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:10,719
on a pretty shaky foundation

1630
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:11,199
um and we just need to do we need to

1631
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:12,639
sharpen

1632
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,639
the foundation you know we got to do

1633
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:17,838
some of these basic improvements

1634
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:20,960
still and and build upon that

1635
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:22,000
so i agree um this is a question that

1636
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,679
kind of comes in

1637
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,440
and it's for all of you guys um so

1638
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:28,719
you know 10 years ago it was people like

1639
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,720
yourselves and people on this panel that

1640
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,919
are actually talking about terpenes

1641
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,598
and now it seems like everyone's been

1642
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,280
talking about terps in the last you know

1643
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,200
couple years here

1644
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,960
from an individual perspective can you

1645
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,358
can each panels please compare

1646
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,519
where we are today on the terpene front

1647
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:46,078
with where we were 10 years ago

1648
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,079
and can each of you also please attempt

1649
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,280
to project in your crystal ball

1650
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,519
where we're going to be 10 years from

1651
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,519
today

1652
00:56:52,639 --> 00:57:02,480
i can start with that um

1653
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:05,920
where we were um decades ago

1654
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:09,838
is where we are now as far

1655
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:13,119
as the genetic capability to produce

1656
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:16,558
different terpenes what we've

1657
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:20,160
seen is this hybridization of multiple

1658
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:22,798
land raised groups that brought together

1659
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:23,679
favored terpene suites from each land

1660
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:27,358
race

1661
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:29,440
and and maybe the the more technical

1662
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:31,920
breeders on this panel can answer this

1663
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,079
but it seems to me to be a cumulative

1664
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:38,318
inheritance

1665
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,720
the the more terpene um

1666
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,558
biosynthetic possibilities the more gene

1667
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:43,039
combinations let's say you throw in

1668
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,000
there

1669
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,480
the more you see expressed it's not

1670
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,358
really

1671
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,280
one overriding the other so much now i

1672
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,519
think ryan and

1673
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,079
mark can address this more specifically

1674
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:59,199
but what we've come up with is a real

1675
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:02,160
tutti frutti blend of dessert

1676
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:05,039
cultivars and i don't see terpenes

1677
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:07,759
particularly

1678
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,639
lacking i see varieties where terpenes

1679
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,040
are more

1680
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,480
predominant than one than the other high

1681
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,279
terpenoline variety

1682
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,480
high caryophyllene variety something

1683
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,480
like this but

1684
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,240
all the other terpenes are still in

1685
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,240
there

1686
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:27,279
so what we've

1687
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:27,279
where's it gonna go

1688
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,960
i'm not sure i'm i'm not even sure the

1689
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:33,519
terpenes are

1690
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,519
exactly falling in with the with the

1691
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:37,920
same uh

1692
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:39,759
inheritance traits that we find

1693
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,880
inheritance characteristics we find with

1694
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,640
other traits

1695
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,000
it'd be interesting to see what other

1696
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:47,598
people want to say about that

1697
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,719
but yeah i'll add to

1698
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,119
you know we we don't even know how much

1699
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:53,679
is

1700
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,119
attributed to terpenes you know there's

1701
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:57,598
other aromatics

1702
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,960
um involved that we're just starting to

1703
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,680
understand more about

1704
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,960
um i'd like you know there's this study

1705
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,679
just released

1706
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,400
just last week i believe proving the

1707
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,838
efficacy

1708
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,960
of terpenes in the entourage effect

1709
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,798
and i think that was really you know

1710
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,000
groundbreaking to really be able to

1711
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:19,119
point towards

1712
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,599
certain terpenes having um

1713
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,160
contributing to this psychoactive effect

1714
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,079
and

1715
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:26,318
once we can kind of isolate and

1716
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:29,440
understand more about which terpenes

1717
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:31,039
modulate and and interact with the

1718
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,559
endocannabinoid system

1719
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:34,318
then we could start breeding towards

1720
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,640
those goals so we could have these

1721
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:39,838
foundational blocks that actually

1722
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:42,879
target specific um conditions or

1723
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:45,119
specific you know um traits that people

1724
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,000
find desirable in terms of effect

1725
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,400
because you know we

1726
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,358
right now we know lots of terpenes in a

1727
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,358
cannabis plant

1728
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:55,199
are dynamic and have a lot of aroma and

1729
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:57,519
flavor and people seem attracted to that

1730
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,679
just the same way we're attracted to

1731
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:01,199
other things that smell lovely but if

1732
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:04,480
some of those terpenes

1733
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:06,879
are um possibly getting in the way of

1734
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,798
the others you know kind of a in a you

1735
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,680
know an antagonistic way

1736
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:13,039
um getting a better understanding of

1737
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:15,279
what actually needs to be

1738
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:16,880
in this plant for it to have this

1739
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,880
particular effect

1740
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,200
and then focusing the breeding towards

1741
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,760
that particular

1742
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:25,679
chemical profile and then we can kind of

1743
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,119
then we can start to look at the variety

1744
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:30,239
improvement based off of you know

1745
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,160
we now know that this has these these um

1746
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:34,239
therapeutic properties that are very

1747
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,318
specific to this terpene cannabinoid

1748
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:39,519
ratio or these other aromatic

1749
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:42,719
um you know files or you know who knows

1750
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:44,400
what else is contributing to the effect

1751
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:45,838
then we can kind of start selecting and

1752
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,880
breeding to combine

1753
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:52,239
effects to make these hybrids these

1754
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:54,079
polyhybrids that actually do what we as

1755
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:56,399
breeders or as consumers

1756
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,519
or as farmers really want them to do as

1757
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,880
opposed to just kind of throwing

1758
01:00:57,519 --> 01:00:59,440
everything against the wall and saying

1759
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,559
these are

1760
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:04,639
really loud terpene profiles

1761
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,079
interesting yeah that paper that you

1762
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,558
just referenced mojave

1763
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:14,559
i believe i read and they used

1764
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:17,440
four different models and two suggested

1765
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,319
the synergy and two were inconclusive

1766
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,440
and they were both

1767
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:24,838
non is that right ryan did you read it

1768
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,599
yeah i read it they injected

1769
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:29,838
ridiculously huge equivalent doses of

1770
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:32,079
terpenes into mice

1771
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:34,318
and it's it's really quite questionable

1772
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:37,119
about whether you can even

1773
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:38,318
say like they definitely got receptor

1774
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,640
activation

1775
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:41,358
from some of those chirps but i mean

1776
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:44,639
there is

1777
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:46,960
zero zero zero chance of you ever

1778
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:50,239
achieving those levels of terpenes

1779
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:54,000
physiologically i mean you'd have to

1780
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:56,399
extract like i don't know 10 pounds and

1781
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,239
and do it in one dab you know i don't

1782
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:02,160
even even have anywhere close

1783
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:06,558
of of the amount of terps right um

1784
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:09,598
if you remember an icrs was a 2017

1785
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:12,400
dr bureau and i presented some

1786
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,798
cellular models for influen inflammation

1787
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,358
that showed that

1788
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:18,639
beta-carotene and cbd had a synergistic

1789
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,558
effect to increa

1790
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,639
decrease the inflammation in certain

1791
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:25,039
cell lines

1792
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:26,879
so we know that that's possible and the

1793
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,280
and the dosage in that experiment was

1794
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,400
more realistic and true to type and was

1795
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,599
based on the

1796
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:36,639
guava jam and garlic jam whole plant

1797
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,200
extracts actually and that that puts you

1798
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:39,519
know

1799
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,038
a good time stamp on that scenario but

1800
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:43,199
the original question was where were we

1801
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,880
10 years ago where were we today

1802
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,838
10 years ago you smelled your weed to

1803
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,119
buy it you didn't need to look at a lab

1804
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:50,480
report today everybody wants to buy the

1805
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,039
thc number

1806
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,519
it's like with the fido fax rollout in

1807
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:57,200
california and sc labs we're creating an

1808
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,759
industry standard

1809
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:02,000
packaging is now switching to have you

1810
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,000
know the top three color-coded terpenes

1811
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,920
based on the phytofacts the consumer's

1812
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,400
getting more educated

1813
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,559
ryan and i both know from our experience

1814
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,599
that different terpene profiles with

1815
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:16,559
identical cannabinoid profiles yield

1816
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,880
different experiences so much so as i

1817
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,039
can

1818
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:23,200
fool many thc users with certain

1819
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:25,280
hemp cultivars that we have in this

1820
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:28,000
table

1821
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:29,200
more importantly once the consumer or

1822
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,559
once the genetic

1823
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:34,480
library is comprehensive enough

1824
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,798
you know and people can try all these

1825
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,639
things that you know ryan and

1826
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:40,159
others have tried it's like when you go

1827
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,159
to a store and you say hey i want the

1828
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:43,598
highest thc concentration and then all

1829
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:46,480
of a sudden

1830
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,119
thanks to biotech and other breeders

1831
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,000
they say

1832
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:52,480
well we had there's six of them that's

1833
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,318
30 percent thc there's a myrsine

1834
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,400
dominant one a pinene domino

1835
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:59,199
ocean dominant which which smell what

1836
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,599
flavor do you want and you know

1837
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:03,199
alcohol is a good example people don't i

1838
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,280
mean some people drink every clear all

1839
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,679
the time but even with tequila

1840
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,119
it's like people prefer the flavor and

1841
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,279
then that flavor

1842
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,240
translates to an experience and because

1843
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,798
so much of

1844
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:15,759
the cannabis experience is set in

1845
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:19,519
setting

1846
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,400
it's um it needs to be pleasurable you

1847
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:23,119
know if you

1848
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,039
you take a lung full of anything and it

1849
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:27,280
tastes like a sack of dog poo

1850
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,559
your experience is going to follow but

1851
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,200
if you take a hit of something and

1852
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:33,119
you're like oh my gosh this is amazing

1853
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,558
your experience is going to follow so

1854
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,720
there's this translation

1855
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,720
and i think that's that's what the

1856
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:40,318
consumer is going to ultimately want

1857
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:42,159
is something that tastes good and has a

1858
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:45,599
repeatable experience

1859
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:47,679
and thanks to creating standards that

1860
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,838
make sense like the color coding on the

1861
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,519
the phytoprint on the firefox it's like

1862
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,119
you can kind of create a language to

1863
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:54,639
communicate to the consumer

1864
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,318
that then can translate back to the

1865
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:57,920
producer and the breeder so that

1866
01:04:56,318 --> 01:04:59,759
everybody's talking the same language

1867
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,318
and we're all communicating effectively

1868
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,559
and that

1869
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:04,558
drives purchase decisions and sales

1870
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,000
i need to do that just at that point in

1871
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:12,079
time you'll have the 5g

1872
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,760
chip from the vaccine right directly

1873
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,920
with your point of sale

1874
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,559
for for terpene optimization for your

1875
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,559
genotype

1876
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,160
now um yeah i don't know what's going to

1877
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,639
be in the future i mean

1878
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:29,118
we've seen that the the company from

1879
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:32,639
israel has just taken hold in

1880
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,559
um in san diego there's a company that's

1881
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,838
just moved down there that's got a

1882
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:40,559
license for the technology to use crispr

1883
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,679
um so that's definitely going to be

1884
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,119
coming to the market

1885
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:44,399
pretty soon and that's going to bring a

1886
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,559
whole bunch of different changes in the

1887
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,960
way that we look at breeding

1888
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,839
cannabis at least in the california

1889
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,838
market

1890
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,319
i think that people are going to

1891
01:05:54,159 --> 01:06:00,719
continue to optimize smells and flavors

1892
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,079
and uh yeah we'll kind of see what what

1893
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,798
it brings i hope

1894
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,280
we've moved away from the thc numbers

1895
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,960
people

1896
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:12,640
choosing the weed by in that way but um

1897
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:14,960
who knows yeah the you know trending

1898
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:16,480
wise thc still seems to trump but there

1899
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,920
are people i think that are becoming

1900
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,679
more aware

1901
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,119
as they come more aware their palette

1902
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:22,798
and their experience and

1903
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,318
there's no doubt that you know you can

1904
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,318
use the same cultivar

1905
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:27,838
over and over again and it just starts

1906
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:29,599
to lose its edge

1907
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:31,279
and then someone you know come in with

1908
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,880
something that's just you know could be

1909
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,599
half the potency but it's a it's a

1910
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,079
unique

1911
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,240
uh new chemical profile and it has you

1912
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,519
know incredible effects or even stronger

1913
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:42,000
effects of what they were using

1914
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:43,199
in some cases we find that from a retail

1915
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,960
level a lot of people have to kind of

1916
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,719
bounce around you know they're

1917
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,400
they're not kind of staying on something

1918
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:50,000
for too long we'll have a couple staples

1919
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,240
but they're always floating

1920
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,760
new cultivars into their kind of daily

1921
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:57,038
uh weekly regimen

1922
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,240
well variety is the spice of life as my

1923
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,200
father uses that

1924
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,639
so all consumers are looking for same

1925
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:06,558
same but different

1926
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:06,558
yeah i agree um well yeah

1927
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,960
it's different though today i mean again

1928
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:12,239
like you can't

1929
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,838
like you think mark was saying you used

1930
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:15,199
to be able to go and see your dealer and

1931
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:16,798
stick your nose in a bag or a jar and

1932
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:18,000
see if you like the smile and you'd turn

1933
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:20,159
you would choose what you were going to

1934
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,318
buy if there was choice at all

1935
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:24,399
you would choose based on you know

1936
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,440
organoleptic measures right on how it

1937
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,920
made you

1938
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,119
feel or smell or whatever whatever you

1939
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,440
like the smell of

1940
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,720
um and we kind of totally [ __ ] up that

1941
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,920
game it's like now

1942
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:36,000
it's like mark said everybody's

1943
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,760
everything's done by lab report

1944
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,318
and you can't see or touch the butt at

1945
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,839
least in the canadian regulated market

1946
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:43,358
you know it's got to be in an opaque

1947
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:46,078
container and you can't uh

1948
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,038
you can't smell it yeah um you know

1949
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,798
they'll have jars

1950
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,280
they'll have these jars open on the

1951
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:53,038
counter or at least they did pre-covet

1952
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,839
that you could pick up and smell but

1953
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,599
you know they certainly weren't

1954
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:57,038
replacing it with fresh product every

1955
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,960
day

1956
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,400
um states is the same way i think you

1957
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,679
know with the exception maybe oklahoma

1958
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,519
and a couple others you know that kind

1959
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,318
of let you you know put your face in it

1960
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:07,838
so to speak

1961
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:10,400
um yeah everyone's trying to transition

1962
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:12,000
i don't want to buy anybody he's like we

1963
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,880
that they've shoved up their nose either

1964
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,318
but

1965
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,199
you know like there is there's got to be

1966
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:19,039
a happy medium um

1967
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:21,198
i think we'll move a little bit away

1968
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:25,198
from some of these medical regulations

1969
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:27,678
and we'll have we will have like

1970
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:29,439
medical formulated products that are

1971
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,880
probably better and more accurate than

1972
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,039
they are today

1973
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,239
uh we'll have more diversity of

1974
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:36,560
non-flower

1975
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:38,479
product formats on the market

1976
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,440
everything's shifting i mean if you look

1977
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:41,599
at like a

1978
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:43,439
new jersey i think application that

1979
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,880
they're doing i think lounges so

1980
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,238
you know maybe it can go back to the way

1981
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,759
it kind of used to be you know in

1982
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:50,158
holland where you could get a little bit

1983
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:50,880
you know try it out on the spot if you

1984
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:53,759
liked it

1985
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,359
you go down and buy a little bit more um

1986
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,719
that speaks to the whole you know like

1987
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:00,719
our using our own

1988
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:02,399
organoleptic um bio assay

1989
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,759
we have you have to have that previous

1990
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,879
experience for

1991
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:10,238
it to hit that nose so like if you if

1992
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,640
if you never tried haze for instance um

1993
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:14,479
and you walk into a dispensary and you

1994
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,159
smell haze you don't make that instant

1995
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:17,599
connection that association with the

1996
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:18,960
effect that's associated with that

1997
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,199
terpene profile

1998
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,560
so what we're seeing now in california

1999
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,399
you know specifically is

2000
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,000
we're driven towards these really loud

2001
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:27,759
terpene profiles

2002
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,238
that people have an instant connection

2003
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,520
with because they're they relate to

2004
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,599
other products in their lives for

2005
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,000
instance you know so

2006
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,000
you have to we we have to kind of give

2007
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,198
people that opportunity through having

2008
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,640
things like terpene

2009
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:44,479
classes and guiding them more towards

2010
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,359
what effects are associated with those

2011
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,759
terpenes

2012
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,000
so that they can learn that hey me as a

2013
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:52,399
person i want this profile

2014
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,679
if you just let them go drive by their

2015
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,679
nose and they don't have

2016
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,960
any previous experience with all these

2017
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,880
different varieties

2018
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,640
then they don't get it and i see that a

2019
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,279
lot with the with the youth now

2020
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,000
who don't haven't experienced these

2021
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:07,759
spicy

2022
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,520
herbaceous woodsy old-school african and

2023
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,119
you know haze varieties and stuff like

2024
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,840
that that when they smell them

2025
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,800
it smells woody and and funky and

2026
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,239
resonate

2027
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,840
it doesn't take them anywhere because

2028
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:19,279
they don't have that history yeah yeah

2029
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,560
exactly they don't get that instant

2030
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:23,439
connection where they just

2031
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,920
you know they know so it's we can't let

2032
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:26,479
the

2033
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,679
the consumer guide the direction that

2034
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:29,439
the breeders take us in

2035
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,199
the way they are now because the

2036
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:32,639
consumer isn't the market's not mature

2037
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:33,599
enough for them to have made the right

2038
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,520
decisions

2039
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,600
yeah it's part of the artisan too um

2040
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,520
unfortunately um

2041
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,640
mark had to had to part ways he's a busy

2042
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,159
man today

2043
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,159
um and we're getting right here towards

2044
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:47,279
the end so this one's a bigger

2045
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,639
question and um you know you can't

2046
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:50,960
really talk about the future without

2047
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:54,000
talking about things like crispr

2048
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,198
or gmos or gene editing or any of this

2049
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,319
stuff and i know

2050
01:10:55,198 --> 01:11:00,079
um ryan you you you mentioned crispr on

2051
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:00,719
your last comments i'll pick on you here

2052
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:02,800
a little bit

2053
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,760
and and yeah how do you how do you see

2054
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,199
this

2055
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:11,600
technology coming into play here

2056
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:14,319
and i guess how what does it mean to you

2057
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,840
in the future cannabis yeah i kind of

2058
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:17,279
put crispr in with other forms of

2059
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,400
biotechnology

2060
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:23,439
um that we haven't really even touched

2061
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:24,960
at all upon but

2062
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,639
you know there's there's there's

2063
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,480
breeding you know people talk about

2064
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,560
genetics and it's usually focused on

2065
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,158
either the plant seeds or the breeding

2066
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,520
techniques that we use to make those

2067
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:35,119
plant seeds

2068
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,880
but we're now living in a world where

2069
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:37,920
there's all sorts of technologies like

2070
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,920
crispr so

2071
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:44,800
crispr is like you can think of it like

2072
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,840
a word processor for genes like we can

2073
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,920
go in and

2074
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,239
correct the misspelling of a genetic

2075
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,000
word right or train or change the

2076
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:55,839
genetic spelling of a word and make it

2077
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,840
mean something else

2078
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,679
and that's that's really cool but it's

2079
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,520
like a one-time thing that we do to

2080
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:08,719
change a trait

2081
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:10,719
and it's kind of a shortcut

2082
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,840
you kind of like you know we used to do

2083
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,840
something called ems

2084
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,159
mutation breeding where you'd you take

2085
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,679
plant seeds and you'd subject them to a

2086
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:18,639
chemical mutagen that would change the

2087
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,399
dna

2088
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,760
in little spots just randomly and then

2089
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:23,920
you grow the seeds out and see what

2090
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,880
changed and usually that kind of thing

2091
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,399
is reserved

2092
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,119
for inducing variation in species that

2093
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:32,479
don't have

2094
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:33,920
variation which is very different from

2095
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:35,599
cannabis because canada like i said

2096
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,158
before cannabis has all this

2097
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,840
genetic variation because it breeds like

2098
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:40,719
humans do like it doesn't breed to

2099
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,960
itself

2100
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:44,800
naturally it it normally breeds to a

2101
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,960
male or female plant

2102
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,360
um that's a sibling or that's growing in

2103
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,319
the same patch or a nearby patch

2104
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:53,839
right um and so we can use these methods

2105
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:57,519
like tilling or eco

2106
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:59,279
tilling which is a method for kind of

2107
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,719
figuring out what these you know

2108
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:03,279
isolating these these

2109
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:06,158
genetic rare genetic changes and

2110
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:09,759
figuring out what they do

2111
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:10,960
uh um you know so that's kind of on the

2112
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,600
breeding end but

2113
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,960
there's also this whole technology that

2114
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,039
we can do and i think everybody kind of

2115
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,439
understands you know with immunization

2116
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:19,760
and

2117
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,960
and vaccines going around you know the

2118
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,440
idea that you

2119
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:26,079
you you get this vaccine and it's it's a

2120
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:26,639
virus or a genetic instruction to

2121
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:28,719
produce a

2122
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,840
protein that kind of triggers your

2123
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,560
immune system and prepares it for the

2124
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,800
incoming um

2125
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,600
onslaught of a of an organism right that

2126
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,719
you that you're

2127
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:41,280
that your immune system hasn't seen

2128
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,279
um and you can do that same thing with

2129
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,599
plants i mean we talked last time about

2130
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:46,719
plant viruses and one of the reasons why

2131
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,120
tissue culture is

2132
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,319
useful is we can remove viruses from

2133
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:53,198
from plant lines

2134
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:53,920
plant cell lines but you can also use

2135
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:56,158
you know

2136
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,840
their kind of forms of biotechnology to

2137
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:01,679
like you know something called

2138
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,960
um vigs or

2139
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:07,039
viral induced genes silencing right

2140
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,319
so you can use you can infect the plant

2141
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,880
with um

2142
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:12,960
a virus that might not do anything too

2143
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,719
problematic to the plant

2144
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:19,359
but it it has a gene

2145
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:21,119
that would interfere with a virus if the

2146
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:23,519
virus ever came along

2147
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:25,920
right and so you can actually like

2148
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,000
engineer immunity into these plants from

2149
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:30,158
specific viruses

2150
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,600
um and there's a whole bunch of

2151
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:33,839
different ways that you can do that and

2152
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,480
it's a whole field on its own that's

2153
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,679
you know cyber could post a host of talk

2154
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:38,879
on it but

2155
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,319
it's something that's gonna come to

2156
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,560
cannabis and we're gonna start seeing

2157
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:45,039
plants that are

2158
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,080
genetically enhanced to be able to deal

2159
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:48,960
with

2160
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:51,279
viruses or other pathogens that that

2161
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,600
exist in the environment

2162
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:56,000
rob what's your thoughts on some of the

2163
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:59,600
gmo potential with

2164
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,039
with cannabis i think it's all

2165
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,360
fascinating it's

2166
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,800
it's the future obviously how far down

2167
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:08,000
the road the future

2168
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,159
manifests is another story but like

2169
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,679
ryan's been saying

2170
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:13,920
we really need to straighten out the

2171
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:15,440
genome and

2172
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,119
before we start doing too many

2173
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:18,639
complicated things not just

2174
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:20,800
looking for triploids which just

2175
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:23,679
multiply the existing genome

2176
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,159
but understanding the genome better

2177
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:28,079
through

2178
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:30,158
sequencing and before we start

2179
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,679
messing around with specific parts of it

2180
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,559
we need to know what those specific

2181
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,679
parts are

2182
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:39,039
and what they control um

2183
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:40,719
one of my i like

2184
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:42,399
how ryan has said that basically

2185
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,158
christopher you just lump some of the

2186
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:46,399
other biotech techniques

2187
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:48,559
and i think as far as as where we are

2188
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:51,920
with cannabis that's appropriate

2189
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,960
um i have a question of my own about

2190
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,000
crispr

2191
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,560
what i've learned about it is it seems

2192
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,520
to be an excellent way to locate

2193
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,560
and negate as in snippet out of the

2194
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,840
genome

2195
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,080
a particular dna combination

2196
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,199
which could be a gene for a specific

2197
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:12,559
trait

2198
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:14,879
but i've not seen much evidence for what

2199
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,080
everybody dreams about the crispr can be

2200
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,679
used to

2201
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:24,238
not just edit by deletion but edit by

2202
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:27,679
substitution of another gene combination

2203
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:31,759
so where is crispr with other plants

2204
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:34,079
at um in terms of that

2205
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:36,079
as christopher used to actually insert a

2206
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:37,840
gene or just delete a gene

2207
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:39,600
yeah no you can totally do it like for

2208
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,560
example you can insert purple

2209
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,120
into a plant line right and even have it

2210
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,280
express

2211
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:46,800
under under specific conditions but yeah

2212
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:48,639
you could take

2213
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,039
a white flower and make the flower

2214
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:55,360
purple with inserting one gene

2215
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:56,800
right it's like the way i describe it

2216
01:16:55,359 --> 01:17:00,238
rob is it's kind of like a

2217
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:03,279
um like a jig is for

2218
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:04,639
for carpentry right it's like

2219
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:06,559
you know it's say you're cutting it

2220
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,800
you're cutting

2221
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,600
a table you put a jig on your table and

2222
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,119
then you can

2223
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:15,679
cut out a very specific of the table and

2224
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:16,319
take another piece and cut it back in

2225
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,158
right

2226
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:19,359
and so the christopher what you're

2227
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:21,920
talking about the least

2228
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:25,039
deletions or what's called a loss of

2229
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:27,359
function mutation

2230
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:30,000
you you can disrupt even just a couple

2231
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:33,439
of base pairs or you might cut out like

2232
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,760
3 or 10 or 20 base pairs and that that's

2233
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:37,039
enough to destroy the gene

2234
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,360
the other thing that you can do with

2235
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:41,840
crispr is you can cut in a different

2236
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:42,799
variant right like a different genetic

2237
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,039
variant

2238
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:46,239
that that you know so if you had for

2239
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:48,319
example

2240
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:50,079
you know in in in they were talking

2241
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:51,359
about eye colors and humans

2242
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:53,840
if you're right at the beginning of the

2243
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:56,960
cell you know you can take out a

2244
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:59,440
a mutant blue-eyed gene version

2245
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,640
and cut back in a version that was

2246
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:04,000
pigmented

2247
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,640
right let's say you know a human example

2248
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
from

2249
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,840
you know we're talking about plants but

2250
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,600
it's really yeah

2251
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,000
designer babies is definitely a really

2252
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,280
good yeah

2253
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,198
but i mean it's it's kind of what we're

2254
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:18,559
talking about with plants too i mean if

2255
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:19,439
if the whiteness of a petal was the

2256
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,039
result of a

2257
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:26,079
lost anthocyanin gene or a mutated

2258
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:26,399
anthocyanin gene my point is rob is that

2259
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:28,719
you

2260
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:29,519
cut back in a functional copy of that

2261
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,560
gene

2262
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:34,960
right um the thing about crispr is it's

2263
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,800
like it's really tied with

2264
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,239
tissue culture because it happens on a

2265
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,560
single cellular level

2266
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:41,759
like we're not talking crisp or take a

2267
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,159
plant and dip it in

2268
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,280
in crisper juice and all of a sudden it

2269
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:47,679
starts growing

2270
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:49,119
um you know like these changes have to

2271
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:52,640
happen at a genetic

2272
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:54,479
level and those changes have to be

2273
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:57,760
consistent and true

2274
01:18:54,479 --> 01:19:00,000
for every cell that grow that every cell

2275
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,039
line that grows out of the mutated or

2276
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,640
the the crispr cell if you will

2277
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,719
right and so it's kind of a two-step

2278
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,480
process where

2279
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,480
you're making these changes on a very

2280
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,718
small group of cells

2281
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,238
that all incorporate that trait and then

2282
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,439
when those cells grow and then then you

2283
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:16,079
have to grow those cells into a full

2284
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:18,319
plant

2285
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:19,920
right and once it's in the plant you can

2286
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:21,359
breed it like any other trade

2287
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,719
right it's not something that we keep

2288
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:26,238
doing on but uh you keep doing

2289
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,760
you know you have to keep going over and

2290
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:30,319
over again right

2291
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,800
once once you've crispered a trait into

2292
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:34,319
a cell line or a plant you can then

2293
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,079
pass that trait through using

2294
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:38,719
traditional breeding methods

2295
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:39,840
sure mojave what's what's your take

2296
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,439
because you've got such a

2297
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,000
interesting kind of upbringing you know

2298
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:45,678
your second generation california grower

2299
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,039
um now we're starting to talk about

2300
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,119
almost it's almost like if

2301
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:50,319
silicon valley were to move into santa

2302
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:51,679
cruz county which

2303
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:53,519
actually technically they've been doing

2304
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,079
for a while now but you have this kind

2305
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,800
of like

2306
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:58,399
elon musk technology here uh which is

2307
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,920
very different than kind of on the core

2308
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:01,198
fundamental beliefs of that you were

2309
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,319
raised on and

2310
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:05,919
a lot of your breeding approaches um

2311
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:07,279
i i ethically i don't think there's

2312
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,719
anything wrong with it if it's done

2313
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:11,920
responsibly

2314
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:13,600
um but i think that um

2315
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,800
we're just a long ways away as we've

2316
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,239
kind of been highlighting throughout

2317
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,719
this conversation that

2318
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:20,399
traditional breeding techniques are key

2319
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,840
to get to the starting point

2320
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:26,559
for for um more advanced techniques

2321
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,639
you know and i think that since we kind

2322
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:32,400
of skipped over that process

2323
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:33,840
we you know we we have to pick we have

2324
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,879
to select the plants that we want to

2325
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,920
improve

2326
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:41,359
first you know crispr you know if

2327
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:43,199
we're if we're editing in a single trait

2328
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:44,799
we want a variety that's close to that

2329
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:46,079
trait that we're trying to edit in right

2330
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,440
we don't want to take a a

2331
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:52,559
small leafy variety and

2332
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:54,479
turn it into a tall chunky variety

2333
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,840
right we want it we want to get as close

2334
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:58,799
as possible and

2335
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,679
i think that you know we we owe it to

2336
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,520
consumers

2337
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:03,440
cannabis the environment everyone to

2338
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:06,400
kind of fully explore

2339
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:07,279
what was already there you know like i i

2340
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:10,719
kind of like

2341
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:12,800
compared to there was this book um

2342
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:14,319
and documentary a few years ago called

2343
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:18,320
the journey of man

2344
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:19,920
and we it was a a project where we're

2345
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:21,920
trying to collect genetic information

2346
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,359
from its many isolated populations

2347
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,158
around the world

2348
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:27,599
um and kind of the what came out of that

2349
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:28,238
is that that happened at just the right

2350
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,400
time

2351
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:32,319
had it happened 10 years later all those

2352
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:34,238
populations would have intermingled

2353
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:36,079
and we wouldn't have had the information

2354
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:37,439
that we knew about the human genome or

2355
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:40,079
it would have been a lot harder

2356
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:42,319
to parse out how the story of how

2357
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:44,479
mankind came out of africa and spread

2358
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:46,399
into all these different you know

2359
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:48,158
populations around the world and i think

2360
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:51,679
it's similar with cannabis that

2361
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:52,960
you know we you know we were isolated

2362
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:55,600
for so long

2363
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:56,000
um just geographically and then we were

2364
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,480
forced

2365
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,079
into isolation through prohibition and

2366
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:00,638
then we all came out of that kind of

2367
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:02,319
racing

2368
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:04,480
towards this new modern cannabis

2369
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:08,399
industry but we skipped over

2370
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:10,319
this this slower more progressive

2371
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:12,319
stage of kind of going through all these

2372
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:13,599
different populations to see what value

2373
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:17,119
that they had

2374
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:18,880
and i think that is is is important

2375
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:20,639
especially for the traditional farmer

2376
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,880
you know who doesn't have access to

2377
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:24,880
a lot of these tools one

2378
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:31,279
the people who have the tools it it's

2379
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,279
important to do those things i mean

2380
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,560
we're talking about like 35 of us but i

2381
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:37,599
believe it was a caucasian man that was

2382
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,760
first sequenced

2383
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,880
right and so it's like great we've got

2384
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,760
one genome

2385
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,279
full genome of of one white guy right

2386
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,199
like what does that really tell us about

2387
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:49,039
the genetic variation across the species

2388
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:51,678
not a hell of a lot

2389
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:53,279
right so eventually if you know and it's

2390
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,840
sequencing was really damn expensive to

2391
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:56,238
do it

2392
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,079
back then but now we can sequence

2393
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:59,198
genomes really quickly and for not very

2394
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:02,238
much money

2395
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:03,039
so it became about doing what was called

2396
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:07,839
the thousand

2397
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:09,840
genomes project right where we sequence

2398
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,039
genomes from a thousand different people

2399
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,560
men and women

2400
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:14,719
of all different colors and genetic

2401
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:17,199
backgrounds from all over the planet

2402
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,840
and that way you can look at any given

2403
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:19,359
gene

2404
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,800
and look for the variation within those

2405
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:22,479
genes and you know even a thousand

2406
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,199
genomes you're not going to capture the

2407
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:25,039
breadth

2408
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,479
of the genetic variation within the

2409
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:28,079
species like really

2410
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:30,479
you need ten thousand or a hundred

2411
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:33,119
thousand um

2412
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:34,959
genomes and and even as you sequence

2413
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:38,079
more like you're going to randomly find

2414
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,239
new mutations right but

2415
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:42,479
essentially those alleles or those

2416
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:45,519
genetic variants or snips

2417
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:47,678
um there's a catalog

2418
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,239
of them right within the species like

2419
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:52,480
there's a set of alleles

2420
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:53,759
that the species produces and we don't

2421
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:55,759
know what

2422
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,960
those sets are we're starting to learn

2423
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,159
about it with some of the work that a

2424
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,039
candimer did with

2425
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:01,920
um you know the genetic variants of the

2426
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:03,760
thc

2427
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:07,760
synthase but that kind of variation that

2428
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,760
you see in the cannabinoid

2429
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,198
production genes i'm willing to bet you

2430
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:12,799
know

2431
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:14,879
anything that those that type of

2432
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,360
variation is seen

2433
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,920
almost all the way across the genome and

2434
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:19,439
like

2435
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,119
you might not see it in some very

2436
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:22,638
important housekeeping

2437
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:24,479
genes that have to do with like cellular

2438
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:26,239
division or whatever

2439
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:28,879
you know photosynthesis some of those

2440
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:31,119
things are more more highly conserved

2441
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:34,639
but every other trait you're going to

2442
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:37,679
see a level of genetic variation

2443
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:39,440
and really what sequencing is going to

2444
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:42,480
allow us to do

2445
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:45,519
is make a catalog of that variation

2446
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:46,079
at every genetic locus or every genetic

2447
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,000
spot

2448
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:50,479
on the chromosome and once we understand

2449
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,119
what those

2450
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:53,678
variants are and what they uh what they

2451
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:57,359
confer

2452
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:58,960
to the plant or or to the biological

2453
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:00,479
pathways of the plant

2454
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,319
then we're going to be able to put those

2455
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:03,519
things together or reassemble those

2456
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:06,158
things using

2457
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,760
breeding techniques in a different way

2458
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:10,839
um to really create

2459
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:12,480
optimized plants right but we've got a

2460
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:16,560
lot

2461
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:16,559
of discovery to go to get there

2462
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,639
i think the good thing with most uh

2463
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,480
cannabis breeders is they they seem to

2464
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,920
have a decent level of patience

2465
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:25,198
um because yeah we've got to kind of

2466
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,199
wait for things to catch up a bit before

2467
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:28,879
before we're too destructive

2468
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:30,879
um this last question will be for you

2469
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,199
ryan uh to kind of represent uh

2470
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,480
speak on behalf of canada and then

2471
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:35,678
mojave if you don't mind kind of

2472
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:36,718
answering on behalf of you know

2473
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,639
california

2474
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,319
and kind of the general states the

2475
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,560
question is

2476
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,359
uh ryan for you should license producers

2477
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,360
be investing in

2478
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:46,719
in-house plant breeding or maybe is this

2479
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:48,880
something they should be

2480
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:51,359
outsourcing to like a micro license as

2481
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,359
an example

2482
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:56,319
it's tough to do with a micro license

2483
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,639
you can probably do some screening but

2484
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:58,399
like

2485
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,760
real breeding i don't know you can

2486
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:02,000
really grow a thousand plants

2487
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,000
um

2488
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,319
i i think we're gonna see both types

2489
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,880
like set that company

2490
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:09,840
from israel and set up shop down in san

2491
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,520
diego

2492
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,719
i think they're called canbreed they're

2493
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:18,000
going to cater to a larger clientele

2494
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:20,639
probably more corporate um

2495
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,800
i think it really depends on the size of

2496
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:26,639
the company

2497
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:28,960
genetic innovation is important but

2498
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,000
you know most wineries are growing the

2499
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,039
same old wine

2500
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,520
grapes that they have been for

2501
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,800
you know hundreds of years um and just

2502
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,320
taking pride in

2503
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,880
doing that one type and doing it really

2504
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:41,359
well so i think that we'll probably see

2505
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,119
people

2506
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:46,319
that they figure out a cultivar that

2507
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:48,158
really works for them and

2508
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:50,399
they like and they produce really well

2509
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:52,238
and it's received really well

2510
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:54,638
consistently on the marketplace and

2511
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:56,319
they'll specialize in that

2512
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:58,239
maybe play around with a little bit but

2513
01:26:56,319 --> 01:27:00,079
i think that like you know any any

2514
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:01,519
square foot that you dedicate to r d

2515
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:03,439
is not a square foot that you're pretty

2516
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,960
no it's expensive it's expensive too

2517
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:06,319
from a capex standpoint

2518
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,319
you know when you look at it and there's

2519
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:09,039
obviously risk if you've kind of got

2520
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:12,479
pollen in

2521
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:15,039
in the space and and and and

2522
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:15,519
then you start talking about like i mean

2523
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:17,519
you know

2524
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,280
the amount of cost that it takes to just

2525
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,120
do the chemical analysis it's just the

2526
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:23,920
chemical analysis right or for

2527
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:25,039
even for just beans and cannabinoids

2528
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,480
you're not even looking at

2529
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:27,920
some of these other volatile compounds

2530
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:29,519
or at least maybe you are doing

2531
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,319
volatiles but you're not looking at

2532
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,239
oil content or root you know chemicals

2533
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:36,880
or resistances or chemicals

2534
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:38,879
involve resistance i mean it adds up

2535
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,359
really really really quickly like if

2536
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,400
you're

2537
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:42,079
you know even if you're doing it

2538
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:43,759
in-house and you can get like a hundred

2539
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:45,840
dollar retail test down to thirty

2540
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,719
dollars cost if you're calling a

2541
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,480
thousand plants

2542
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:52,880
that's 30 grand that's right and so

2543
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:54,799
that's you know it's a it's a specific

2544
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,920
business model and it's a specific type

2545
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,520
that's going to understand

2546
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,600
putting that kind of money into r d

2547
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:03,040
leads to a

2548
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,639
like a difference in the marketplace

2549
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:09,600
that gets you an roi

2550
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:09,600
right so i think you see people

2551
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:13,359
that like i think we'll see segmented as

2552
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:15,840
breeding companies

2553
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:17,039
and they'll be some small breeders kind

2554
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,719
of the way they are today and then

2555
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:21,279
they'll be the syngenta

2556
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:22,319
big time players that are doing it big

2557
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:24,238
ag style

2558
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:27,599
with lots of marker assistant selection

2559
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:29,439
and lots of money and public money

2560
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,800
it's interesting how the genetics don't

2561
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:33,919
derive evaluation

2562
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,520
as much in cannabis as they do in

2563
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,480
other traditional crops you know we

2564
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,360
start talking about syngenta and

2565
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:39,519
everything like that

2566
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:40,799
you know the genetics are everything

2567
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,000
they drive a lot of the evaluation but

2568
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,760
for whatever reason

2569
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,600
it's like the infrastructure or the

2570
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,159
sales it's not like oh my genetic

2571
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,000
portfolio it's a tricky one to

2572
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:51,599
put a financial number to the value of

2573
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,279
it for a lot of these companies the

2574
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,079
industry is so young dude that

2575
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:56,000
everybody's

2576
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:57,760
like they're looking at your clothes and

2577
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,840
that's what's inside

2578
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,360
right and there's that that whole

2579
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,039
expression is you know

2580
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:06,000
it's what's inside the counts it's not

2581
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:08,238
what's on the cover right

2582
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
yeah and there's two and there's there's

2583
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:13,039
uh can't build an industry

2584
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,238
you can't build a multi-billion dollar

2585
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:16,719
ag industry

2586
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:17,439
on plants that have been selected by

2587
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,000
like

2588
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:21,678
20 year olds in closets like that's just

2589
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,399
not the way that it works you know what

2590
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:24,000
i mean and

2591
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:26,319
i'm not saying that the 20 year olds in

2592
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,520
closets didn't do a decent job in some

2593
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:30,479
things they did

2594
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:32,719
there was there there are like a few

2595
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:34,879
what i'll call breeding wins but like

2596
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,079
the amount of breeding losses that had

2597
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:39,359
to like

2598
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:42,399
pile up for wins the losses you know

2599
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:44,319
like the ratio is way out of whack and

2600
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,000
i think that as we start treating

2601
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:50,079
cannabis as like a

2602
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,079
a true scaled ag product

2603
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:54,559
you know and again also understanding

2604
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,198
that it's not a widget like you're not

2605
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,800
just trying to

2606
01:29:55,198 --> 01:30:01,119
pump out a million widgets right like

2607
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,159
these are experiences that are that are

2608
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:05,760
touching people

2609
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:06,960
right so i don't know yeah i just add

2610
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,360
that you know it's great

2611
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,079
to for for groups to have proprietary

2612
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:13,439
cultivars

2613
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:16,079
that's that's all good but um it's

2614
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:16,879
not easy and to try to build a brand

2615
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:19,119
around

2616
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,239
a unique cultivar is challenging when

2617
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:21,920
people

2618
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:24,238
circulate through so many different

2619
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,359
cultivars um throughout the years you

2620
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:26,718
know there's

2621
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:28,238
there's uh there's only been a few

2622
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:29,439
companies who've been really successful

2623
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:33,279
doing that but

2624
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:35,678
i think just like ryan's point on grapes

2625
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:37,198
we have to land somewhere eventually

2626
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:40,158
that we hope through all this

2627
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:42,960
this this breeding effort collectively

2628
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:45,119
we get to an end game which is

2629
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,319
particular varieties that are suited for

2630
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:49,198
specific use

2631
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:51,119
in specific regions under specific

2632
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:53,759
cultivation strategies

2633
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:55,039
and then we all utilize those varieties

2634
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,719
as a whole because that's the only way

2635
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:58,719
to make the market really function for

2636
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:00,560
the supply chain to really function

2637
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,800
for the consumers to really understand

2638
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,199
what properties they're getting out of

2639
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,840
their

2640
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:07,759
their cannabis we can't just expect them

2641
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,440
we can't have two three four five

2642
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,880
thousand different choices

2643
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:12,719
and for the hundreds of thousands and

2644
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,520
millions of consumers just to navigate

2645
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:15,198
through that

2646
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:17,280
to select the varieties that work best

2647
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:18,158
for them we collectively have as an

2648
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:20,479
industry

2649
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:22,799
have to develop the pinot noir the

2650
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:23,599
cabernet the merlot the saint gervais

2651
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,840
the

2652
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,840
the cab franc that what all the

2653
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:30,159
different all the different varieties

2654
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,039
i picked only red there but that's my um

2655
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:33,279
anyway right

2656
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:34,719
so we have to get there and once we get

2657
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:36,399
there then you know there's

2658
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:37,760
there's a lot of variety improvement

2659
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:38,879
that can happen i mean there's thousands

2660
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,119
of different

2661
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,920
clones of pinot noir that are available

2662
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:44,238
you know

2663
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,760
but they're all they're all available

2664
01:31:44,238 --> 01:31:48,000
you know and they're all

2665
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,039
they're your your selection for what

2666
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,679
variety you

2667
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:53,279
grow tends to come from you know an

2668
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:55,520
already established

2669
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:57,599
robust industry that knows that this

2670
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,239
particular clone grows well in this

2671
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,440
region

2672
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:03,519
of this particular appellation

2673
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:05,198
so it's you know we have to get there

2674
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,239
first and i think that's a big challenge

2675
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:08,399
and right now

2676
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:09,359
we're so obsessed i mean i hear this

2677
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:12,158
obsession with

2678
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:13,039
um dispensary owners here in california

2679
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:15,599
they have to

2680
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:17,279
constantly pump out the new new because

2681
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,600
the consumer comes in there

2682
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:21,439
wanting this quest they're on this quest

2683
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,199
to find something new

2684
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:24,799
partially i think because they never

2685
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:26,158
land on something that works for them

2686
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:30,159
the right way or they're not

2687
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:31,839
not guided towards the right choice

2688
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:33,519
but we have to make that selection for

2689
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,639
them we can't expect the market to

2690
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:38,639
evolve

2691
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:42,480
based off of this massive diversity

2692
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:44,480
this um this uh this paradox of choice

2693
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:45,919
you know but everyone thinks it's really

2694
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:46,718
it's a fascination right now to

2695
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,279
experience

2696
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:51,119
all that cannabis can be but in order

2697
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:53,198
for the market to mature we kind of have

2698
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:56,479
to land on certain areas so that

2699
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:58,319
that's going to be breeding and

2700
01:32:56,479 --> 01:32:59,599
um you know more than breeding it's

2701
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:00,479
going to be you know kind of what

2702
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,719
production

2703
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:04,000
techniques work best you know and

2704
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:05,439
hopefully we get there and then

2705
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,439
consumers can

2706
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:09,039
can make the right choices and the

2707
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,678
market can mature

2708
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:12,479
but um but right now in california it's

2709
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,800
just a mess

2710
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,319
because it's you know hundreds and

2711
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,960
hundreds of different cultivars that all

2712
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:20,238
have

2713
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:23,760
a very similar effect but consumers

2714
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:24,158
are excited at the hunt you know they go

2715
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,760
from

2716
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:29,198
from dispensary to dispensary and

2717
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:30,400
there's never two menus that look alike

2718
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:32,158
yeah it's really challenging for the

2719
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:33,679
grower you know because especially at

2720
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:36,399
scale to be able to make those

2721
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:38,319
changes based off of market demand and

2722
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:39,920
oftentimes i hear growers you know after

2723
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:40,719
been growing for three or five years

2724
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,399
commercially

2725
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,399
in california say i should have just

2726
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:46,000
grown og kush this whole time

2727
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:48,079
you know or some kind of statement like

2728
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,399
that because it's a it's a classic

2729
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:52,319
thing it was difficult for them to stay

2730
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:54,879
on the edge or on the cusp of

2731
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:56,479
you know what that new new is well it's

2732
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,400
actually impossible i mean no

2733
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:00,319
one person could constantly be at the

2734
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:01,279
edge plant breeding doesn't progress at

2735
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:03,039
that rate

2736
01:34:01,279 --> 01:34:04,399
you know i mean it takes three months to

2737
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:08,399
grow to

2738
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:10,719
to make a seed you know well

2739
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:11,439
sorry four weeks to make a seed but

2740
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:13,679
another

2741
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:15,039
three call it to grow that seed if

2742
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,800
everybody wants something new

2743
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:18,960
in eight months there's just not enough

2744
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:21,600
time to select the new plant

2745
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,158
test it bulk it up into a production

2746
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,280
system

2747
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:28,399
you know it's like that that rate of

2748
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:29,759
desire for something new it's like at

2749
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:30,719
some point it has to be temperate of

2750
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,920
reality

2751
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:35,520
yeah for sure i agree um well as always

2752
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,239
