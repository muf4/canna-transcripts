2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,120
it is taken for granted nowadays that

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,820
healthy soil is alive the ground we walk

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,799
on is live but this was not the case

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,379
just 40 years ago when Western

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,820
agriculture thought of soil more like an

7
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,419
inert robot

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,359
the soil food web methodology describes

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,480
the community of organisms living all or

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,700
part of their lives in the soil it

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,679
describes a complex living system in the

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,079
soil and how it interacts with the

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,119
environment plants and animals it

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,520
describes the Web of Life from large

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,218
animals all the way down to the most

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,180
basic microbiological level in soil and

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,879
water

18
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:50,280
if you really want to grok the soil food

19
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:53,460
web in an instant do an image search

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,500

today for one of my favorites

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,280
the soil food web is at the very core of

25
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,798
regenerative agriculture and not only

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,079
will inform your cultivation efforts to

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,080
help your plants Thrive but it will

28
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,478
inform humanity and how we may heal our

29
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,400
planet before we make it uninhabitable

30
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,379
for ourselves

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,820

you are listening to shapingfire and I'm

67
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,378
your host shangolos my guest today is

68
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,319
soil biologist educator and activist Dr

69
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:42,359
Elaine Ingham Dr Ingham uncovered the

70
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,280
soil food web nearly four decades ago

71
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,980
and has been pioneering research about

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,080
soil food web ever since widely

73
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,939
recognized as the world's foremost soil

74
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,920
biologist she's passionate about

75
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,739
empowering people to bring the soils and

76
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,539
their communities back to life now be

77
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,180
clear when I say that Dr Ingham

78
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,459
uncovered the soil food web because what

79
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,680
I mean is she invented the soil food web

80
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,019
or rather the soil food web

81
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,480
understanding of Nature and then

82
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,219
continue to reach research it and teach

83
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,679
it even though she was getting

84
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:16,019
aggressive pushback from the agriculture

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,659
industry which essentially made her an

86
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,640
activist too simply for trying to

87
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:22,019
publicly describe how soil actually

88
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,378
functions

89
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,360
Dr Elaine's soil food web approach has

90
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:29,579
been used to successfully restore the

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,800
ecological functions of soils on more

92
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,120
than 5 million Acres of Farmland all

93
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,280
over the world

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,739
her professional scientific experience

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,479
is long and impressive and if you want

96
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,819
to know it in detail check out the

97
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,878
Wikipedia page about her

98
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:47,339
Dr Elaine has also established the soil

99
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,919
food web school to educate the next

100
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,598
generation of soil biologists the

101
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,280
courses offered have been designed for

102
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,560
people with or without a science

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,479
background making them accessible to

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,340
individuals who wish to learn and to

105
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,560
begin a meaningful and impactful career

106
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,739
in an area that will help to secure the

107
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,719
survival of humans and other species

108
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,459
I have wanted to invite Elaine to be

109
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,560
special guest on shaping fire for a few

110
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,598
years now but decided to wait until I

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,759
had enough understanding of soil biology

112
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,978
to ask her questions that would be of

113
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,738
interest to you the listener and would

114
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,539
be engaging for Dr Ingham too as a

115
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,638
shaping fire listener you've learned

116
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,919
soil science right alongside me the last

117
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,699
five years You're Gonna Love today's

118
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:32,279
episode and Dr Ingham says she does too

119
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,620
today's episode is not an introduction

120
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,899
to the soil food web if this perspective

121
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,879
is new to you when you're done here I

122
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,978
recommend you jump over to YouTube for

123
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,740
one of the many videos that explain the

124
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,300
basics of the soil food web model

125
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,759
today's episode is a series of

126
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,620
discussion lines that have Arisen from

127
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,900
me actually using the soil food web

128
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,579
insights to grow cannabis and my

129
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,019
discussions with other regenerative

130
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,240
Growers

131
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,339
during the first set we discussed the

132
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,500
use of indigenous microorganisms to

133
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,599
optimize plant resilience and the

134
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,519
overlap between the soil food web and

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,160
the water food web and what that means

136
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,719
for growing cannabis in the second set

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,360
we talk about sterile growing

138
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,820
environments beneficial insects as both

139
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,100
Garden defense and food web antagonist

140
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,860
and how to get Coco core pots as

141
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,620
biologically active as possible

142
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,960
finally we finished the episode in set 3

143
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,060
with a discussion of the timely use of

144
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,399
aerated compost teas and compost

145
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,639
extracts and bringing the soil food web

146
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:35,659
techniques indoors for cultivation

147
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,220
welcome to shaping fire Dr Elaine

148
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm I'm very happy to be here this is

149
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,820
going to be fun yeah I'm so glad to

150
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,579
finally have you on the show

151
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,219
so you know many of us aspire to

152
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,959
strengthen every level of the soil food

153
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,600
web in our garden so you know we can

154
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,719
most effectively play its Melody and

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,660
this often includes the use of incubated

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,840
indigenous microorganisms known by most

157
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,120
folks is imos but cannabis plants are

158
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,399
not indigenous to many of the regions of

159
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,740
the world where we cultivate it are

160
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:11,099
there ways to make the cannabis plants

161
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,500
feel more at home in the environments

162
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,800
where naturally they never establish

163
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,879
themselves like how can we make

164
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,520
non-indigenous plants that we grow

165
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,918
connect more fully with the local

166
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,719
biology

167
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:28,918
um we're actually doing a really good

168
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,960
job of doing that already the damage

169
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,659
that we do to our soil when we till it

170
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,478
when we put out these salts the

171
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,800
inorganic fertilizers are all salts and

172
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:43,399
that's definitely plain Havoc with those

173
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,020
microorganisms that might have

174
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:49,318
prevented cannabis from being able to

175
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:51,899
grow in their particular system so we're

176
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,720
already doing the things to a great deal

177
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,519
that would allow or would

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,639
um

179
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:02,579
select for the for cannabis

180
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,460
um you know so as human beings change

181
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:08,279
things we alter we are making a better

182
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,599
and better environment for cannabis and

183
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,359
so we're already

184
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,240
making things better to grow cannabis

185
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,060
because it it is a plant that needs

186
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,720
somewhere between like a 0.5 ratio of

187
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,259
fungi to bacteria up to maybe one to one

188
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,419
equal biomassobacterium fungi and then

189
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,479
there are values that we're looking at

190
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:31,339
you know does your does cannabis need at

191
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,399
least

192
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:38,818
135 micrograms of bacteria and fungi

193
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,739
or can it's gonna is it actually gonna

194
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,500
do better if we have a little more

195
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,019
bacteria so the bacteria are up at 400

196
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,740
micrograms per gram whereas the fungi

197
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:53,659
are a half or you know even less than

198
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,519
that and will depends on the um on the

199
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,580
species or the subspecies of cannabis

200
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,680
that you're growing as well so I think

201
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:04,978
we're already doing everything necessary

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,259
to grow cannabis all over the world

203
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:09,180
your answer is surprising and if I

204
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,120
understand it correctly disheartening

205
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,120
because what I think you just said is

206
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,120
um because we are eroding the strength

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,180
of our soil globally it has less defense

208
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,699
mechanisms and is therefore

209
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,519
um creating a wider environment for

210
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,978
cannabis because we're destroying the

211
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,318
soil you know I is that about what you

212
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,899
said that's really basically what I said

213
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,240
gosh

214
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:38,639
all right great for cannabis Growers but

215
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,299
not so great if you want to be growing

216
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:45,059
grapevines or shrubs or different kinds

217
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,579
of you know the highly productive grass

218
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,219
species for example yeah or or you know

219
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,740
food that has nutrition and all the

220
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,560
other things that we need to survive

221
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,200
um gosh all right so um I'm gonna uh

222
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,659
slightly change the question then to to

223
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,140
tease out something else so so even

224
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:06,179
though uh we humans by eroding and

225
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,600
degrading the soil are actually making

226
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:11,699
it more appropriate for cannabis

227
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:15,180
when we do move when we do bring

228
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,519
cannabis plants into areas where

229
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,199
um perhaps the the weather is something

230
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,240
that they're not used to or the

231
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,220
indigenous microorganisms are not what

232
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,100
they're used to even though there is

233
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,720
eroded soil and so we're getting the you

234
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
know the the ph and the parts per

235
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,040
million that might be more appropriate

236
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,640
for cannabis growing are there other

237
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:39,179
things that we can do to decrease

238
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:41,939
um uh you know weather and and transport

239
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,620
shock for plants because so often

240
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,959
cultivators are moving their plants

241
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,539
multiple times from from a from a

242
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:52,619
nursery to a grout grow out greenhouse

243
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:54,240
and then finally into the ground and

244
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,419
um absolutely I think there would be

245
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,659
things we could do to make it easier on

246
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:03,838
the specific plants

247
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:05,458
in that process of dealing with a root

248
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,800
system that's getting bigger and bigger

249
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:10,259
and bigger uh

250
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,740
what we really want to do is give it

251
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:18,419
depth because properly grown out in the

252
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:20,879
real world cannabis usually will broaden

253
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:23,579
those root systems will be you know

254
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,338
certain diameter from around those

255
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,879
around the main stems but then those

256
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,760
roots tend to grow should grow down

257
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,360
they're looking for water that that they

258
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:39,299
have to have in the dry seasons of the

259
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,039
year and so if they've got proper

260
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,559
structure built in the soil if they have

261
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,179
the bacterium fungi present that will

262
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,219
build that kind of structure the

263
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,739
protozoa the nematodes that will help to

264
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,620
build that structure then the roots of

265
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,500
your plants will go down quite deep and

266
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,539
you know we see cannabis with root

267
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:03,179
systems down at 12 feet 15 feet 20 feet

268
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:06,019
depending I'm I think on the cultivars

269
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:08,778
the type of cannabis that you're growing

270
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:11,940
so when we're are thinking about

271
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:14,879
transferring from something that grew up

272
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,279
in the you know little the small

273
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,778
containers in the greenhouse and now

274
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,679
we're going to put them into larger

275
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:24,240
containers it's not diameter of the

276
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,039
container that you want to think about

277
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,159
it's the height

278
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,199
of the

279
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,199
growing the the container that you're

280
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,079
going to be growing that

281
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,980
cannabis in because we want to mimic we

282
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:43,319
want to have things be more like those

283
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,659
plants are used to out in the real world

284
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,839
and and they have a drive

285
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:50,578
to get those root systems deep I'm sure

286
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,980
almost everybody is you know when

287
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:55,559
they've pulled up a cannabis plant and

288
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,220
they look at the bottom and they see the

289
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:02,759
roots just going in circles against the

290
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,700
bottom of the pot that is not good for

291
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:09,419
the plant you have developed typically

292
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,640
have developed an anaerobic condition in

293
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:15,120
those root systems trying to escape

294
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,399
trying to get down and deeper into the

295
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,519
soil you've made an anaerobic little

296
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,458
cubby area that will grow diseases and

297
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,039
pests incredibly well not going to grow

298
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,119
the right sets of microorganisms for the

299
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,838
cannabis

300
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,899
cannabis root systems obligately aerobic

301
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,959
you've got to have oxygen in there or

302
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,299
they're going to succumb to a number of

303
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,699
different stresses

304
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,740
um clearly growing in

305
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,259
um in the earth is best so that those

306
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,419
those roots can reach far and

307
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:51,778
participate in whatever's happening in

308
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:53,519
the soil food web at that depth plus get

309
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:56,879
their own water

310
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,480
um is there is there anything that we

311
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,578
can do as as Growers because so many of

312
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,399
us grow in containers that might be

313
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:09,299
somewhere between you know 20 50 or up

314
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,519
to 300 gallon pots but they still don't

315
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:16,019
go very deep they usually expand out

316
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,720
wider instead of getting deeper and so

317
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:23,399
um uh is there anything that we can do

318
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,180
to to help the roots from becoming you

319
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,339
know

320
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,500
um you know anaerobic at the bottom for

321
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,720
example anything like as simple as as

322
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,419
making sure to use linen pots which let

323
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,800
some air go through go through or

324
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:37,379
um is there is there anything that we

325
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:41,578
can do out of that bad situation

326
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:44,278
yeah I if we get the food web into that

327
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:46,078
soil such that there's a lot of nutrient

328
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,419
cycling there's a lot of protection

329
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:51,599
there's a lot of building structure so

330
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:55,019
water is held right at the top of that

331
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,899
interface going going down so the plant

332
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:01,740
is getting all the things it needs from

333
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:03,259
a shallower pot we could maybe reduce

334
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,120
that stress

335
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:08,639
and so trying some of this out and

336
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,100
finding out okay how wide does something

337
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,700
have to be versus the depth that it's

338
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,278
going and and that's that's just

339
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:20,160
research that hasn't been done I know a

340
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,078
number of labs have said oh yeah we

341
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,819
should do that but I haven't seen any

342
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,379
data back and

343
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,860
um it's been a while since I've actually

344
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:31,860
been growing any cannabis just too many

345
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,860
other things happening totally

346
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,539
um I like what you said about you know

347
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,700
we will help the root system out by

348
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:41,759
making sure it's part participating as

349
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,920
much in the soil food web and just

350
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,919
briefly on the last episode I spoke with

351
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,019
one of your students Andy Marsh and and

352
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,778
and she was talking about

353
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:55,100
um you know biological inoculants

354
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:58,379
um not of particular nutrition but of

355
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,879
residents of the rhizosphere

356
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,799
um do you have

357
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:06,059
um you know any suggestions for

358
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:07,979
inoculating our soil with actual you

359
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,439
know living beings instead of just

360
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,879
nutrition

361
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,639
well that's really what we're talking

362
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,578
about when we're we're discussing

363
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,240
um soil biology it's the organisms going

364
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:22,859
it's the living part of that soil

365
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,320
um that we're concerned about because

366
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,860
it's the living organisms those things

367
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,480
doing their jobs so you don't have to do

368
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,639
them

369
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,339
um is really what we're trying to do we

370
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,079
want to understand the function of all

371
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:40,079
these different microorganisms in the

372
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:42,000
soil and you know most people have a

373
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,458
hard time believing that there's that

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,458
many species of bacteria and species of

375
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:51,599
fungi and in both cases bacteria and

376
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:55,018
fungi were up in the millions hundreds

377
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,959
of millions of individual species and

378
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:01,039
they're different in different

379
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,599
ecosystems so we wanna

380
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,599
obtain

381
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,459
a community of bacteria and a fungi and

382
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,040
a protozoa and nematodes we want them

383
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:13,319
all to be good guys and I know some

384
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,259
people cringe when I don't use technical

385
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,699
scientific terms but I think it makes

386
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,980
more sense to say we want the

387
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,539
beneficials that will help your plant

388
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,000
grow and where are you going to go out

389
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:27,740
there and find them and find them for

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,539
the biome that you're already living in

391
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:33,480
someday that cannabis plant is going to

392
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:36,480
be planted outside and it's going to

393
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,100
have to deal with the conditions of a

394
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,959
normal summer

395
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,500
in whatever part of the world you're in

396
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:46,500
and so you want to make certain that the

397
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,860
maximum protection from the species

398
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,958
subspecies a bacteria and fungi protozoa

399
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,000
and nematodes and microarthropods and

400
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,518
earthworms and in catrides and I could

401
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,278
keep going but I lose most people

402
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,480
typically about in there wait a minute I

403
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,179
didn't know there were that many

404
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,939
different types of yeah they are and you

405
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:09,899
need them all your plant needs them all

406
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:11,519
to do the jobs that you otherwise are

407
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,339
going to get stuck doing if you don't

408
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:17,519
have your willing organic workers in

409
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:19,980
that soil for your plant so we want to

410
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:23,519
maximize diversity how do you do that

411
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:27,838
we're going to have you go out into the

412
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:29,039
area around where you're living where

413
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,619
are you going to be planting the

414
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,099
cannabis for you know those cannabis

415
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:36,859
that are going to display the particular

416
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:40,740
flavors or tastes

417
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:43,439
you know know what all is going to be in

418
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,900
that cannabis plant you're going to want

419
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,460
to maximize diversity so you go out with

420
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,840
your collection bag and it doesn't have

421
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,360
to be real large

422
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,000
it could be a little Ziploc sandwich

423
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,000
size or you know court size

424
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,740
um baggy

425
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,940
and you're going to take two or three

426
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:06,120
pinches of this area right around this

427
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,740
fungal you know mushroom this looks like

428
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,779
it could be really interesting so let's

429
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,120
put some of that in there because that

430
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:14,460
could be really beneficial well let's go

431
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,678
over here and take a couple of

432
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,279
teaspoonfuls and go over there and every

433
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,440
time you see variation different plants

434
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,119
different

435
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,700
microorganisms you know most people

436
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,699
don't understand that a mushroom is

437
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,620
individual strands of fungal hyphae the

438
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,440
individual strands you cannot see with

439
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:36,298
your eyes but that mushroom you

440
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,019
definitely will be able to see with your

441
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:41,700
eyes and so you might want to make

442
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,099
certain that you know who the good guy

443
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,919
mushrooms are and take samples from

444
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:48,918
around their

445
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,660
connection with the soil

446
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,640
and leave alone the things the armal

447
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,400
areas the things that could be pathogens

448
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,259
or pests so a little bit of studying up

449
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,259
on what what are the good guys and what

450
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,759
are the bad guys that you can determine

451
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,740
based just on morphology what do they

452
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,980
look like and so you're going to be out

453
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,839
collecting a lot of materials now do you

454
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,940
collect those in the springtime or in

455
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,379
the summer or in the fall the answer to

456
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,600
that is yes

457
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,059
because it's diversity and there'll be

458
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,759
different sets of species that are awake

459
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:23,639
and functioning at different times of

460
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:27,298
the year and you want to get them all

461
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,179
inoculated into your compost

462
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:32,298
then let those organisms grow up that

463
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:36,419
are beneficials we

464
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:40,558
keep our compost piles aerobic because

465
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:42,660
that selects for mostly just the

466
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,660
beneficial microorganisms

467
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:48,360
so the disease causes the problem

468
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,779
organisms they like to be there and the

469
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:54,899
root bound pot because it's perfect with

470
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,418
that low oxygen concentration if we keep

471
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,700
that soil well structured by bacteria

472
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,919
and fungi and protozoan nematodes and

473
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,259
everything else making hallways and

474
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,980
passageways and building condominium

475
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:10,259
housing building large hotels building

476
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,400
large

477
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:16,558
uh structures in the soil so oxygen can

478
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,038
move through very rapidly so water

479
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:22,558
infiltrates and gets held in that soil

480
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:24,839
you never allow leaching to occur

481
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,298
because you need all those nutrients

482
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,399
either in a couple weeks or maybe in

483
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:31,740
another month or maybe next spring

484
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,740
so we want to make sure we're holding on

485
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,319
to all of these things by making sure we

486
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,480
we have a huge diversity of all the

487
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,579
organisms that grow in the springtime

488
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,700
all the organisms that grow in the

489
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:47,460
summer and they're fairly different what

490
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:51,120
is actually growing and functioning

491
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:54,360
but they take over functions

492
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:58,139
that somebody else was doing in the soil

493
00:20:54,359 --> 00:21:01,740
but they did the work better at

494
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,679
you know 15 degrees Fahrenheit or 20

495
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,160
degrees Fahrenheit or you know so as you

496
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,320
go through changes in temperature and

497
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,940
moisture

498
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,918
oxygen concentrations all of those

499
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,320
things you want to make sure you have

500
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,000
the organisms that will be there to do

501
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,220
the jobs for you

502
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,798
so making certain that you're

503
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,380
inoculating

504
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:29,339
indigenous local things it is just

505
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:32,720
laughable to have somebody hand you a

506
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:34,980
jug of bugs and say these are the best

507
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,339
microorganisms we've ever found in the

508
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,519
soil what do you mean by that the who is

509
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:45,720
regarding those five species in there

510
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:49,319
has been the best according to what set

511
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:52,558
of considerations is are they best at

512
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,359
taking up carbon dioxide or the best at

513
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,579
taking up nitrate are they the best at

514
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,839
making ammonium what does your plant

515
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:01,079
need

516
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:03,599
cannabis needs a balance pretty much an

517
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:07,918
equal balance of ammonium

518
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:11,158
and nitrate and so we want an equal

519
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,299
amount of Bio biomass of bacteria as a

520
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,240
fungi

521
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:17,279
and and when we get talking a little bit

522
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,220
later I'll bring up the subject of

523
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,298
succession because that's going to be a

524
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,038
big

525
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,779
um

526
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:27,900
determinant of what you're going to do

527
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:30,298
with different kinds of cannabis to get

528
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,038
the product that you want

529
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:33,298
I have two follow-ups I'm going to ask

530
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:34,980
them at the same time because I have a

531
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:36,480
feeling that you are likely to weave

532
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,400
them together

533
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,140
um the first follow-up is

534
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,240
um we're big fans of having you know

535
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,940
biologically active compost piles here

536
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,700
to pull from for all sorts of reasons

537
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,058
um but I also know that my brethren and

538
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,980
cannabis love to cut corners and so I

539
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:55,918
can very much imagine

540
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,279
um uh cultivators taking the collected

541
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,460
inoculant and instead of putting it into

542
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:05,940
their compost pile instead just putting

543
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,579
it right into their their containers and

544
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,058
so my first part of the question is is

545
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:14,099
there a specific benefit to inoculating

546
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,960
the compost pile first even though the

547
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:19,139
process is going to take longer is there

548
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,360
is there a real extra win for having it

549
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,820
be in the compost pile first and

550
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,379
absolutely and then second after you do

551
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:28,319
the collection but before you do the

552
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,039
inoculation do you recommend just taking

553
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,658
the the collect didn't matter and just

554
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:35,879
you know taking it over to your compost

555
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:40,020
pile and just place it in there or do

556
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,880
you recommend a uh an oxygen incubation

557
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,879
like with an aerated tea to kind of

558
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,480
build up the population first

559
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,360
um we mostly put the organisms directly

560
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,960
into the compost pile because while we

561
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:58,139
want active organisms

562
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,419
we want to constrain the conditions in

563
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,120
that pile so we're selecting for just

564
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,700
the beneficials so you don't ever want

565
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,979
your pile to go anaerobic the instant

566
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,860
you start to smell bad smells coming out

567
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:14,400
of that pile or you know funky kind of

568
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:16,918
you know the ammonia smell the rotten

569
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,100
egg kind of smell mixed together or how

570
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,960
do you describe that but you know by

571
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:23,759
smelling it that something's going

572
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,460
anaerobic in there and that means you

573
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:29,220
have to turn you need to get oxygen in

574
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,919
there if you're too close you know if

575
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,360
you haven't gotten up to 131 degrees

576
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,940
Fahrenheit

577
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,339
for a full three days and you know

578
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,779
you've got to kind of eat along because

579
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:42,418
you really don't want to turn it until

580
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:45,418
you're you've gotten that preventative

581
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,759
kind of medicine for the bad guys are

582
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,980
going to get killed by the heat

583
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,259
um we also want to make sure there's no

584
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,480
anaerobic conditions so what you might

585
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,339
do there where you can this is

586
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,519
smelliness only day two and I've got to

587
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:01,439
wait till day three to turn it

588
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,240
um hasn't been hot enough long enough to

589
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,620
kill the human pathogens plant pathogens

590
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,440
yada yada

591
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:10,079
what you'll do instead is take a like a

592
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,360
PVC pipe or a metal rod

593
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,000
um you know not a lot of thickness to

594
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,859
the hole maker and you're going to take

595
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,159
that and push it down through your

596
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:23,519
compost pile pull it back up because

597
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,340
that's going to leave a hole all the way

598
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:29,339
down to the bottom of your compost pile

599
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:33,778
bring in oxygen back into the system

600
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:37,399
without turning the whole pile when

601
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:42,380
you've gotten to 131 over 131 degrees

602
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:46,440
Fahrenheit or 55 degrees Celsius

603
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:48,960
for three days then you turn with the

604
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,960
Pitchfork and get that all aerated up

605
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,019
and there was a very specific way we

606
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,778
take the hot middle and put it on the

607
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:02,278
bottom of the pile when you start to

608
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:04,919
turn and what was in the cold top part

609
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:06,900
of the pile it goes into the middle

610
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,880
um so that that's the part of the pile

611
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,580
that's gonna have

612
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,940
um killing the disease-causing organisms

613
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:17,099
for for part two and then the bottom

614
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,740
part of the first pile goes on the top

615
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:23,038
and so you always turn in the same

616
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,259
fashion so you know everything in your

617
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,019
pile has been in the hot middle

618
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:31,379
for more than adequate periods of time

619
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:34,319
and if you can't turn because of

620
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,559
temperature considerations you get the

621
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:40,678
PVC pipe or the pipe of the metallic

622
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:44,099
pipe and build yourself some chimneys

623
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,380
how many chimneys it depends on how fast

624
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:48,418
you're getting hot

625
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,240
um and this is where we always have

626
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:54,960
people running into trouble unless they

627
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:58,200
take the foundation classes and learn

628
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,679
how to make good compost we have

629
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:05,700
Hands-On classes that you can take as

630
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,980
well as the um virtual training that you

631
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,000
get in the

632
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:14,819
Foundation courses so if you always want

633
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,880
to learn how to turn you want to go

634
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:22,200
through all of the well why do we look

635
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:25,500
at the recipe for the compost we're

636
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:30,000
selecting for those organisms that are

637
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:33,079
going to best promote the plants that

638
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,919
you're growing in that situation

639
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:39,418
so always uh we we want to you know

640
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,299
always wanna

641
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:44,759
make certain that the compost doesn't

642
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:46,139
have any diseases or pests and and

643
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,079
you've got to go through that step

644
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,700
because there's no other way to kill all

645
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:53,519
of those bad guys especially if you've

646
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,860
got manure of any kind anything that's

647
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,139
been around an animal for a short period

648
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:01,379
of time or a long period of time there's

649
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,380
too many pathogens you cannot be growing

650
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:07,679
something that you know you might be

651
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,799
um lighting up and licking the plant

652
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,860
material surprise it had a disease on it

653
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:16,500
not good so we want to take care of that

654
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:19,319
problem before we ever put it out on our

655
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,359
property building compost is one of

656
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,579
those things that um you know my dad my

657
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,379
dad always said uh it's you know learn

658
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:28,319
from your mistakes but if you can learn

659
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,900
from someone else's mistakes and um I I

660
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,480
I'm a big proponent of of people

661
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,880
actually taking formal compost classes

662
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,038
because you know a lot of it a lot of

663
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:42,480
the activity we can't see a lot of it is

664
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:46,319
not intuitive and and you can destroy

665
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,000
your own work in simple ways and so it's

666
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,538
it really is something to to actually

667
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,319
take a class and the road to hell is uh

668
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:57,679
you know with my good intentions yeah

669
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,960
paid by Good Intentions yeah

670
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,480
so when I first began studying the soil

671
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,759
food web uh after hearing you speak um

672
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,038
you know I definitely got the impact of

673
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,558
you know the model of understanding

674
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,940
right away and I started applying it and

675
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,399
then you know encouraging it in others

676
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:18,120
but then my mind was blown away a second

677
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,220
time coming across folks talking about

678
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,139
um the water food web and it's

679
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,778
interesting because in your brain it's

680
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,640
kind of like the same basic model but

681
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:29,398
these were water loving creatures

682
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,200
instead of soil loving creatures and

683
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:33,119
then and then some biology probably

684
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,100
loves both

685
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,259
um so it would I mean I assume it would

686
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:39,000
be a fallacy to treat them separately so

687
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,339
what I'd like to know is how do you

688
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,398
think about the relationship between the

689
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:48,418
water food web and the soil food web and

690
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:50,759
and the you know how they may overlap

691
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:53,399
um because you still want the same

692
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:56,700
nutrient cycling the you're gonna have

693
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:58,798
root systems down into the water and and

694
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,380
I don't know why people always think

695
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:05,339
that well if your roots hit the water

696
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:09,299
you get to the water table like your

697
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:12,778
roots can't go through the water well

698
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:15,720
why not what do we keep pouring on our

699
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:19,460
plants in order to get them to grow yeah

700
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:23,759
it's water so what's so terribly long

701
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:26,159
wrong about water

702
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,079
as long as you keep it aerobic there is

703
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,820
no problem and the root systems of your

704
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:33,000
plants will go right down through

705
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:35,339
whatever water is present get down into

706
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,200
the sediments and then the root systems

707
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:39,898
go into the sediments and the sediments

708
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,080
are just like your soil at a slightly

709
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:46,139
higher percent moisture so

710
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:49,678
you have to select for things that can

711
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,799
deal with that high water content and

712
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,659
there will be some species that you only

713
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,220
find in

714
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:59,700
um you know like when you're growing

715
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:04,798
rice a huge component while that field

716
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:07,140
is is underwater you will have quite a

717
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:10,519
bit different sets of microorganisms

718
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,320
present as you dry that surface out

719
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,720
those

720
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:18,778
microorganisms that require more than 50

721
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,419
moisture more than 75 percent moisture

722
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:25,619
they will all go to sleep they form

723
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:27,179
spores they will be present next year so

724
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,479
how do we get all the right sets of

725
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:33,240
microorganisms back into the soil in a

726
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,360
water system well we're gonna make

727
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,339
compost where we're going to have a

728
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,038
pretty

729
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:43,019
wet and soppy most of the time so you

730
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,599
can do exactly what we do with

731
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:51,658
terrestrial systems you can be doing

732
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:54,178
with plants that are more aquatic so

733
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:57,720
yeah you know you just have to recognize

734
00:31:54,179 --> 00:32:01,080
the needs of your plant what does your

735
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:04,440
plant do best does it like it with the

736
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:06,960
moisture fairly low moisture kind of

737
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,000
medium or fairly you know we're going

738
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,720
into the pond here

739
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,599
um

740
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,220
and you're going to have to do some of

741
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:19,099
that testing probably yourself because

742
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:22,079
it's not something that in the world of

743
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:24,898
understanding landscapes we haven't

744
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,778
really paid enough attention to this

745
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:30,658
water Factor how much water is normal

746
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:32,460
well it's normal to be at this level in

747
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:35,159
the springtime and then it dries down a

748
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,880
bit and then it's completely dry and

749
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,980
just before Harvest which makes things

750
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,179
harvesting much easier

751
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,700
so

752
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:47,399
um yeah pay attention it sounds like

753
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,580
it's another argument for being sure to

754
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:52,319
collect uh you know local indigenous

755
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:54,898
microbes too because if you are

756
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:59,278
collecting from many different uh

757
00:32:54,898 --> 00:33:01,259
locations on your parcel and and you are

758
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,000
building them into your compost pile at

759
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:04,619
different times of year it means that

760
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,440
you're collecting them for example where

761
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:10,739
I live it rains for a vast part of the

762
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,759
year but my my growing season we turn to

763
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,798
drought and so if I want my soil to you

764
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,379
know come into the drought season

765
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,720
already being healthy and then be able

766
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,720
to make the transition to a drier

767
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,600
environment that seems to suggest that I

768
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,179
would want year-round

769
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:33,240
microorganisms collected so that my soil

770
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:35,640
is you know jam-packed full of of

771
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,339
flexible microorganisms that can that

772
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,500
can play that on off around the around

773
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:42,058
the calendar where these folks go to

774
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,619
sleep when these wake up and then these

775
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:45,960
other ones go to sleep in the other one

776
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,699
and so we have this this gentle seasonal

777
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,200
back and forth

778
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,538
and and it's all part of the

779
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,519
biodiversity we have to establish right

780
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:55,980
from the very beginning

781
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,558
one of my favorite um things and and I

782
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,120
and I'm probably gonna paraphrase you

783
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:01,980
poorly so I apologize for that but one

784
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,719
of the things that I found very

785
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,120
um inspiring when I first heard you

786
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,220
speak was you were talking about the the

787
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,500
beginning of the soil

788
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:13,319
um as like this this threshold point

789
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,719
between the sky and the Earth and it all

790
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,119
comes like right down there to where we

791
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,638
stand and it really kind of shifted my

792
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,379
perspective for how big these two halves

793
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,599
are if you will

794
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:27,480
um I'd like to focus on

795
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,679
um an inch and a half of the soil food

796
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,260
web

797
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,139
um that that inch and a half right above

798
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:37,020
the soil so so many cultivators choose

799
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,300
to grow tiny you know one to three inch

800
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:42,119
companion plants with like a a single

801
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:45,179
leaf or two leaves to create a a short

802
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,579
dense canopy over the soil surrounding

803
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,980
the cannabis plant we talk about using

804
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:52,019
dichondra pens a lot here on shaping the

805
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:56,219
fire is an example of that the the

806
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:59,338
multitude of roots and the root exudates

807
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:02,219
make for a rich and dynamic rhizosphere

808
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:03,779
all those downward Pathways of all those

809
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:06,000
little plants you know create a place

810
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,519
for the water to seep through so that we

811
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,440
can avoid becoming hydrophobic and you

812
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:12,358
know all that all that exudate you know

813
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,880
conversation is is pro is really great

814
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:16,980
too my question for you is this what

815
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,880
sort of Life happens in that little

816
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:22,199
space between the canopy you know you

817
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,140
know an inch and a half two or three

818
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,598
inches above the soil and and the soil

819
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:30,059
that that inch and a half of Bio region

820
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,280
there's moisture held in there

821
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:34,199
um like who's living there and and what

822
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,180
what biological processes are happening

823
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:39,239
in that in that small area

824
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:41,219
and I would really encourage you to

825
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:44,578
start looking at some of your soils

826
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:47,459
digging down and trying to find out

827
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:50,400
where these different layers are when

828
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,039
you're in a old growth forest because

829
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,980
you don't really have well especially if

830
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,199
it's not a very healthy Forest you don't

831
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,440
have anything that's going to mix that

832
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:04,199
organic matter layer down into the soil

833
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,280
and it's very harmful for most of our

834
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:10,799
plants to not have some kind of mixing

835
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,300
movement and that's again where the

836
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,880
microorganisms are going to come into

837
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,359
play because they're going to be moving

838
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,880
that organic matter as it's decomposing

839
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:22,559
and getting into smaller and smaller

840
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,079
bits there you're going to have

841
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,639
microorganisms taking that away to build

842
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,780
structure with

843
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:34,618
and so it's not the top one to

844
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,200
um one to one point five depth you want

845
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:40,019
to see that organ

846
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:43,259
organic material sorry organic material

847
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:46,259
moving down into the soil so that

848
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:49,980
um o horizon or the intermediate between

849
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:53,339
the organic layer and the first layer of

850
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,740
true soil where you've got Sandstone

851
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:58,259
clay present as well as the organic

852
00:36:55,739 --> 00:37:00,959
matter you want the root system growing

853
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,060
down through all of that you don't stop

854
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,099
if you're a root you don't stop there

855
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:07,019
either so the root systems are going to

856
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:10,740
keep on growing if your roots are

857
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:11,579
stopping at 1.5

858
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:15,539
um

859
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:18,240
inches or you know centimeters into the

860
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:21,539
soil you've got compaction

861
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:24,419
which is deadly when it comes to growing

862
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:27,420
plants that are going to have all of the

863
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,559
uh you know genetic characteristics that

864
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:34,519
we want good flavor strong stem

865
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:36,659
resistant to diseases and pests

866
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:40,380
you've got to have

867
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:42,659
normal soil where those root systems are

868
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,300
going to keep growing straight down they

869
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:48,559
don't usually stop if they're healthy

870
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:52,200
they don't stop at one and a half inches

871
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:55,320
so the roots themselves will be a part

872
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:58,139
of this contingent of moving materials

873
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,559
from that organic matter layer down

874
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:03,299
deeper and deeper into the soil water

875
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:05,759
moving along taking the smaller

876
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:09,240
particles down with it so that you get

877
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,980
you develop a really good a horizon

878
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:15,239
and of course if you've got a really

879
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:17,940
good a horizon then as you go deeper and

880
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:20,578
uh you know All the Small Things stay up

881
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:23,579
there at the surface of the soil the

882
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,380
bigger chunks move down deeper into the

883
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:27,960
soil B Horizon

884
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:32,880
and then as you get deeper and lower

885
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:37,079
than that mixture it's sea Horizon which

886
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:40,380
most soils people look at as being

887
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,060
sterile which it absolutely is not

888
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,280
sterile

889
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:47,460
how far down to the organisms in your

890
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,619
soil go you know how far down do we see

891
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,780
these bacteria fungi protozoan nematodes

892
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,039
microarthropods earthworms Inca trades

893
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,079
everything else

894
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,079
so 12 miles

895
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,820
oh that's how deep the soil really is

896
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,640
now your roots aren't going to be

897
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:05,579
getting down there but all these really

898
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:10,679
important factors are going on in all of

899
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:12,320
that 12 miles of soil that you've got

900
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:16,500
below

901
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,019
the interface with plants so if plant

902
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,239
roots how far if you're looking at a

903
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:24,059
Douglas fir how far down into the soil

904
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:28,078
can the roots go

905
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:30,059
as tall as a tree is above the surface

906
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,680
of the soil

907
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:35,820
So Below

908
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:38,338
so if you're Douglas fir is 200 feet

909
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:42,240
tall the root system of the plant is

910
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:45,779
going to be about 200 feet down

911
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:48,479
so it's a great interface between the

912
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:51,720
atmosphere and what it's doing and

913
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,300
what's going on in the soil and the soil

914
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:57,838
below that

915
00:39:53,300 --> 00:40:00,480
so lots of things I could go off on a

916
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,460
go off on but um yeah I think that's

917
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,440
probably complex enough

918
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,559
um if our Focus

919
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,480
um in for this aspect uh is to make sure

920
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:12,000
that the

921
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:16,019
um the organic material that is

922
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,920
decomposing on the top of the soil uh is

923
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:23,759
finding its way down into the soil to be

924
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,940
moved around by the super highways

925
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,940
um is this a a is this a good case for

926
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,039
why we would have a

927
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,659
um you know a companion plant on top you

928
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,338
know many people use the term cover crop

929
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:38,460
even though that's not exactly accurate

930
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:40,980
for us but but this if we grow these

931
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:45,838
small plants as companion plants and

932
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:48,599
they create a a one or a two Leaf canopy

933
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:52,320
um you know two inches above the soil it

934
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,359
creates this Zone where I imagine that

935
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,940
there is going to be a lot of biological

936
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:58,559
life because it's um there's moisture

937
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,559
there and it's protected some from

938
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,239
direct sun and what I imagine is that

939
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,179
there are lots of organisms that are

940
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:09,299
processing you know the the healthy

941
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:10,440
compost that I've put on top or or

942
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,300
um you know anything I've collected

943
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,838
around the area anything that we put on

944
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:20,039
top the way it gets into the soil would

945
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,820
be uh improved if I have this this you

946
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,119
know

947
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:26,820
canopy that creates this you know two

948
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,960
inch area above the soil but below the

949
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:33,740
canopy where there can be active biology

950
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,480
when you hear that does that sound like

951
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:38,639
nature or or is that just something that

952
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,539
I think sounds great

953
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:44,279
um you've got got it almost right and

954
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:49,079
probably what you're not considering

955
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,920
here again is the comp compaction

956
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,039
um

957
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,039
you need to have those understory plants

958
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:59,400
or you know you know grow that grow out

959
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:02,338
and they may only be a you know an inch

960
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,780
tall two inches tall depends on what

961
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:09,779
your crop plant is how tall your cover

962
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,400
plants are going to be the ground cover

963
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,640
is another that's the word I was looking

964
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,160
for a minute ago the ground cover

965
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,980
and you don't want just one species you

966
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:22,500
don't want just two because who's going

967
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,480
to survive next spring we we don't we

968
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,880
can't tell you what the weather's going

969
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,980
to be what it's going to be like so we

970
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,260
want to maximize diversity right there

971
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,760
keep some of the things that cause

972
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:38,700
maximum diversity to stay in your system

973
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,839
from now until forever as far as you're

974
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:43,078
concerned

975
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:46,259
we want to have prevent water drops

976
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:48,000
falling from the sky to directly impact

977
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,760
on the surface of your soil because

978
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,338
you're compacting all of those Airways

979
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,420
and passageways when that drop hits the

980
00:42:53,338 --> 00:43:00,119
surface of the soil wow it's the major

981
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:02,760
compacting problem that we have in

982
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,740
agricultural systems yeah it's bad

983
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,280
enough driving over your soil with a big

984
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:11,338
machinery but big machinery can be

985
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,859
constrained to just to wheel rows

986
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,420
rainfall how are you going to get it to

987
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:17,699
fall in just one place

988
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,460
and imagine the damage that would be

989
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:22,618
done if it fell in just one place I

990
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,019
never considered rain as a as a

991
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:26,579
compaction action and but it totally

992
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,920
makes sense and and now I understand

993
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,079
better what you said earlier about the

994
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,059
depth of the roots where where these

995
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,760
these short plants might be nice because

996
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:37,799
they grow into like this this blanket

997
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,859
that protects it from compaction from

998
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,839
the rain but but now I understand better

999
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:45,119
that you're also saying make sure you

1000
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:49,078
have a variety of plants

1001
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,660
um that are going to have a deeper Roots

1002
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:53,640
um like you know radishes or something

1003
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:56,219
um so that so that you've got a variety

1004
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:58,879
of root depths and a variety of exudate

1005
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:02,338
conversation that's taking place exactly

1006
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,880
and really when you start looking at

1007
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:09,559
um how is it that having plants growing

1008
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,358
on that surface short low growing plants

1009
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,519
they're continuing to have nutrient

1010
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,799
cycling going on all of the time so if

1011
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:19,380
your plant ever you know suffers some

1012
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,818
harm the nutrient cycling is still going

1013
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,858
to be there they're still going to be

1014
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:24,960
hooked up to the the low ground system

1015
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:27,358
of mycorrhizal fungi

1016
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,720
because everything in this Orchard

1017
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:33,059
everything in your cannabis plot should

1018
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,980
be connected below ground ex you know

1019
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:37,799
maybe not some of the kales in the coal

1020
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:41,699
and the those early successional plots

1021
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,740
the weeds those plants won't have the

1022
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:47,399
mycorrhizal connection but as soon as

1023
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:50,818
you get past that where we're looking at

1024
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:54,059
um fungal bacterial biomass ratio of

1025
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:57,119
upwards around 0.5 or greater they're

1026
00:44:54,059 --> 00:45:01,139
all mycorrhizal and so everything's tied

1027
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:04,318
together we want the surface protected

1028
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:07,259
by the leaf material because when that

1029
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:11,219
drop of water impacts on a leaf

1030
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,680
it pushes that leaf down and the water

1031
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:16,139
gently

1032
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:17,578
rolls off that leaf surface and ends up

1033
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:20,159
in your soil

1034
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:23,039
so we've completely taken care of that

1035
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,259
compacting effect and some of those

1036
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,599
nutrients are moving with that drop of

1037
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,000
water into your soil

1038
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,980
so there's lots of benefits and lots of

1039
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,159
ways that you've got this continuous

1040
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:37,639
cover usually these

1041
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:41,460
um Ground Covers

1042
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:43,440
wake up and start growing earlier than

1043
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,920
your crop plant you know think about

1044
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:51,240
when do you transplant your cannabis

1045
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:54,300
into the ground outside well it it's not

1046
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:56,459
the day after the soil is no longer free

1047
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:00,500
Frozen because most of the time none of

1048
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:03,119
us pay attention to how cold is the soil

1049
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,980
it's how nasty is it going to be when I

1050
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,838
have to be out there doing all this work

1051
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:10,500
and so it's going to be a month later

1052
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:14,039
and so you think of all that time where

1053
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:16,500
those understory plants are getting the

1054
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:18,659
soil ready for whatever crop you're

1055
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,119
going to be putting in it's a little bit

1056
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:26,039
of you know we you need to understand

1057
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:28,740
what your particular crop requires in

1058
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:32,759
terms of fungal bacterial biomass ratio

1059
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:34,799
you need to have that time to build the

1060
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,160
fungal biomass if you're lacking in

1061
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:42,240
fungi or build the protozoan populations

1062
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:45,299
and the good guy nematodes so that

1063
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:47,279
you've got maximum nutrient cycling all

1064
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,400
of the things are being held and stored

1065
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:54,300
and moved and built just exactly the way

1066
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,619
they should so we want nice cover not

1067
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,818
just here and there

1068
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:04,260
we want the best places where I'm seeing

1069
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:07,500
the best coverage is where they have 20

1070
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:10,560
different species of seeds that have

1071
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:14,219
been spread and you can see where this

1072
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,500
summer upcomes these five species of

1073
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:19,318
ground cover but really you don't see

1074
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,960
much of the other ones but next year

1075
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:24,779
it's like none of the five that were

1076
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,519
really important last year they're not

1077
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,400
even you know peeping their heads above

1078
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:31,980
because things just are not right for

1079
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,318
them when so you want to have something

1080
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:37,440
that's going to go yay this is perfect

1081
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:39,539
for me and so you'll give five or six

1082
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,099
different species showing their heads

1083
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:43,318
and then there's always those years

1084
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:47,940
where everything grows and it's

1085
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:49,920
spectacular when you look in your uh you

1086
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,380
know in your garden is really what it

1087
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,500
looks like because you've got the rose

1088
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:57,780
of the plant you're trying to grow for

1089
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:01,260
profit and you've got all these

1090
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:05,579
understory plants that are just peaking

1091
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:09,180
through the blades of uh and showing

1092
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:10,740
their heads so that the the flowers are

1093
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:13,919
beautiful

1094
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:16,078
so lots of things to sit back and

1095
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,420
understand and we're still trying to

1096
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,760
figure out some of a lot of these things

1097
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,559
you know is we

1098
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,780
it's always interesting to try to figure

1099
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,259
out where does all this nitrogen come

1100
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:31,560
from we have a bumper crop amount of

1101
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:36,319
nitrogen in our soil but if you go and

1102
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:41,279
try to analyze you know soluble nitrogen

1103
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:43,619
total nitrogen exchangeable nitrogen

1104
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,780
there's a missing part of the nitrogen

1105
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:47,818
cycle that we're not paying any

1106
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,099
attention to at all

1107
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:51,838
and so you know people always do

1108
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:57,599
calculations of well you couldn't

1109
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:58,578
possibly keep these uh you know 40 440

1110
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,960
000

1111
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:03,660
individual plants You couldn't possibly

1112
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,240
keep them alive and happy with really

1113
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:09,299
high levels of nitrogen in them if you

1114
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:11,519
don't use inorganic fertilizer and yet

1115
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,380
all of our plants have much higher

1116
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,960
levels of nitrogen

1117
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:19,200
than the chemically grown

1118
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,358
plants so you know which one's going to

1119
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:24,838
give you better flavor which one is

1120
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:27,000
going to give you more nutrition which

1121
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:30,299
ones are going to taste better

1122
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,280
so there's some of this this work that

1123
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:35,640
we've still got a

1124
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:38,160
Mother Nature is not yet revealed all to

1125
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:41,098
us we've got some more work to do you

1126
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:44,039
know what what a great time to be a uh a

1127
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:47,460
young scientist coming up into the the

1128
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:51,480
system where you know you've broken the

1129
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:54,420
idea of you know the the soil food web

1130
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,880
and that even though it seems obvious

1131
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:59,099
now you know that the soil is alive but

1132
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,619
now we also have got the analytical

1133
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:03,900
Technologies to take measurements and

1134
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:05,640
and see what we're working with it's a

1135
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,180
it's a great time to be coming into

1136
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:10,500
thinking about regenerative growing

1137
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:12,299
indeed so we're going to take a short

1138
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,159
we're going to take a short break and be

1139
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,560
right back you're listening to shaping

1140
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,539
fire and my guest today is Dr Elaine

1141
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,279
Ingham uh without these advertisers

1142
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:22,318
shaping fire wouldn't happen so please

1143
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,930
support them and let them know you heard

1144
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,279
them on shaping fire

1145
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:27,960
[Music]

1146
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,700
one of the challenges with buying

1147
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,559
Autoflower seeds is that often you'll

1148
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:33,960
have as many different phenos as you

1149
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,779
will have seeds in a pack that can be

1150
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:39,119
fun sure but so many varieties in one

1151
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,160
pack is a sign of an immature seed line

1152
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,440
that hasn't been worked enough

1153
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:45,358
I prefer my autoflowers to be worked

1154
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,159
enough that each Fino in the pack really

1155
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,539
captures the aspects that the breeder

1156
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:51,358
was intending

1157
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:52,980

painstakingly sifted again and again

1163
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:06,420
tested in a wide range of conditions and

1164
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:09,179
taken to a level of maturity that each

1165
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,519

listening to shaping fire I'm your host

00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:57,240
Shango Lowe's and my guest today is Dr

1295
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:59,338
Elaine Ingham so before the break we

1296
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:02,459
were talking a lot about the importance

1297
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:05,759
of of encouraging and supporting the

1298
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:07,679
soil food web and making sure all of the

1299
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,839
different plants in your garden are

1300
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:12,299
talking with each other because indeed

1301
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,519
we are looking to support a web of

1302
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,380
communication and transference of

1303
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,838
nutrition and things like that

1304
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:21,480
so Dr Elaine you know many cultivators

1305
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:23,699
aspire to the soil food web ideals but

1306
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,099
they they still get hung up on keeping

1307
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:27,480
sterile growing environments like even

1308
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:30,359
outside

1309
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:33,780
um instead of focusing on biology and

1310
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:36,179
balance they intend instead for like

1311
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:39,359
ideals like like zero pest present like

1312
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:42,239
there's not a single pest in my garden

1313
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:44,818
um how do you teach the mindset of the

1314
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:47,479
soil food web so that your students

1315
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:51,659
understand this the softer idea of

1316
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:54,599
biological inclusion in Balance instead

1317
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:57,420
of the absolutist ideals of zero

1318
00:56:54,599 --> 00:57:00,960
tolerance for anybody who isn't on my

1319
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:03,000
team yeah it's because it's what we were

1320
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,000
all taught when we were in grade school

1321
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,519
and middle school and so on certainly in

1322
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,380
any microbiology class you know what's

1323
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:15,059
the most dangerous thing you're going to

1324
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:17,460
encounter today the door handle on the

1325
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:21,119
room because everybody touches it going

1326
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,980
in and out and not really it's not like

1327
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,220
that's a special place for

1328
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,960
disease-causing organisms to grow

1329
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:29,939
you're just inoculating a lot of really

1330
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,760
interesting things on that door handle

1331
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:34,440
but you're also inoculating all of the

1332
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,319
beneficials

1333
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,240
so there's a balance there that you've

1334
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:42,659
got to think if you've got people with

1335
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:44,279
good decent they've picked up their

1336
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:47,879
apple every day or they've picked up

1337
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:50,880
some really good soil smelled it they

1338
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:52,500
were working in their compost pile you

1339
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,260
don't have to worry about the nor the

1340
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:59,639
doorknob anymore every morning go out

1341
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:02,880
there and wipe all of your door knobs

1342
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:05,400
with a really good handful of compost

1343
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,858
that you know has got all of the really

1344
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,460
beneficial organisms in it

1345
00:58:07,858 --> 00:58:13,139
um

1346
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:16,559
one of the mechanisms for why this is

1347
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:19,940
important is that if you've got a

1348
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:22,920
sterile system there's nothing to stop

1349
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:26,579
the disease-causing organisms if

1350
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:30,858
perchance they get inoculated and so

1351
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:34,440
runs through your Greenhouse all of the

1352
00:58:30,858 --> 00:58:37,259
containers all of the benches below the

1353
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,818
benches all the little spiders and all

1354
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:42,540
the cute little

1355
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:44,699
um uh Buzzy little flies that drive us

1356
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:46,920
all crazy where did all of these aphids

1357
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:49,139
come from where did these white flies

1358
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,480
come from well it's probably became

1359
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:54,779
because you're being too sterile about

1360
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,780
things you're not letting there be those

1361
00:58:54,780 --> 00:59:00,480
things that would wipe out

1362
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,519
those diseases and pests before they

1363
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,559
ever got to a high enough concentration

1364
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:05,940
that it would start bothering us as

1365
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,900
human beings

1366
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:12,000
so whenever we're looking to get rid of

1367
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,940
a disease-causing organism especially in

1368
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,699
a greenhouse is go in and look and see

1369
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:19,619
where might the spores be hanging out

1370
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:23,159
and they're going to have a specific

1371
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:26,119
part of the greenhouse or if you're

1372
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:31,019
outside specific part of the soil

1373
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:34,079
typically low oxygen lots of dead bodies

1374
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:35,639
of things and things for them to you

1375
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:39,660
know Chow Down On

1376
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:42,058
so those eggs were or spores when they

1377
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:44,159
hatch have all the food they need right

1378
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:47,220
around them so they can very quickly

1379
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:50,519
move into the next stage of their life

1380
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:56,058
where those larval stages are moving off

1381
00:59:50,519 --> 01:00:00,059
someplace else and they need the unclean

1382
00:59:56,059 --> 01:00:02,940
ecosystems in order to thrive and have

1383
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:06,240
each one of those larvae make it through

1384
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:08,818
to adulthood and then you know the mom

1385
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:11,879
and dad they're flying around they're

1386
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:14,759
they're every place they touch is going

1387
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:18,119
to be a mass of these disease-causing

1388
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,859
organisms going out on the surfaces of

1389
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:22,318
the above ground parts of your plants

1390
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:24,298
and the crown of your plants quite often

1391
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:26,639
I'm sure some of you have noticed that

1392
01:00:24,298 --> 01:00:29,280
some of the larvae hang out right there

1393
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,659
at the crown of the plant that's their

1394
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,019
favorite place and they're slowly

1395
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:35,460
munching through and killing parts of

1396
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:37,739
the root system

1397
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:41,519
which now are gonna of course be

1398
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:45,838
anaerobic and chock full of diseases

1399
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:48,420
so sterility is not a good idea

1400
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:51,838
when we're trying to prevent

1401
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:56,039
you know exactly why we were spraying

1402
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:58,920
horrible toxic chemicals all through the

1403
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:01,259
um through all through the greenhouse

1404
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,358
so we want to have all of these

1405
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:07,099
beneficial organisms in there so that

1406
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:09,659
when that disease causing organism is

1407
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:11,940
accidentally brought into your

1408
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:13,379
greenhouse and somebody leaves the

1409
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:15,240
handprint

1410
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,980
we want to have those beneficial

1411
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:19,919
organisms that look at those

1412
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:23,818
disease-causing organisms and go we had

1413
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:25,680
somebody brought lunch and they Chow

1414
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:28,679
Down and take them all out there's a

1415
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:32,058
direct conflict in many cases

1416
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:33,739
with those kinds of organisms and the

1417
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:37,019
beneficials

1418
01:01:33,739 --> 01:01:40,318
regard the disease causers as just a

1419
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:42,420
source of food you want those kinds of

1420
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:45,058
beneficial organisms in your system so

1421
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:48,720
sterile not a good idea because you

1422
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:50,160
can't keep human beings sterile

1423
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:52,739
um and they're probably the biggest

1424
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:54,838
problem in spreading diseases throughout

1425
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:57,479
a greenhouse and in places that you'd

1426
01:01:54,838 --> 01:02:00,659
never think about you know like when

1427
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:04,679
people are standing at the table and

1428
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:07,920
they're transplanting this plant from A

1429
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:10,019
to B and they take all the dead leaf

1430
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,720
Material off they maybe see some dead

1431
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:15,960
roots and they pull that off what are

1432
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:17,818
they doing with that plant material they

1433
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,039
drop it on the floor next to them right

1434
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:22,920
and now you've set up a perfect

1435
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:25,279
environment for all of the white flies

1436
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:28,440
and the

1437
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,760
microarthropods the little tiny flying

1438
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,338
Critters

1439
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,799
perfect place for them to lay their eggs

1440
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:37,858
and for the larvae to hatch out

1441
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:40,380
and go through that whole stage right

1442
01:02:37,858 --> 01:02:41,940
there in the gravel

1443
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,740
under your feet

1444
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:47,159
and people don't think about they've got

1445
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:51,479
to clean that too so what's the best way

1446
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:53,940
of cleaning that floor material apply

1447
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:56,519
some compost tea apply some compost

1448
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,500
extract that's got the organisms that

1449
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,019
are going to take care of all of those

1450
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:04,440
disease causers yeah I have to keep it

1451
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:08,099
aerobic enough so don't over water

1452
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,838
but um as certainly when you look at

1453
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:13,980
what triggers

1454
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:16,380
the plants immune system its resistance

1455
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:20,219
to diseases and pests

1456
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:23,640
it's those microorganisms that will

1457
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:26,219
trigger they'll send out to the plan the

1458
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:29,639
information that there's something bad

1459
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:30,779
happen in here the hordes of I don't

1460
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:33,598
know what should we call them purple

1461
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,200
devils are coming at us

1462
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,480
um

1463
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:39,118
they need help from the plant and the

1464
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,059
plant needs to contribute something to

1465
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:45,059
the upkeep of those bacteria fungi

1466
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:47,220
protozoan nematodes that will attack and

1467
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:50,040
consume the diseases in the past

1468
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:53,279
I can almost hear the the greenhouse

1469
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:55,980
managers listening to this in a being

1470
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:58,380
aghast because you know their normal

1471
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:00,480
mindset is probably to

1472
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:03,180
um you know spray or clean their floors

1473
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,579
uh with either some kind of you know

1474
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:06,838
chemical sterilizer or you know a ten to

1475
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:09,059
one bleach you know depending on the

1476
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:10,500
variety of floor they have and now

1477
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:12,119
instead

1478
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,798
um you know we're talking about no spray

1479
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:16,019
them with compost tea because we want

1480
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:17,699
the entire environment to be tied

1481
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:20,460
together

1482
01:04:17,699 --> 01:04:23,578
um biologically so that it's prepared

1483
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:25,559
for any Invaders and it makes total

1484
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:28,680
sense when you say it but you know it's

1485
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:30,359
it's also heresy from you know the way

1486
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,980
things have been done in the past

1487
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:34,818
yeah because we didn't you're no

1488
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:37,559
stranger the heresy though

1489
01:04:34,818 --> 01:04:40,079
what have I done all my life

1490
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:41,880
um you know because I'm I'm mostly

1491
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,000
interested in the truth and I want to

1492
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:48,480
understand why things work and when

1493
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,659
we've had uh you know systems that

1494
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:54,000
depend on pulling the wool over people's

1495
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:56,399
faces and because that's what the

1496
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,039
chemical industry is they've been

1497
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,338
convincing us to put out terribly toxic

1498
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,858
things to kill particular sets of

1499
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:06,239
microorganisms who then just develop

1500
01:05:04,858 --> 01:05:09,659
resistance

1501
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:11,279
to those chemical applications so now

1502
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:13,679
how are you gonna how are you going to

1503
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,480
deal with these problems the only way is

1504
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,879
biologically we've got to get the

1505
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,639
beneficials back out there we've got to

1506
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,440
keep it aerobic yep so that's a biggie

1507
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,098
we want to make certain that we've got

1508
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:28,679
Critters that eat those organisms and we

1509
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:31,380
want those things that will inhibit

1510
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:35,940
we are definitely with toxic chemicals

1511
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:39,720
but it doesn't leave the area around the

1512
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:42,960
bacterium or around the roots or the

1513
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:46,139
hyphy of the plants they don't just you

1514
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:49,980
know mindlessly go out and apply massive

1515
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:51,838
amounts of toxic chemicals far beyond

1516
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:54,659
what you actually need

1517
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:56,759
so let's give these organisms a chance

1518
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:59,338
to show you what they can do

1519
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:02,819
where you will become accustomed

1520
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:05,338
hopefully all of our children will read

1521
01:06:02,818 --> 01:06:07,920
stories about this time in life in in

1522
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:12,119
the history of man and go how could

1523
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:15,920
these people have been so blind

1524
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:19,380
power of the written word isn't it

1525
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,519
it's amazing how much of that is um I

1526
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:24,298
mean sure we need to learn best

1527
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:26,639
practices uh for using nature to support

1528
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:29,280
nature instead of chemicals to keep

1529
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:31,078
nature at Bay but but like outside of

1530
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,059
the best practices so much of it is just

1531
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:35,220
trust too because I you know I was

1532
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:37,680
brought up to trust chemicals and

1533
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:40,739
pharmaceuticals for that matter and and

1534
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:42,779
you know as we realized that that was a

1535
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:45,179
you know philosophy that that over time

1536
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:47,339
was bunk now we need to kind of like

1537
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:50,098
untrain ourselves back towards

1538
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:51,779
regenerative which which you know for

1539
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:53,640
the most part is you know what we what

1540
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,859
we try to do here

1541
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:58,379
um I've got another question about like

1542
01:06:55,858 --> 01:07:00,900
you know the the pest populations that's

1543
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:02,940
kind of a corollary to this more and

1544
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:05,880
more folks in cannabis are learning to

1545
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:07,500
effectively use beneficial insects and

1546
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,539
trust them more just like we were

1547
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:11,818
talking about when I think about

1548
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:15,240
beneficial beneficial insects through

1549
01:07:11,818 --> 01:07:17,639
the the lens of the soil food web I kind

1550
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:20,519
of Imagine That dumping thousands of

1551
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:24,118
beneficial predators of any variety into

1552
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:29,280
a cultivation area might throw off the

1553
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:30,780
balance of the the local soil food web

1554
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,460
um certainly you know Target pest

1555
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,619
populations will be reduced right

1556
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:37,139
whatever it is they eat but are there

1557
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:39,900
are there any other potential soil food

1558
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:43,259
impacts that we should be aware of when

1559
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:48,480
using beneficial insects because we we

1560
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:51,119
are super packing a particular niche of

1561
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,420
the soil food web with suddenly a lot of

1562
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,858
participants and I like the idea that

1563
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:58,380
it's just gonna they're just going to

1564
01:07:55,858 --> 01:08:00,900
eat the target pests and then eventually

1565
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:03,019
go off to find new food sources but I

1566
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:06,298
don't actually know that to be true

1567
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:11,099
and it's essentially true but it's like

1568
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:13,798
when you put a huge amount of

1569
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:16,798
um a predator into the system it's going

1570
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:20,759
to go looking for prey and it will drop

1571
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:22,979
the um species and what if those

1572
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:26,279
um things that just got eaten by the

1573
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:28,979
beneficial insects what if they were

1574
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:31,440
what prevents some other disease from

1575
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:34,259
attacking the root system of your plant

1576
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:37,198
and so you're you homed right in on

1577
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:40,198
exactly what the problem is it's a

1578
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:42,659
density problem you you've got to spread

1579
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:45,419
those beneficial insects out throughout

1580
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:47,759
your whole bed you can't be applying

1581
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:49,259
them all everything goes into the soil

1582
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:51,179
down here and we assume they're going to

1583
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:54,140
spread all the way down the end of your

1584
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:58,020
bed or your agricultural field

1585
01:08:54,140 --> 01:09:00,960
you want to be putting a few in every

1586
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:03,380
places you're going down the line just a

1587
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,279
few because it takes a lot of

1588
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:08,640
microorganisms a lot of the smaller

1589
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:09,239
Critters to satisfy the

1590
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,440
um

1591
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:15,599
the hunger of the Predator that you just

1592
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:17,460
dropped into the system and they were

1593
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,279
already competing with each other when

1594
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:22,380
in whatever container you were keeping

1595
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:25,560
them and now they're you've let them

1596
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:28,319
loose and they just go crazy

1597
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:31,319
um and not the beneficial

1598
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,660
prey group down to almost nothing

1599
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:36,960
so now you're looking for potential

1600
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:38,818
diseases we need to and so here's

1601
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,239
something that we haven't quite gotten

1602
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:44,580
around to we need to have our microscope

1603
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:46,738
look at it and go

1604
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:50,399
um here's the problem organism coming on

1605
01:09:46,738 --> 01:09:53,099
and so I need more of

1606
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:56,279
um you know these bacteria I need more

1607
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:59,699
of these fungi if I'm going to put in

1608
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:01,738
more of these beneficial insects

1609
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:03,960
they're going to be eating my bacterium

1610
01:10:01,738 --> 01:10:07,500
fungi and so I better make certain of my

1611
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:12,179
bacterium fungi get a little bit of

1612
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:14,698
extra food so that they can multiply and

1613
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:17,100
maintain balance either that or you're

1614
01:10:14,698 --> 01:10:21,619
going to have some real shifts and

1615
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:24,360
swings and lots of good nutrient

1616
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:28,439
availability in the soil and all of a

1617
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:32,359
sudden because you put on the uh you

1618
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:35,519
know the the good guys for keeping the

1619
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:37,139
disease-causing bacteria in line you're

1620
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,540
also going to lose your good bacteria

1621
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:41,520
and now there's not enough nitrogen

1622
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:43,738
phosphorus sulfur magnesium calcium

1623
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,120
available to your plant around that root

1624
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:47,698
system

1625
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:50,460
so if we would only do it one route at a

1626
01:10:47,698 --> 01:10:52,379
time it might work but we're doing this

1627
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:55,380
to the whole system

1628
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:59,340
so I really do like to put these

1629
01:10:55,380 --> 01:11:00,920
organisms into the compost itself and

1630
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:05,100
let that

1631
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:08,460
Predator prey uh you know balance itself

1632
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:11,760
out and so when I put the compost out

1633
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:13,560
there it's already with adequate amounts

1634
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:17,820
of bacteria or fungi or Pros or

1635
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:19,400
nematodes or whatever as compared to the

1636
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:22,500
predatory

1637
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:26,519
organism that you put in there to shut

1638
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:28,859
down the disease causing or the pest

1639
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,860
um microarthropods out there

1640
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:34,439
this idea of having over dense

1641
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:36,119
beneficial insects is the first time

1642
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:39,238
that I've ever wrapped my head around

1643
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:42,119
the idea of actually listening to

1644
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:43,919
application rates because

1645
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:46,800
um you know I really had never thought

1646
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,199
about you know using so many that it

1647
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,260
that they would go and start to be

1648
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:54,839
opportunists on other necessary food

1649
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:56,640
sources that are not the target Pest and

1650
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,619
you know it's true you know when I when

1651
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,360
I reach out to my you know my covert rep

1652
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:02,460
and you know I don't have a big Garden

1653
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:05,519
but I figure out what I need with them

1654
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:07,679
and then and then I get my uh my my bugs

1655
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,380
and I'm like I'm like okay the the

1656
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:12,899
application rate says this much and then

1657
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:14,819
I apply it to my you know pretty pretty

1658
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:17,639
small garden and then I look and there's

1659
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:19,920
all this left in the bottle and I I'll

1660
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:22,820
cop to this I'm like I've got extra

1661
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,800
they'll be more safe if I add the rest

1662
01:12:22,819 --> 01:12:28,799
and and like I've done that every year

1663
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:31,079
and and now I'm realizing that it's

1664
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,760
actually working against me and really

1665
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:34,679
what I should do is hand those

1666
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:37,199
beneficial insects off to a friend for

1667
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:39,300
their Garden yeah yeah somebody else who

1668
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,719
can really use them and will see that

1669
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:46,140
benefit because you've used them before

1670
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:49,920
you probably have a certain amount of

1671
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:52,980
the beneficials present because they

1672
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:55,140
leave eggs they leave dormant stages and

1673
01:12:52,979 --> 01:12:56,119
they'll be up and moving doing their

1674
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:58,440
thing

1675
01:12:56,119 --> 01:13:01,079
you probably don't have to add as much

1676
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:03,719
in the second year so you know give it

1677
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:05,340
to friends give it to people and say you

1678
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:07,079
know tell me how it how it works out for

1679
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:09,739
you and then pretty soon you have

1680
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:09,738
another client

1681
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,600
I want to hit on the pathogen topic

1682
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:18,060
again you were talking about

1683
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,219
um you know when people drop necrotic

1684
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,840
leaves on the floor of the you know

1685
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:23,158
anywhere Greenhouse or outside in the

1686
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,480
garden or whatever

1687
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:26,698
um you know it's it's incredibly common

1688
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:30,479
for cannabis cultivators to defoliate

1689
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:33,178
their plants to open up air flow towards

1690
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:36,000
the inside or to remove yellowing leaves

1691
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:39,060
and and place them on the surface of the

1692
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,158
pot and you know the the the kind of Bro

1693
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:43,739
Science idea is to like you know return

1694
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:44,759
the nutrients in the leaf back to the

1695
01:13:43,738 --> 01:13:46,198
plant

1696
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,840
um it'll be good for the plant because

1697
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:51,000
I'm just returning nutrition but on

1698
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,520
shaping Fire episode 88 plant

1699
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,619
Pathologists Cora McGee suggested that

1700
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:58,560
all those leaves should be removed from

1701
01:13:55,619 --> 01:14:00,840
the cultivation area totally to prevent

1702
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,600
the spread of pathogens what are your

1703
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:06,719
thoughts on this very common practice of

1704
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,239
cultivators to put the like even the

1705
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,100
healthy leaves that they take off onto

1706
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:12,599
the top of the pot instead of you know

1707
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,539
removing them from the grow area to like

1708
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:18,719
the compost or something tip well if you

1709
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:21,140
have no biology in your dirt

1710
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:24,899
then yeah you have to do what she said

1711
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:29,640
because there's you know those leaves

1712
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:32,519
brown you know diseased happy you know

1713
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:34,560
good Leaf material

1714
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,699
there the diseases are going to take

1715
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,420
those over

1716
01:14:35,698 --> 01:14:43,019
and serve to increase the disease if you

1717
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:45,779
have no decent biology in that soil if

1718
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:48,960
you're trying to grow plants in dirt

1719
01:14:45,779 --> 01:14:51,479
it's not going to work very well but if

1720
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,579
you are using a biological approach and

1721
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:58,319
you've got these really good organisms

1722
01:14:53,579 --> 01:15:01,640
in your soil then the way to tell if

1723
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:04,319
it's working that you drop those

1724
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:08,579
infected leaves on the surface of your

1725
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:10,679
soil you should see by the next day that

1726
01:15:08,579 --> 01:15:12,719
things are happening these leaves are

1727
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:16,199
getting eaten they're being decomposed

1728
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,158
they're being turned into soil as you

1729
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:21,899
watch

1730
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:25,019
so how long is it going to take for a a

1731
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:26,879
small cannabis leaf to decompose a

1732
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,380
couple days

1733
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,480
um how about a bigger one what if we've

1734
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:32,340
got a real big well it would help if you

1735
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:34,979
shredded that up a little bit and put it

1736
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:38,219
on the surface of the soil because in in

1737
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:41,399
a couple days those materials would be

1738
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:45,060
gone as well you might still see the

1739
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:47,460
skeleton of the major veins for a couple

1740
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:49,140
more days than you see the green plant

1741
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,960
material

1742
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:54,239
um but it should all decompose if it

1743
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,719
doesn't decompose

1744
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:59,579
then Mother Nature is trying to tell you

1745
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:02,158
that you don't have all of the biology

1746
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:03,238
that you need in here please go get your

1747
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:07,079
microscope

1748
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:10,500
go take a look at what the biology is in

1749
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:12,779
this area why aren't they here

1750
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:15,840
because they should be if you use good

1751
01:16:12,779 --> 01:16:17,639
compost good compost teas you should

1752
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,260
have all of those organisms in the soil

1753
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,119
and that decomposition should be

1754
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:24,060
overnight

1755
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:26,279
so if it takes too long a time you

1756
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:28,560
probably want to try to figure out who

1757
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:30,599
killed your microorganisms in this part

1758
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,620
of the pile or in this part of the of

1759
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:37,140
your growing system or greenhouse and

1760
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:39,979
you know quite often we discover the

1761
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:43,560
places where your neighbor

1762
01:16:39,979 --> 01:16:45,678
sprayed something and that spray blew

1763
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,960
into your

1764
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:51,440
operation and so right here we're not

1765
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,359
seeing any decomposition because we got

1766
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:56,639
glyphosate in here and that killed your

1767
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:59,039
organisms well it's not going to take

1768
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,600
that much trouble for you to go get a

1769
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:03,300
little bit of your compost and sprinkle

1770
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:05,960
it over that area and make sure that the

1771
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:09,659
decomposition comes along right away

1772
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:12,480
and then you're good to go so we have

1773
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:15,479
very simple solutions to some of these

1774
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:17,279
quite complex problems that other people

1775
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:20,579
have

1776
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:22,500
it's interesting to tease out the

1777
01:17:20,579 --> 01:17:24,719
differences and perspectives of

1778
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:27,479
scientists because

1779
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,840
um uh I can see very clearly now that

1780
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:34,079
you know core offered that opinion

1781
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:37,860
because she works in a fusarium

1782
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:41,158
laboratory Greenhouse using sterile soil

1783
01:17:37,859 --> 01:17:44,039
because they're studying fusarium and so

1784
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:47,158
for her she doesn't have the strength in

1785
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:51,000
her growing system of a very active

1786
01:17:47,158 --> 01:17:52,500
living soil because that would get in

1787
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,719
the way of their measuring things right

1788
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,179
and and ensuring it so it's always

1789
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:58,859
interesting to to be able to tease that

1790
01:17:57,179 --> 01:18:01,020
out because so many people in Canada

1791
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:02,399
stay a little argue well you know this

1792
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:04,440
specialist thinks this and this

1793
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,119
specialist thinks that and and you know

1794
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:08,219
one of them has to be wrong and I'm

1795
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:10,859
always like you know you really only

1796
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:13,439
you've only learned that kind of like at

1797
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:15,179
a t-shirt quote level you know like like

1798
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,759
you really need to understand what's

1799
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:19,619
behind what they're thinking before or

1800
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,560
before you get all evangelist about it

1801
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:24,658
or especially angry about it yeah then

1802
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,640
you know ready to chew somebody up one

1803
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:29,519
side and down the other which is not a

1804
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:33,239
fun thing to to do when if they just

1805
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:36,420
took a step back viewed the system and

1806
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:37,799
realized what's actually going on

1807
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:40,679
um you know it

1808
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,239
we aren't going against the principles

1809
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:45,119
of

1810
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,859
um chemical agriculture we're just

1811
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,260
paying attention to what Mother Nature

1812
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:51,238
has already put in place and Mother

1813
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:53,760
Nature has been working in these systems

1814
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:56,519
well I've been working on this planet

1815
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:58,679
the ever since rooted plants arrived on

1816
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:02,100
the planet which was a billion years ago

1817
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:04,260
Mother Nature has had a billion years to

1818
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:06,420
figure out these interactions to keep

1819
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:10,679
all of these wonderful plants alive and

1820
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:12,239
functioning if she didn't work then we

1821
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:14,880
would be in serious trouble we wouldn't

1822
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,859
have these plants so we've got to learn

1823
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,460
the messages from nature we haven't

1824
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:22,619
figured them all out yet so you know

1825
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:24,899
please come work in the lab with us for

1826
01:19:22,619 --> 01:19:26,760
a while and discover all of these things

1827
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:28,939
and then you too can get your name in

1828
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,940
lights

1829
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:33,299
so

1830
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,980
um you know we're big fans of living

1831
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,840
soil I mean you and I both personally

1832
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:39,299
but also like shaping fire the program

1833
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,579
we we talk primarily about living soil

1834
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:44,659
we don't talk a whole lot about about

1835
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:49,619
Hydro unless it's you know a special

1836
01:19:44,658 --> 01:19:52,738
water food web kind of hydro setup but

1837
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:55,619
um using a blend of Coco coir and Pete

1838
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:57,479
is wildly popular in cannabis

1839
01:19:55,619 --> 01:20:01,559
cultivation at the moment especially

1840
01:19:57,479 --> 01:20:04,198
like bagged Coco choir and Pete with um

1841
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:06,360
often with you know pre-loaded with

1842
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:07,979
nutrients

1843
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:10,738
um and

1844
01:20:07,979 --> 01:20:12,658
um but it isn't soil right and and the

1845
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:16,139
biology of these pots seems like it

1846
01:20:12,658 --> 01:20:18,960
would be significantly lacking in soil

1847
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:20,760
food web biology that makes plant living

1848
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,679
in soil Thrive right because they don't

1849
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,079
have the the sand silt and clay and

1850
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:27,300
organic material in them

1851
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:28,079
um what are your thoughts like how do

1852
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,840
you

1853
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:34,738
um how do you teach this idea idea of of

1854
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:36,600
of the threshold between using soil

1855
01:20:34,738 --> 01:20:40,259
which has got you know sand silk clay

1856
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,860
organic material versus using

1857
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:44,159
um

1858
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:48,479
quar and Pete with with nutrients

1859
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:51,059
because they they both grow plants and

1860
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:53,399
people are very satisfied with their

1861
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:57,800
cocoa plants but I feel like they're

1862
01:20:53,399 --> 01:21:01,559
leaving some taste and pest resistance

1863
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:04,260
and resilience and health like like on

1864
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,600
the table because they're choosing like

1865
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:08,640
a half step and not going all the way to

1866
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:12,120
living soil what are your thoughts on

1867
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:14,940
these these cocoa peat mixes

1868
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:17,460
um cocoa and Pete

1869
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:19,799
um probably need to be sterile you know

1870
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:22,800
this is one of those situations where it

1871
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:25,860
probably because you've got the material

1872
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,560
in a plastic bag sealed and if there's

1873
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:30,899
any active organisms in there they're

1874
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,539
going to start growing on all that great

1875
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:36,679
organic material in there and your bag

1876
01:21:33,539 --> 01:21:40,979
is going to puff up and explode

1877
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:43,920
so they have to have used some kind of

1878
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:46,019
toxic material in order to kill off the

1879
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,579
organisms in that peat and coconut core

1880
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:50,520
could it just be like heat or pressure

1881
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:53,698
or does it could be it depends on

1882
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,719
exactly what they're set up to do so you

1883
01:21:53,698 --> 01:21:57,899
know one way or another they're

1884
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:59,579
denaturing it right they're exiting that

1885
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:02,339
from the system they're making certain

1886
01:21:59,579 --> 01:22:05,519
that their nothing's growing in there

1887
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:08,460
so now when you add your organism say in

1888
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:11,159
a good compost you're going to have see

1889
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:13,800
some initial lag before the the

1890
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:16,319
organisms really get going and and often

1891
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:20,640
if the concentration of that toxic

1892
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:23,039
material was really high you won't see

1893
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,800
any microbial growth and therefore

1894
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:29,399
you're you know you're not getting what

1895
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:32,760
you put the peat and or um and

1896
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:35,339
coconut core in there to do which is

1897
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:37,980
provide a food resource for the

1898
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:39,300
microorganisms that you want to help

1899
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:42,119
your plant

1900
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:45,179
when we get into an understanding of

1901
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:46,819
what's the difference between soil and

1902
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:52,500
dirt

1903
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:56,000
is just the mineral materials so the

1904
01:22:52,500 --> 01:23:01,140
sand the silts the Clays are

1905
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:04,979
produced by weathering and that used to

1906
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:08,280
be the biggest thing that could start

1907
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:10,678
breaking down the boulders and the

1908
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:13,500
parent material and the rocks and Etc

1909
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:15,719
into sand sound and play but as soon as

1910
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,399
microorganisms came along it's the

1911
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:21,000
microorganisms that do that

1912
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:22,920
decomposition of the Rocks Pebbles

1913
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,640
everything else and that's what's

1914
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:29,340
producing sand silk and clay so very

1915
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:30,780
specialized Niche you you don't need

1916
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:33,000
many of them because they're not really

1917
01:23:30,779 --> 01:23:36,238
going to be helping your plants along

1918
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,640
but Mother Nature needs to have them out

1919
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:41,158
there so we can go ahead and get those

1920
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:46,199
nutrients but

1921
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:48,359
um so what so I've defined dirt just the

1922
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:51,960
mineral component when you're talking

1923
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:54,779
about soil you have to add and this is

1924
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:58,079
according to the work of um hunts Jenny

1925
01:23:54,779 --> 01:24:00,840
one of the fathers of soil science he

1926
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,819
defines soil very clearly as being the

1927
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,719
mineral component the sand the silt the

1928
01:24:02,819 --> 01:24:06,238
clay

1929
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:10,319
but you also have to have organic matter

1930
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:12,859
in order to feed your microorganisms

1931
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:14,880
and then you have to have the beneficial

1932
01:24:12,859 --> 01:24:17,000
microorganisms the bacteria fungi

1933
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:20,460
protozoa and nematodes at the very least

1934
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,439
and then more at microarthropods

1935
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:25,260
macroarthropods spiders and all those

1936
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:27,779
things also play into a really good

1937
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,880
well-rounded soil

1938
01:24:27,779 --> 01:24:31,979
so that's the difference between those

1939
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:35,400
two things the

1940
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:36,559
um the mix that you talked about is just

1941
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:39,359
food

1942
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:43,380
organic matter that's all that's going

1943
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:46,799
in especially since they had to you uh

1944
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:49,980
you know destroy the biology on that

1945
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:53,779
organic material in order for it to sit

1946
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:57,359
happily on the Shelf in the greenhouse

1947
01:24:53,779 --> 01:25:01,738
in the store wherever they're storing it

1948
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:05,579
so we want to make certain that we get

1949
01:25:01,738 --> 01:25:09,779
that planting material out and mix it

1950
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:12,719
with our compost making sure that the

1951
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:14,819
compost isn't killed by the toxic

1952
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:17,158
chemicals that were used to kill

1953
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:20,219
everything in the in that organic matter

1954
01:25:17,158 --> 01:25:22,198
okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna take it one

1955
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:24,300
more step and put a little Sharper Edge

1956
01:25:22,198 --> 01:25:26,759
on it and the reason I'm doing this is

1957
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:29,100
because so many people so many you know

1958
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:30,840
newer Growers ask me about cocoa peat

1959
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,880
mixes and you know I don't I don't want

1960
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,679
to repeat inaccurate or incomplete

1961
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,319
information so I'm going to take it one

1962
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:41,158
more step let's say that we're that the

1963
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:45,000
person is using a cocoa peat mix that

1964
01:25:41,158 --> 01:25:48,000
has been denatured or sterilized with um

1965
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,520
with heat or pressure and so we're not

1966
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,439
talking about residual toxins and and

1967
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:54,719
then the folks bring it home and they

1968
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:58,198
they they they fill their you know

1969
01:25:54,719 --> 01:26:01,859
containers with the cocoa peat blend and

1970
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:04,519
then because they want to capture you

1971
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:08,399
know some active biological activity

1972
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:10,560
they'll pour compost teas in there and

1973
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:12,779
and it be you know many people have the

1974
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:16,100
ideas like okay now my preferred

1975
01:26:12,779 --> 01:26:18,840
substrate that I like to use now has

1976
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:22,139
microbe life in it because I just poured

1977
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:24,480
my my tea in there and I've always

1978
01:26:22,139 --> 01:26:26,760
resisted I this idea after uh Jeff

1979
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,500
lowenfels kind of said it real easy he

1980
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,900
said he said you know it's not living

1981
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:33,658
soil if if worms aren't living in there

1982
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:36,359
and and and you know that that generally

1983
01:26:33,658 --> 01:26:38,039
you know it doesn't apply to or that

1984
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:40,139
that's not going to happen in this kind

1985
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:43,139
of like cocoa peat mix I'm talking about

1986
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:44,940
so so what are your thoughts on a uh you

1987
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:47,520
know starting with a non-toxic but

1988
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:50,219
sterile cocopeat blend and then adding

1989
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,260
compost teas does does that get you

1990
01:26:50,219 --> 01:26:55,079
there

1991
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:57,840
um it certainly should especially if

1992
01:26:55,079 --> 01:26:59,579
that compost that you use to make the

1993
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:03,420
extract and then the tea

1994
01:26:59,579 --> 01:27:06,059
if it has the spores as well as any of

1995
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:08,460
the dormant stages washed off that leaf

1996
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:10,080
material that compost material and into

1997
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:16,100
the water that you're now going to

1998
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:18,899
inoculate on the peat moss and core

1999
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:21,539
it's always a question of how much you

2000
01:27:18,899 --> 01:27:24,899
don't want to overdo because that's a

2001
01:27:21,539 --> 01:27:27,859
really strong food resource and you

2002
01:27:24,899 --> 01:27:31,259
might have such a rapid growth of

2003
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:33,799
microorganisms in your beds that now

2004
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:37,800
that you're starting from zero yeah

2005
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:40,920
because you know you now let this you

2006
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:42,600
know goodly amount maybe too much

2007
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,699
um you know and how do you determine

2008
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:47,880
what's too little and what's too much

2009
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:50,939
and we often encourage our students to

2010
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:55,139
do a little bit of testing in small

2011
01:27:50,939 --> 01:28:00,299
containers so take a handful of your

2012
01:27:55,139 --> 01:28:04,199
compost take a handful of the p and core

2013
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:06,360
mixture and mix it all up now put some

2014
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:09,259
of your compost tea in there at the

2015
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:12,179
concentration that's the same as outside

2016
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:14,039
and watch and see what's happening and

2017
01:28:12,179 --> 01:28:17,158
if you come by the next morning and you

2018
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:19,079
go what is wrong with with the there's a

2019
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:21,719
smell in here where's that coming from

2020
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:23,698
so it smells like someone vomited and

2021
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:27,179
you realize that that's your little

2022
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:28,399
container of core and

2023
01:28:27,179 --> 01:28:31,920
Etc

2024
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:34,679
you put in too much biology that's too

2025
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:37,859
much food for them so you know crank

2026
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:39,239
down the amount of compost that you're

2027
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:43,380
putting in with all those great

2028
01:28:39,238 --> 01:28:45,839
organisms you know reduce it by half and

2029
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:47,819
see if you don't get a better effect you

2030
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,380
don't really want to be experimenting

2031
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:51,359
with something where you just put your

2032
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:53,819
valuable plants into

2033
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,559
and you know the next morning it's oh

2034
01:28:53,819 --> 01:28:58,439
surprise

2035
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:59,659
um how dead is that plant gonna be

2036
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:02,279
um so

2037
01:28:59,658 --> 01:29:04,379
that's the care that I would want to

2038
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:06,658
have people take get that microscope out

2039
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:08,279
take a look at the biology that's

2040
01:29:06,658 --> 01:29:11,099
present

2041
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:14,099
um as soon as you mixed everything

2042
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:16,739
together and then 24 hours later take

2043
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:19,500
another look and see that everything is

2044
01:29:16,738 --> 01:29:23,099
just gone gangbusters and you know it's

2045
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:27,238
Florida's ceiling bacteria squished into

2046
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:28,139
small places not what we want that's too

2047
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:31,019
rich

2048
01:29:28,139 --> 01:29:33,779
for your plan so back off so it sounds

2049
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:36,360
like if I were to kind of tie this all

2050
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:38,279
together into a you know a quickie best

2051
01:29:36,359 --> 01:29:39,779
practice it would be

2052
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:43,380
um if you

2053
01:29:39,779 --> 01:29:46,920
um uh prefer to use cocoa and peat and

2054
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:49,319
make make sure that they are denaturing

2055
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:51,840
from something non-toxic like pressure

2056
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:54,779
or heat and then once you get it to your

2057
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:57,900
house and you want to add biology to it

2058
01:29:54,779 --> 01:30:00,658
go ahead and use your compost teas but

2059
01:29:57,899 --> 01:30:02,460
start Slow and Low so that you you know

2060
01:30:00,658 --> 01:30:05,339
you don't you know push it too far too

2061
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:07,560
fast and I would think that I would want

2062
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:11,039
to encourage people to also use a

2063
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:13,500
variety of of teas and like

2064
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:16,019
um worm casting extracts and things like

2065
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:20,340
that so you're continuing to add variety

2066
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:22,620
to the pot in slow amounts as you go and

2067
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:26,400
you know it won't ever become living

2068
01:30:22,619 --> 01:30:28,920
soil but but if you've chosen cocoa this

2069
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:33,599
is going to be your your best way to

2070
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:35,579
also have a a active biology yeah and I

2071
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:40,020
you know for me it's a it's still a

2072
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:40,979
compost because the um core and the

2073
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:43,860
um

2074
01:30:40,979 --> 01:30:47,698
the peat moss those are just foods for

2075
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:50,279
your microorganisms so they're you know

2076
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:53,339
you're going to have to replenish that

2077
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:55,979
food or maybe you know as you're taking

2078
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:57,840
a little bit of compost you have a

2079
01:30:55,979 --> 01:30:59,459
little bit left over spread it out on

2080
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:03,719
this field so you get a little bit of

2081
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:05,819
the sand silk clay mixed in yeah I never

2082
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:07,920
really considered quora food and and as

2083
01:31:05,819 --> 01:31:09,000
it degrades I can see how it's how it

2084
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,880
would be I've always kind of thought of

2085
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,639
it as like akin to styrofoam yeah nope

2086
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:16,980
it's definitely a carbon Source yep and

2087
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:20,400
your fungi I need that bacteria don't

2088
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:22,379
like it much because bacteria have a

2089
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:25,500
carbon and nitrogen ratio typically down

2090
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:28,380
around 10 carbons for every one nitrogen

2091
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:31,139
which means all bacteria are desperately

2092
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:33,060
in search of nitrogen and they get all

2093
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:36,659
the carbon they could possibly ever use

2094
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:38,880
and they blow it off as CO2 so they are

2095
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:41,519
not the organisms we want in our soils

2096
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:43,319
if we're trying to sequester carbon

2097
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,840
you want to get the fungi growing

2098
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:50,158
because fungi have a c to n ratio of up

2099
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:53,039
around 100 to one and so the fungi will

2100
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:56,158
take all that that extra carbon and put

2101
01:31:53,039 --> 01:32:00,319
it inside its empty fungal tubes the

2102
01:31:56,158 --> 01:32:03,420
empty hyphy and that prevents

2103
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:08,460
microarthropods from being able to eat

2104
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:12,060
the um the the fungus so it's a really

2105
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:14,340
good way to put things away in a very

2106
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:16,620
safe place for a very long period of

2107
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:19,260
time so if you're ever thinking of

2108
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:21,119
carbon sequestration keep that in mind

2109
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:23,400
right on

2110
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:25,198
um I'm really grateful to that you went

2111
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:27,479
down that path with me because I'm much

2112
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:31,019
happier because you know historically my

2113
01:32:27,479 --> 01:32:32,579
my cocoa friends you know I I you know

2114
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:34,860
kind of make it a habit to ask them hard

2115
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:36,960
questions about the biology and instead

2116
01:32:34,859 --> 01:32:39,179
of being a jerk like that I can I can go

2117
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,859
to them like oh do you know Dr Elaine's

2118
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:43,619
best practices for this here let me

2119
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:45,000
support you in in your chosen way and I

2120
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:47,760
think that's a much better way to

2121
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,399
interact with my friends yeah I just you

2122
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:54,000
know why why are they taking the peat

2123
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:58,019
moss there's so many other good sources

2124
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,719
of food for the microorganisms in right

2125
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:03,060
around you in your natural biome in your

2126
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:06,539
in the habitat you're in why buy

2127
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:08,940
something like peat moss that's

2128
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:11,219
destroying an ecosystem someplace

2129
01:33:08,939 --> 01:33:14,219
and using that as food for your

2130
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:16,679
microorganisms why not you know well

2131
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:21,539
there's lots of other places where you

2132
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:24,899
could get waste organic matter and uh as

2133
01:33:21,539 --> 01:33:27,300
long as you keep in some eye on how much

2134
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:28,799
banana peel and how much oats and how

2135
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:32,480
much of you know what are your kids

2136
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:35,460
eating and you're putting in the garbage

2137
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:37,500
dry it out every night there are dryers

2138
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:40,679
that you can buy that are very

2139
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:42,479
inexpensive and then you just when you

2140
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:46,260
finish drying it down you just crunch

2141
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:47,819
everything up and put it in a bag in the

2142
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:50,940
refrigerator

2143
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:53,279
and so you can make your own

2144
01:33:50,939 --> 01:33:54,599
peat moss

2145
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:55,198
so

2146
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,500
um

2147
01:33:55,198 --> 01:34:00,960
while Pete certainly has a use use as a

2148
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:02,698
source most the time I'm hearing people

2149
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:06,000
say that they like the peat in the mix

2150
01:34:02,698 --> 01:34:09,539
because it retains water and it helps

2151
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:13,260
kind of like balance the water that's in

2152
01:34:09,539 --> 01:34:16,319
a container is there a uh is there

2153
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:20,039
something else that you prefer to Pete

2154
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:22,099
to help kind of stretch out a watering

2155
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:26,340
and kind of help

2156
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:28,620
regulate how wet the pot is or or rather

2157
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:30,840
that will sustain the watering a little

2158
01:34:28,619 --> 01:34:35,039
longer in a balanced way

2159
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:38,219
yeah um you want to get the particles in

2160
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:41,819
the um whatever you're like the my

2161
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:43,560
example of the food waste food in your

2162
01:34:41,819 --> 01:34:47,099
kitchen and you dry it down and you

2163
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:48,659
grind it up and now you take it out of

2164
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:50,940
wherever you're storing it because if

2165
01:34:48,658 --> 01:34:52,679
it's completely dry you don't have to

2166
01:34:50,939 --> 01:34:55,138
worry about it

2167
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:58,260
um and take that out now and how much

2168
01:34:55,139 --> 01:35:01,139
water will that dried material be able

2169
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:02,460
to hold and usually it's quite close to

2170
01:35:01,139 --> 01:35:06,619
peat moss

2171
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:09,179
so I kind of think of those kinds of

2172
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:11,760
materials because it's a diversity

2173
01:35:09,179 --> 01:35:14,219
you've got some potato you've got some

2174
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:18,199
banana you've got you know what else did

2175
01:35:14,219 --> 01:35:21,420
your kid not eat broccoli cauliflower

2176
01:35:18,198 --> 01:35:23,460
and you dry them down and now how much

2177
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:25,560
water will it take to wet that back up

2178
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:28,020
and I think you'd see it was very close

2179
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:30,000
to the peat moss thank you for that I've

2180
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:33,800
only ever thought about those scraps as

2181
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:36,719
a food source and not as a

2182
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,860
yeah totally so yeah all right so we're

2183
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,719
going to go ahead and take our second

2184
01:35:37,859 --> 01:35:41,460
short break and be right back you are

2185
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:43,930
listening to shaping fire and my guest

2186
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:46,500
today is Dr elenium

2187
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:48,840
[Music]

2188
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:51,179
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

2189
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:53,100
growing is so valued by Farmers is

2190
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:55,139
because the mycelium networks in the

2191
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:57,659
soil remain established from year to

2192
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:59,400
year and we know these fungal networks

2193
01:35:57,658 --> 01:36:01,679
are essential because they are the

2194
01:35:59,399 --> 01:36:03,960
nutrient super highways that extend far

2195
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:06,539
and wide in the substrate to feed your

2196
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:08,939
plants the trouble with growing in New

2197
01:36:06,539 --> 01:36:11,158
Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

2198
01:36:08,939 --> 01:36:13,559
is that it takes most of the plant's

2199
01:36:11,158 --> 01:36:14,960
life just to create these mycelium

2200
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:18,000
highways

2201
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:20,219
dynomico endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

2202
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,738
reduces that time and gets your plant

2203
01:36:20,219 --> 01:36:24,960
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

2204
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:27,658
and it's three times the concentration

2205
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:30,539
of the other popular brand in the U.S at

2206

900 propagules per gram of two fungal

01:36:30,539 --> 01:36:35,279
species selected specifically for

2208
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:36,960
cannabis cultivation dynomica is the

2209
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:39,000

love using dynamico to both speed up the

choose not only that if you pick the

2241

really sketchy ride and that's only one

2243
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:04,440

2294
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:03,300
for years organic cultivators have been

2295
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:05,279
looking for a peat moss replacement peat

2296
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:07,020
moss has long been the go-to soil

2297
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:09,179
amendment for water retention and

2298
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:11,880
container growing but organic Growers

2299
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:14,279
are recognizing now that peat moss is an

2300
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:17,279
unsustainable resource and the mining of

2301
01:40:14,279 --> 01:40:20,099
peat bogs destroys Wetland habitats and

2302
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:22,019
releases sequestered carbon but peat

2303
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:24,960
moss works so well that many have

2304
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:27,360
continued to use it now there is finally

2305
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,819
a revolutionary replacement for peat

2306
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:31,979
moss that provides better benefits while

2307
01:40:29,819 --> 01:40:35,340
being a sustainable choice

2308
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:37,619
pit Moss sounds and acts like peat moss

2309
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:39,900
but instead of being mined from fragile

2310
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:41,939
ecosystems is actually made from

2311
01:40:39,899 --> 01:40:44,099
upcycled organic paper and cardboard

2312
01:40:41,939 --> 01:40:46,619

2313
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:48,600
pittmoss is excellent at retaining water

2314
01:40:46,619 --> 01:40:50,639
in your substrate and creating air

2315

carefully and locally sourced pittmoss

2320
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:05,819
is the result of decades-long research

2321
01:41:02,819 --> 01:41:08,158
into the use of recycled paper fibers

2322
01:41:05,819 --> 01:41:10,198
pittmoss is lightweight and easy to use

2323
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:11,759
and pit Moss is an earth so it won't

welcome back you are listening to

shaping fire I'm your host shangolos and

2341
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:56,519
my guest today is Dr Elaine Ingham

2342
01:41:54,179 --> 01:41:59,158
so Dr Elaine you know in regenerative

2343
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:01,440
farming we do our best to mimic nature

2344
01:41:59,158 --> 01:42:04,618
itself to support it and you know use

2345
01:42:01,439 --> 01:42:08,000
nature to repair itself does that make a

2346
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:13,079
case for cultivators to emphasize

2347
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:15,960
compost extracts over aerated compost

2348
01:42:13,079 --> 01:42:18,600
teas because you know burgeoning

2349
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:20,880
incubated populations of oxygen loving

2350
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:23,400
microbes are pretty unlikely to occur

2351
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:25,859
naturally in the soil while compost

2352
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:29,698
extracts really more effectively

2353
01:42:25,859 --> 01:42:31,979
biomimic what happens in nature by

2354
01:42:29,698 --> 01:42:34,618
seeping into plant material and then

2355
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:36,658
seeping through it as we find in nature

2356
01:42:34,618 --> 01:42:38,939
so so how should we wrap our heads

2357
01:42:36,658 --> 01:42:41,359
around that

2358
01:42:38,939 --> 01:42:44,698
um it's one of these cases of it depends

2359
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:50,039
you have to take a step back and look at

2360
01:42:44,698 --> 01:42:53,279
what you want as the outcome of applying

2361
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:55,679
these different materials so for example

2362
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:58,618
with a compost you're going to put it

2363
01:42:55,679 --> 01:43:01,020
down someplace that needs the organic

2364
01:42:58,618 --> 01:43:03,839
matter as well as the organisms

2365
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:07,260
replenished in that soil and so

2366
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:12,179
typically right down the furrow or you

2367
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:14,340
know right around the trees in a in a uh

2368
01:43:12,179 --> 01:43:17,158
Orchard or something you know something

2369
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:20,340
you know shrubs or blueberries whatever

2370
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:23,638
and when we're looking at compost tea

2371
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:28,800
that's really the organisms as they

2372
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:29,480
typically exist in our close

2373
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:33,020
um

2374
01:43:29,479 --> 01:43:37,979
the closest we ever come to making soil

2375
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:41,760
we those organisms we want to extract uh

2376
01:43:37,979 --> 01:43:43,500
the concentration that you need to put

2377
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:46,380
into your system

2378
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:48,600
to get the biology back up to where it

2379
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:51,060
belongs so when we're when we're going

2380
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:53,100
through succession and we're trying to

2381
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:55,560
understand that early in succession is

2382
01:43:53,100 --> 01:44:00,179
strictly bacterial Midway through

2383
01:43:55,560 --> 01:44:02,699
succession it's 50 50 fungi bacteria

2384
01:44:00,179 --> 01:44:06,179
when it's you know in an old growth

2385
01:44:02,698 --> 01:44:08,479
forest it's uh you know a hundred to a

2386
01:44:06,179 --> 01:44:12,560
thousand times more

2387
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:15,419
fungi than bacteria in the system and so

2388
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:21,320
understanding that we are going to

2389
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:24,779
extract the compost and apply it

2390
01:44:21,319 --> 01:44:27,779
as that amendment of everybody's going

2391
01:44:24,779 --> 01:44:29,819
to be asleep normally that is supposed

2392
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:31,920
to be asleep at that time anything

2393
01:44:29,819 --> 01:44:34,019
that's supposed to be happening now

2394
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:37,079
that's already happening in the compost

2395
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:39,719
so when you do the extraction these

2396
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:42,658
organisms go out hopefully more or less

2397
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:44,819
in the balances that we want to see so

2398
01:44:42,658 --> 01:44:47,519
we'll take a look using our microscopes

2399
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:49,559
to determine if what I'm putting on is

2400
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:52,560
strictly bacterial and that's going to

2401
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:55,380
help those early successional systems

2402
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:58,940
that we probably don't want because

2403
01:44:55,380 --> 01:45:02,639
early successional systems are

2404
01:44:58,939 --> 01:45:05,158
are going to be mostly weeds and you

2405
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:07,199
know things that aren't crops there are

2406
01:45:05,158 --> 01:45:11,238
not really anything that farmers want to

2407
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:13,439
see if we improve that fungal component

2408
01:45:11,238 --> 01:45:16,439
then we're going to be putting on an

2409
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:18,539
equal biomass of fungi and bacteria and

2410
01:45:16,439 --> 01:45:21,118
we're selecting for the more productive

2411
01:45:18,539 --> 01:45:25,380
plants in the system you know grasses

2412
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:27,359
and vegetables those kinds of plants as

2413
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:30,000
we go over the edge into a fungal

2414
01:45:27,359 --> 01:45:31,439
dominated system and now we're promoting

2415
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,979
the growth of

2416
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:37,319
shrubs and trees

2417
01:45:33,979 --> 01:45:40,678
the higher in that successional process

2418
01:45:37,319 --> 01:45:42,840
up into the old growth system we're

2419
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:48,060
going to be just pushing fungi like

2420
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:51,840
crazy so how much biology do you need to

2421
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:53,820
be putting out and of what type so

2422
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:57,719
answering those kinds of questions if

2423
01:45:53,819 --> 01:46:01,559
we've made a compost tea extracted the

2424
01:45:57,719 --> 01:46:03,600
organisms from the compost into a liquid

2425
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:06,539
form because it's way easier to apply a

2426
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:09,119
liquid than it is to apply that solid

2427
01:46:06,539 --> 01:46:12,899
material we're drenching right around

2428
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:15,960
the base of all of the plants that we

2429
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:18,118
are concerned about that we want to get

2430
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:22,319
growing and making sure that that fungal

2431
01:46:18,118 --> 01:46:25,139
bacterial ratio is what it needs to be

2432
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:30,359
so typically that's what we're going to

2433
01:46:25,139 --> 01:46:33,300
be applying we will let that do its

2434
01:46:30,359 --> 01:46:34,979
thing about for about a week and we'll

2435
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:37,800
go back and take a

2436
01:46:34,979 --> 01:46:40,439
um another sample and look at what's

2437
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:42,719
happened in that soil has the biology

2438
01:46:40,439 --> 01:46:44,698
improved and if we're trying for

2439
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:47,340
something that's equal biomass fungi and

2440
01:46:44,698 --> 01:46:50,158
bacteria are both bacterium fungi

2441
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:52,440
getting higher and higher in value

2442
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:55,138
that's what we want to see so we're

2443
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:57,960
constantly checking what if you see the

2444
01:46:55,139 --> 01:47:00,539
you know the place that you were hoping

2445
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:03,260
for both bacteria and fungi to grow and

2446
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:07,139
the fungi are just taken off like crazy

2447
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:09,780
well that's not good for the plant we're

2448
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:12,840
trying to grow our plan needs equal

2449
01:47:09,779 --> 01:47:16,859
biomass so we'll go back and we'll

2450
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:20,100
develop like a compost tea where we're

2451
01:47:16,859 --> 01:47:22,738
going to be putting in bacterial Foods

2452
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:24,719
so we're getting the bacteria up to

2453
01:47:22,738 --> 01:47:26,279
where it's going to equal what's going

2454
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:28,500
on with the fungi

2455
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:30,300
and so then that gets applied well what

2456
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:33,479
if it was the other way around well then

2457
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:35,279
we would put in foods that would improve

2458
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:38,579
the

2459
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:42,000
um the fungi instead of the bacteria so

2460
01:47:38,579 --> 01:47:44,219
we have these you know tests along the

2461
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,639
way to make sure everything's going the

2462
01:47:44,219 --> 01:47:50,039
right direction if you don't have a

2463
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:52,440
microscope and you put things on you're

2464
01:47:50,039 --> 01:47:55,019
just crossing your fingers and hoping

2465
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:57,479
that mother nature is going to be kind

2466
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:59,639
to you and you know Mother Nature I

2467
01:47:57,479 --> 01:48:01,439
think has a not so wonderful attitude

2468
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:03,659
about human beings

2469
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:07,919
because we have not been doing nice

2470
01:48:03,658 --> 01:48:11,099
things to her work on this planet

2471
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:13,560
and so we've got to fix this and get it

2472
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:16,679
back to where it needs to be and so here

2473
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:22,020
you have all of the tools that you need

2474
01:48:16,679 --> 01:48:24,719
to have now with a compost tea in

2475
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:27,659
general the reason why we would be

2476
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:30,840
making a compost tea is because we've

2477
01:48:27,658 --> 01:48:32,279
got to up the amount of bacteria or

2478
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:36,420
fungi

2479
01:48:32,279 --> 01:48:40,439
we also when we're looking at the above

2480
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:43,859
ground part of the plant the form of um

2481
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:46,439
putting the biology back out there is

2482
01:48:43,859 --> 01:48:49,859
going to be as a compost tea because we

2483
01:48:46,439 --> 01:48:51,178
want to look and see what's going on if

2484
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:53,639
um

2485
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:55,319
everything's going just fine it probably

2486
01:48:53,639 --> 01:48:58,679
would put out something that was equal

2487
01:48:55,319 --> 01:49:00,960
biomass fungi and bacteria for any tree

2488
01:48:58,679 --> 01:49:02,579
that's out there well you do want to

2489
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:05,819
play pay attention to your soil because

2490
01:49:02,579 --> 01:49:08,880
when you apply the tea to the foliage

2491
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:13,139
you're also be going to be getting some

2492
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:15,420
of the compost tea on the ground so you

2493
01:49:13,139 --> 01:49:17,100
know it got to be looking at what's

2494
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:19,500
going on in the ground you've got to be

2495
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:22,760
looking at what's happening in the

2496
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:25,079
um in the foliage so that you determine

2497
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:26,880
what kind of tea are you going to be

2498
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:29,158
making what kinds of foods are you going

2499
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,659
to be adding into that system

2500
01:49:29,158 --> 01:49:34,259
so

2501
01:49:30,658 --> 01:49:36,839
I mostly only use compost teas if I've

2502
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:39,780
got disease-causing problems in the

2503
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:42,060
foliage and then it's strictly a foliar

2504
01:49:39,779 --> 01:49:46,139
spray I'm not I'm drenching it on the

2505
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:48,800
soil at all and so we typically get rid

2506
01:49:46,139 --> 01:49:51,539
of those diseases very rapidly

2507
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:55,079
if you can get out at the beginning of

2508
01:49:51,539 --> 01:49:58,560
the growing season you know that there's

2509
01:49:55,079 --> 01:50:03,719
a particular disease that this Orchard

2510
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:06,060
or this these plants are very likely to

2511
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:08,399
have problems they have

2512
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:10,440
you know the Growers are saying you know

2513
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:12,479
every year we've been applying these

2514
01:50:10,439 --> 01:50:14,519
toxic chemicals and the toxic chemicals

2515
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:17,879
just aren't doing the job anymore what

2516
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:19,440
are we supposed to do well you come

2517
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:22,319
along and we'll put the compost tea out

2518
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:25,379
there and it does a very good job on

2519
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:27,899
dealing with every disease organisms

2520
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:30,539
there's several recent papers in the

2521
01:50:27,899 --> 01:50:33,420
scientific literature showing that if

2522
01:50:30,539 --> 01:50:36,359
they put a good compost tea out that

2523
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:39,179
they can deal with fusarium

2524
01:50:36,359 --> 01:50:40,920
um no problem there you know when we're

2525
01:50:39,179 --> 01:50:43,319
dealing with different you know like

2526
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:46,739
Dutch elm disease no problem there we've

2527
01:50:43,319 --> 01:50:49,500
got that one figured out so in some

2528
01:50:46,738 --> 01:50:52,439
cases we may have to go into the

2529
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:56,300
plantation or into the agricultural

2530
01:50:52,439 --> 01:51:00,359
field and figure out

2531
01:50:56,300 --> 01:51:02,060
how to get rid of a disease by applying

2532
01:51:00,359 --> 01:51:04,500
in the foliage

2533
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:06,780
and most of the time we get it figured

2534
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:10,139
out after you know just a couple weeks

2535
01:51:06,779 --> 01:51:12,840
what we need to do to give constant

2536
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:15,118
protection to the plant and remember

2537
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:18,179
that it's not just the organisms you're

2538
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:20,698
putting out it's the fact that you're

2539
01:51:18,179 --> 01:51:22,920
getting nutrient cycling going again in

2540
01:51:20,698 --> 01:51:25,259
the root system you're making certain

2541
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:29,158
that that plant has all the nutrients it

2542
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:32,460
needs to express the disease protection

2543
01:51:29,158 --> 01:51:36,059
to express that resistance to diseases

2544
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:40,618
and pests and problem organisms so it's

2545
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:43,400
a whole system working together and so

2546
01:51:40,618 --> 01:51:46,738
hopefully you can see why it's

2547
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:48,599
it depends kind of answer yeah it is it

2548
01:51:46,738 --> 01:51:50,819
depends kind of answer and I don't want

2549
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:54,420
to I want to focus on one thing you said

2550
01:51:50,819 --> 01:51:57,599
because uh perhaps I misunderstood

2551
01:51:54,420 --> 01:52:00,480
um I believe I heard you say that you

2552
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:03,119
really only use compost tea

2553
01:52:00,479 --> 01:52:06,899
um if there is an imbalance in the plant

2554
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:10,679
and then if you do use it you use it as

2555
01:52:06,899 --> 01:52:12,359
a foliar and not as a root drench and

2556
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:16,739
and if I heard you correctly my question

2557
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:20,039
is this if if it's important for us that

2558
01:52:16,738 --> 01:52:22,799
the plant has the nutrition it needs to

2559
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:25,679
remain robust and have an active

2560
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:28,079
rhizosphere so everybody's commuting and

2561
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:32,520
communicating and trading and the plants

2562
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:36,079
getting what its needs if if if there's

2563
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:39,960
if I'm not act adding more

2564
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:43,618
nutrition and active biology via a

2565
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:46,500
compost tea are is the nutrition that

2566
01:52:43,618 --> 01:52:49,738
you're referring to Simply amendments

2567
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:52,020
that you have added in advance before

2568
01:52:49,738 --> 01:52:55,079
the life cycle of the plant

2569
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:57,119
well new I was trying to go through the

2570
01:52:55,079 --> 01:53:00,840
the succession of treatments that we

2571
01:52:57,118 --> 01:53:01,759
usually do in um and and trying to deal

2572
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:04,500
with

2573
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:06,900
that it was only in that one case that

2574
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:08,819
that you wouldn't use a root trends like

2575
01:53:06,899 --> 01:53:11,219
no like you would use it in other cases

2576
01:53:08,819 --> 01:53:12,840
so yeah when I understand when you first

2577
01:53:11,219 --> 01:53:16,020
go out and take a look at what's in the

2578
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:18,119
soil and you go oh my gosh there the

2579
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:21,119
only thing I find here are bacteria and

2580
01:53:18,118 --> 01:53:23,519
they are really not very good bacteria

2581
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:25,559
because that's all that can grow with

2582
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:28,980
the toxic chemicals and the inorganic

2583
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:31,739
salts and all this tillage it's the only

2584
01:53:28,979 --> 01:53:35,579
thing that's surviving and so our first

2585
01:53:31,738 --> 01:53:37,500
applications are going to be compost if

2586
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:39,960
you don't have enough organic matter in

2587
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:43,198
your soil to grow your microorganisms

2588
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:44,819
and that cut off is three percent so one

2589
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:47,399
of the biggest things will have to do

2590
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:49,738
when we've got those kinds of problems

2591
01:53:47,399 --> 01:53:52,799
is get out there with more organic

2592
01:53:49,738 --> 01:53:55,379
matter well guess what is your

2593
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:58,739
um in your compost it's organic matter

2594
01:53:55,380 --> 01:54:03,420
and organisms so get it out there so

2595
01:53:58,738 --> 01:54:06,000
we'll come back two weeks later and we

2596
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:08,340
may go in Furrow at that point where

2597
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,920
we're putting the compost tea down in

2598
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:14,760
Furrow but we want to make certain that

2599
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:16,800
we've got the balance right so before so

2600
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:19,260
we here we are we've put the compost

2601
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:21,119
down if we need to

2602
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:23,460
um and two weeks a week or two weeks

2603
01:54:21,118 --> 01:54:26,039
later we'll come back and take another

2604
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:28,439
look at the biology and make sure it's

2605
01:54:26,039 --> 01:54:31,560
getting going in the right direction

2606
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:35,879
and then that determines for us what's

2607
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:37,560
still missing and so what do we have to

2608
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:39,840
um what kind of compost are we going to

2609
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:43,860
use we're going to be extracting these

2610
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:46,639
organisms to uh put into the soil as a

2611
01:54:43,859 --> 01:54:49,799
as a drench going along the row

2612
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:52,639
and we may have to repeat that once or

2613
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:54,779
twice before we can get the balance the

2614
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:56,340
microorganisms back up to what it needs

2615
01:54:54,779 --> 01:54:58,319
to be

2616
01:54:56,340 --> 01:55:01,500
um and then we're going to really turn

2617
01:54:58,319 --> 01:55:04,979
our attention to what are the diseases

2618
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:09,118
that these that the client has

2619
01:55:04,979 --> 01:55:13,738
um shown our problems and so now we're

2620
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:16,198
going to uh determine the compost tea

2621
01:55:13,738 --> 01:55:20,218
that we're likely to have to apply

2622
01:55:16,198 --> 01:55:22,618
because of you know is it a you know

2623
01:55:20,219 --> 01:55:25,020
there's too many disease causes too many

2624
01:55:22,618 --> 01:55:27,658
diseases for me to mention but you know

2625
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:32,119
based on this disease we're going to

2626
01:55:27,658 --> 01:55:36,839
make a compost tea that will vary

2627
01:55:32,118 --> 01:55:39,479
strongly suppress those diseases that

2628
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:43,639
are strictly foliar if it's a root

2629
01:55:39,479 --> 01:55:47,279
disease we would probably go back to

2630
01:55:43,639 --> 01:55:49,618
drenching the soil or maybe if it's a

2631
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:53,039
really specific part of the tree that is

2632
01:55:49,618 --> 01:55:54,839
showing disease symptoms and conifers

2633
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:59,719
are much more likely to behave in that

2634
01:55:54,840 --> 01:56:04,679
fashion we'll inject the compost extract

2635
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:08,279
into the soil around that in a infected

2636
01:56:04,679 --> 01:56:12,600
root and kind of hope that that takes

2637
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:14,698
care of the disease in that root you

2638
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:17,219
know if it doesn't that's going to kill

2639
01:56:14,698 --> 01:56:23,399
that plant and when should we take it

2640
01:56:17,219 --> 01:56:25,618
down now or try to baby this one very

2641
01:56:23,399 --> 01:56:27,539
sick tree should we take it down you

2642
01:56:25,618 --> 01:56:30,059
have to your client is the person who's

2643
01:56:27,539 --> 01:56:31,920
going to make that call I understand

2644
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:32,820
um thanks for breaking that out a bit

2645
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,500
more

2646
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:36,238
um it's it's interesting how any

2647
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:38,399
conversation

2648
01:56:36,238 --> 01:56:40,799
um about you know is for somebody who's

2649
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:43,138
taking their soils seriously and

2650
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:45,300
thinking about varieties of compost tea

2651
01:56:43,139 --> 01:56:48,000
it always comes back to microscope

2652
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:49,860
skills it really does it's like you know

2653
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,479
for for a decade we were making sure

2654
01:56:49,859 --> 01:56:53,819
we're trying to encourage you know

2655
01:56:51,479 --> 01:56:55,259
cannabis Growers to get soil tests right

2656
01:56:53,819 --> 01:56:57,000
even though they're afraid to send their

2657
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:58,679
soil in and because people were

2658
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
generally you know hiding and they

2659
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:01,980
didn't want to send in soil tests you

2660
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,319
know eventually it got safe enough to

2661
01:57:01,979 --> 01:57:05,759
send in soil tests and such

2662
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:07,139
um and so you know people are pretty

2663
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,360
well established that beyond the

2664
01:57:07,139 --> 01:57:11,760
importance of a soil test but right on

2665
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:13,500
those heels is is basic microscope

2666
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:15,800
skills so that you can understand what's

2667
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:18,840
going on in your soil and your compost

2668
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:21,539
yeah and it's uh it's easier to do the

2669
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:23,940
micro scope work yourself rather than

2670
01:57:21,539 --> 01:57:26,939
sending it off to a laboratory where

2671
01:57:23,939 --> 01:57:30,259
you're not quite sure what kind of

2672
01:57:26,939 --> 01:57:35,479
methodology they're using to extract the

2673
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:38,099
soluble in the total in the exchangeable

2674
01:57:35,479 --> 01:57:40,799
all of those different things and you

2675
01:57:38,099 --> 01:57:43,500
know as people hand me so a chemistry

2676
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:47,340
reports and you know it's got like a

2677
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:50,579
column of numbers behind you know titles

2678
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:53,699
like phosphate sulfate things like that

2679
01:57:50,579 --> 01:57:56,698
and it's like this is meaningless I I

2680
01:57:53,698 --> 01:57:59,879
you've got to know what extraction

2681
01:57:56,698 --> 01:58:04,500
agencies they've been using context is

2682
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:08,159
for the numbers yeah yeah and uh so yeah

2683
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:10,859
and it's it's really easy to find that

2684
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:12,839
that information that's important and

2685
01:58:10,859 --> 01:58:14,399
what do you have to do to make get this

2686
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:16,199
plan back into a really healthy

2687
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:18,500
condition

2688
01:58:16,198 --> 01:58:21,960
um a lot of times I find that chemical

2689
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:23,099
analysis is isn't much help

2690
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:26,880
um

2691
01:58:23,099 --> 01:58:29,279
yeah and we're working on trying to

2692
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:31,260
really figure that out for people so

2693
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:34,759
that there'll be a publication coming

2694
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:38,639
along that really helps them integrate

2695
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:41,880
what what's going on with the with the

2696
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:46,679
nutrients from what the biology is doing

2697
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:48,179
as well as having some of the soluble

2698
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:48,960
and

2699
01:58:48,179 --> 01:58:53,699
um

2700
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:55,079
total nutrient values in the system help

2701
01:58:53,698 --> 01:58:56,819
people really figure out what they're

2702
01:58:55,079 --> 01:58:58,559
doing excellent well we'll we'll look

2703
01:58:56,819 --> 01:59:00,599
forward to that report this next

2704
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,039
question I think is a lot simpler than

2705
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:03,840
the last couple

2706
01:59:02,039 --> 01:59:07,560
um you know it's it's it's really common

2707
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:10,860
uh towards the end of a bloom cycle in

2708
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:15,420
cannabis for Growers to stop water

2709
01:59:10,859 --> 01:59:19,679
before Harvest day and

2710
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:21,480
um my mentor did that and um you know he

2711
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:23,219
said well it's it's like a tomato plant

2712
01:59:21,479 --> 01:59:25,379
we're letting it know it's at the end of

2713
01:59:23,219 --> 01:59:27,300
its season and we want to decrease the

2714
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:30,239
total moisture volume in the plant so

2715
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:32,219
it's a little easier to dry I'm like but

2716
01:59:30,238 --> 01:59:35,819
in my thoughts it's always been I would

2717
01:59:32,219 --> 01:59:37,980
want to be watering my soil biology you

2718
01:59:35,819 --> 01:59:40,738
know all the way through Harvest because

2719
01:59:37,979 --> 01:59:44,039
without water I'm going to start losing

2720
01:59:40,738 --> 01:59:46,500
my stable balanced microbe life as they

2721
01:59:44,039 --> 01:59:48,479
start going to sleep and and then that

2722
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:50,399
really really tells the plant that it's

2723
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:52,138
the end of the season and and that you

2724
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:54,658
know perhaps it's time for molds to take

2725
01:59:52,139 --> 01:59:57,079
over to recycle the plant so I really

2726
01:59:54,658 --> 02:00:01,500
want a key I think I want to keep my

2727
01:59:57,079 --> 02:00:03,899
microbiology like strong and moistured

2728
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:05,939
um right up to harvest day but you know

2729
02:00:03,899 --> 02:00:07,920
I I certainly am I'm willing to be

2730
02:00:05,939 --> 02:00:10,678
inaccurate so so what are your thoughts

2731
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:13,020
about this common practice to stopping

2732
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:14,579
watering plants in containers like a

2733
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:16,980
week before Harvest

2734
02:00:14,579 --> 02:00:20,639
I I don't think is really going to do

2735
02:00:16,979 --> 02:00:22,799
thicker organisms in your soil any harm

2736
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:25,618
um you're getting them ready for at you

2737
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:30,000
know the Harvest period being gone

2738
02:00:25,618 --> 02:00:32,880
um so these organisms are have been of

2739
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,880
course building aggregate structure in

2740
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:38,819
the soil around the roots to hold on to

2741
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:41,159
water and so if anything what's

2742
02:00:38,819 --> 02:00:44,340
happening is you're getting the plant to

2743
02:00:41,158 --> 02:00:47,579
go deeper put those roots down deeper

2744
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:48,599
into the soil to grab the water that it

2745
02:00:47,579 --> 02:00:52,500
needs

2746
02:00:48,599 --> 02:00:54,599
so the plant has mechanisms for upping

2747
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:58,439
the amount of water that it'll take out

2748
02:00:54,599 --> 02:01:01,159
of the soil around its root system and

2749
02:00:58,439 --> 02:01:05,219
so I'm not sure how much good it really

2750
02:01:01,158 --> 02:01:07,319
for a week is probably not enough to

2751
02:01:05,219 --> 02:01:08,939
affect the growth of that plant in any

2752
02:01:07,319 --> 02:01:09,899
way

2753
02:01:08,939 --> 02:01:14,158
um

2754
02:01:09,899 --> 02:01:16,079
so in really dry arid areas maybe so you

2755
02:01:14,158 --> 02:01:18,479
know so it would be interesting to look

2756
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:21,658
at that uh what goes on with the biology

2757
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:25,198
around the root system as you're letting

2758
02:01:21,658 --> 02:01:27,359
this drying process happen you're not

2759
02:01:25,198 --> 02:01:28,919
going to lose any species they're just

2760
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:31,500
going to go dormant

2761
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:34,920
and especially with water you know

2762
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:36,479
they've got a fair amount of time to

2763
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:39,359
respond to the fact that the water

2764
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:43,138
really is drying out and it really is

2765
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:45,539
time to go get into dormant form so when

2766
02:01:43,139 --> 02:01:47,659
you come through and you harvest you

2767
02:01:45,539 --> 02:01:50,639
have less damage from the Harvest

2768
02:01:47,658 --> 02:01:53,339
because the organisms are already going

2769
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:55,139
sound to sleep

2770
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:57,900
um yeah I don't

2771
02:01:55,139 --> 02:02:00,779
it doesn't doesn't really ring my bells

2772
02:01:57,899 --> 02:02:02,339
at all to to get worried about that so

2773
02:02:00,779 --> 02:02:04,139
let's talk about something specifically

2774
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:06,480
for the indoor cultivators for a moment

2775
02:02:04,139 --> 02:02:09,840
Elaine you know many indoor cultivators

2776
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:11,459
uh try to mimic outdoor regenerative

2777
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:13,500
techniques in their Gardens because

2778
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:15,420
perhaps they don't have access to

2779
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:17,099
outdoor space or maybe they live

2780
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:19,679
somewhere where the weather is just not

2781
02:02:17,099 --> 02:02:22,079
going to play ball and so they want to

2782
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:24,480
grow indoors but they don't want to go

2783
02:02:22,079 --> 02:02:27,000
the whole you know you know you know

2784
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:28,379
two-part salts game because they want to

2785
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:32,039
be

2786
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:33,960
um you know using a healthier cannabis

2787
02:02:32,039 --> 02:02:36,060
themselves and so you know perhaps

2788
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:38,279
they're still in pots but you know it's

2789
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:41,300
becoming very common to use four by four

2790
02:02:38,279 --> 02:02:44,099
or four by eight indoor beds

2791
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:47,639
but being indoors there's a clear limit

2792
02:02:44,099 --> 02:02:50,520
to how much soil food web biomimicry can

2793
02:02:47,639 --> 02:02:52,500
take place because there's so much of

2794
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:54,300
nature that you're not

2795
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:58,158
um participating in and that you just

2796
02:02:54,300 --> 02:03:01,500
can't mimic indoors in a tent

2797
02:02:58,158 --> 02:03:04,559
for indoor folks how should we think

2798
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:07,859
about you know that natural limit to how

2799
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:10,440
much biomimicry we can do and best adapt

2800
02:03:07,859 --> 02:03:13,139
our indoor gardens in attempt to you

2801
02:03:10,439 --> 02:03:16,279
know make them as true as possible to

2802
02:03:13,139 --> 02:03:16,279
the soil food web

2803
02:03:16,618 --> 02:03:20,158
um yeah the biggest problem I think is

2804
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:22,079
going to be that the roots should be

2805
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:25,439
growing down

2806
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:28,198
um and not out to the sides uh and and I

2807
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:31,019
said I suppose if you had a situation

2808
02:03:28,198 --> 02:03:31,859
where that's the only

2809
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:34,860
um

2810
02:03:31,859 --> 02:03:38,819
you know you you don't have some place

2811
02:03:34,859 --> 02:03:41,158
where you can hang the baskets with the

2812
02:03:38,819 --> 02:03:42,960
plants growing in it up at you know six

2813
02:03:41,158 --> 02:03:45,598
or eight feet high

2814
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:47,698
so the root systems can go down into a

2815
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:51,179
trench that you would dig in in the

2816
02:03:47,698 --> 02:03:54,598
floor that's a novel thing to picture

2817
02:03:51,179 --> 02:03:58,079
yeah take the boards out between your

2818
02:03:54,599 --> 02:04:00,060
ground floor and the and the uh you know

2819
02:03:58,079 --> 02:04:02,760
basement if you could

2820
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:05,940
um you know have the the above ground

2821
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:09,360
part up in a you know a a bubble window

2822
02:04:05,939 --> 02:04:11,939
and then the pot and with the roots

2823
02:04:09,359 --> 02:04:12,719
growing down into your basement

2824
02:04:11,939 --> 02:04:16,319
um

2825
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:18,719
you might be able to be more typical of

2826
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:20,340
what we want to have occurring out in

2827
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:22,139
the in the field

2828
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:25,199
but what if your field isn't actually

2829
02:04:22,139 --> 02:04:28,319
doing that your your field is

2830
02:04:25,198 --> 02:04:30,598
um compacted at some depth

2831
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:33,840
um and The Roots will only grow down to

2832
02:04:30,599 --> 02:04:37,159
that depth they will tend to go sideways

2833
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:41,760
then and be fighting with the next

2834
02:04:37,158 --> 02:04:44,219
plants over because they're all not

2835
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,360
getting the nutrients or the water that

2836
02:04:44,219 --> 02:04:49,198
they need

2837
02:04:45,359 --> 02:04:52,259
so you know which is what is it that

2838
02:04:49,198 --> 02:04:54,719
you're trying to mimic your not so

2839
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:56,880
healthy plants that are outside hitting

2840
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:59,698
a compaction layer

2841
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:01,679
um or may you're going to be building

2842
02:04:59,698 --> 02:05:04,559
structure in that compaction layer so

2843
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:08,099
over the years you're going to be able

2844
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:13,440
to get the root systems of your plants

2845
02:05:08,099 --> 02:05:15,239
down the you know 12 15 feet that we're

2846
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:17,339
hoping for

2847
02:05:15,238 --> 02:05:19,919
um and then you would have to biomimic

2848
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:20,760
it inside your house if you brought

2849
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,779
those

2850
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:23,780
um pots in

2851
02:05:23,939 --> 02:05:28,618
so it sounds like since we you know even

2852
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:31,020
though I really love the idea of

2853
02:05:28,618 --> 02:05:33,000
sketching out this this hanging pots and

2854
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:36,260
and having it go through a tube to a

2855
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:40,618
trough it's it um it sounds like really

2856
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:45,239
folks who want to biomimic soil food web

2857
02:05:40,618 --> 02:05:48,719
their best things to focus will be on

2858
02:05:45,238 --> 02:05:52,019
just ensuring that they have got the

2859
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:53,760
most complex soil and rhizosphere as

2860
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:55,440
possible

2861
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:57,599
um by

2862
02:05:55,439 --> 02:05:59,819
um you know supporting the residents

2863
02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:03,659
that are already there and then

2864
02:05:59,819 --> 02:06:07,618
continuing to inoculate with with imos

2865
02:06:03,658 --> 02:06:10,859
and and such things and just focus on

2866
02:06:07,618 --> 02:06:15,179
the biology of the soil and and call

2867
02:06:10,859 --> 02:06:15,179
that you know good enough yeah

2868
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:21,658
using

2869
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:25,139
the extracts the compost that teas as

2870
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:26,759
needed to try to keep the food web

2871
02:06:25,139 --> 02:06:28,618
balanced

2872
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:32,280
um where you did because one of the

2873
02:06:28,618 --> 02:06:35,098
things you'll discover is what is the

2874
02:06:32,279 --> 02:06:38,880
balance of bacterium fungi for this

2875
02:06:35,099 --> 02:06:42,360
particular cultivar of cannabis which

2876
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:44,099
which one did you buy and uh how much

2877
02:06:42,359 --> 02:06:47,238
difference is there going to be between

2878
02:06:44,099 --> 02:06:49,800
this first species versus a second

2879
02:06:47,238 --> 02:06:53,039
subspecies whatever that's going to be

2880
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:55,500
fun to find out about as well

2881
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:58,139
so um so I've just got two questions

2882
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:59,939
left for you and and and and before we

2883
02:06:58,139 --> 02:07:02,819
go to the final one which is you know

2884
02:06:59,939 --> 02:07:04,379
kind of a delightful philosophical you

2885
02:07:02,819 --> 02:07:06,960
know position for us to end the show

2886
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:10,500
with uh I'd really love you to just give

2887
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:12,539
us your your elevator uh pitch about um

2888
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:15,118
the soil food web school that you

2889
02:07:12,539 --> 02:07:16,738
started because so many of us have been

2890
02:07:15,118 --> 02:07:19,079
accessing

2891
02:07:16,738 --> 02:07:21,118
um you know your education and message

2892
02:07:19,079 --> 02:07:23,760
and insights

2893
02:07:21,118 --> 02:07:26,339
um through you know books and papers and

2894
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:28,679
YouTube uh presentations for these years

2895
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:30,060
but but now you you know you've kind of

2896
02:07:28,679 --> 02:07:32,579
you've kind of taken all of that and

2897
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:37,679
gone pro and made it

2898
02:07:32,579 --> 02:07:41,039
um uh a a a system so that somebody can

2899
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:43,440
work through the entire range of soil

2900
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:45,539
food web ideas and then you know get a

2901
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:46,618
certificate in the end as well so well

2902
02:07:45,539 --> 02:07:49,500
would you just tell us a little bit

2903
02:07:46,618 --> 02:07:52,380
about that before we wrap up

2904
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:55,920
um we what we saw was that

2905
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:59,340
um people learning the techniques and

2906
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:01,920
then going back home and applying them

2907
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:05,279
it's hard for them to do the research

2908
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:08,460
kinds of things we didn't go through

2909
02:08:05,279 --> 02:08:11,340
that of how to figure things out if it's

2910
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:13,679
not exactly the way we we were talking

2911
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:17,279
about it in the classes

2912
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:20,520
so we realized that was we needed to

2913
02:08:17,279 --> 02:08:24,658
start getting our students understanding

2914
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:26,880
that every time we say it depends that

2915
02:08:24,658 --> 02:08:30,059
means they're gonna have to do a little

2916
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:32,118
bit of researching they and we I like

2917
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:34,860
the little containers

2918
02:08:32,118 --> 02:08:38,819
that where we can put in

2919
02:08:34,859 --> 02:08:43,079
you know um let's see six cups of our

2920
02:08:38,819 --> 02:08:48,000
Woody mix uh three cups of our green

2921
02:08:43,079 --> 02:08:51,658
plant material and then one cup of our

2922
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:55,260
um High nitrogen material and you mix

2923
02:08:51,658 --> 02:08:59,098
that all up and make certain that you're

2924
02:08:55,260 --> 02:09:02,820
watering it so you know it's got a nice

2925
02:08:59,099 --> 02:09:05,279
uh amount of moisture in it treat it

2926
02:09:02,819 --> 02:09:07,639
just like you would your larger compost

2927
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:09,300
piles inside the bird cages

2928
02:09:07,639 --> 02:09:12,420
and

2929
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:15,420
watch the temperature is is that really

2930
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:17,340
high nitrogen that you put in is there a

2931
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:20,239
problem where you're not seeing any

2932
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:22,679
bacterial growth and you can

2933
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:23,698
design your

2934
02:09:22,679 --> 02:09:28,920
um

2935
02:09:23,698 --> 02:09:31,138
your compost system uh better but you're

2936
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:33,719
you know you're doing some testing where

2937
02:09:31,139 --> 02:09:35,880
you're trying different materials as

2938
02:09:33,719 --> 02:09:39,840
high nitrogen which is the best high

2939
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:43,920
nitrogen that I've got which is the best

2940
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:46,800
Woody substrate does it matter if I let

2941
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:49,760
that Woody substrate get completely

2942
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:53,219
involved in a bunch of different

2943
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:55,560
fungi and I use that as composed as

2944
02:09:53,219 --> 02:09:57,779
compared to something that was just

2945
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:59,219
ground up

2946
02:09:57,779 --> 02:10:02,039
um you know two or three three months

2947
02:09:59,219 --> 02:10:04,618
ago or something like that uh and so you

2948
02:10:02,039 --> 02:10:09,840
you test for yourself and we're teaching

2949
02:10:04,618 --> 02:10:12,539
our students that way to deal with

2950
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:14,460
questions that you might have

2951
02:10:12,539 --> 02:10:16,679
um and figure it out for yourself now

2952
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:20,279
we'd like to have you all

2953
02:10:16,679 --> 02:10:23,960
um send back in what you discover so we

2954
02:10:20,279 --> 02:10:27,118
can just keep enlarging the the table

2955
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:30,239
about where in the world are you and

2956
02:10:27,118 --> 02:10:34,380
what is the best source of high nitrogen

2957
02:10:30,238 --> 02:10:37,799
the best source of sources of Woody

2958
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:38,460
materials and so on and so forth

2959
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:41,099
um

2960
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:44,698
you know lots of examples that I could

2961
02:10:41,099 --> 02:10:45,900
give but I'll keep going uh it's it

2962
02:10:44,698 --> 02:10:49,678
sounds like

2963
02:10:45,899 --> 02:10:50,879
um uh the the main uh gist or intent I

2964
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:53,819
guess is probably a better word for the

2965
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:56,460
for the soil food web school is so so

2966
02:10:53,819 --> 02:10:58,259
we've we've studied these ideas of the

2967
02:10:56,460 --> 02:11:01,020
soil food web

2968
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:03,179
um you know wrote to memorize them and

2969
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:06,179
what the school does is it it gives you

2970
02:11:03,179 --> 02:11:08,099
the skills to do the research so that

2971
02:11:06,179 --> 02:11:10,679
you can do the processes that you need

2972
02:11:08,099 --> 02:11:13,679
in order to be able to work with soil

2973
02:11:10,679 --> 02:11:15,239
not just like you read it in a textbook

2974
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:17,940
but that you actually have ownership

2975
02:11:15,238 --> 02:11:21,178
over the techniques and the ideas yeah

2976
02:11:17,939 --> 02:11:22,799
right because we we know that every bit

2977
02:11:21,179 --> 02:11:24,599
of a biome

2978
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:26,099
it's not going to be behaving the same

2979
02:11:24,599 --> 02:11:28,739
way especially if you understand

2980
02:11:26,099 --> 02:11:31,199
succession which I just barely started

2981
02:11:28,738 --> 02:11:34,559
going through which you know when you

2982
02:11:31,198 --> 02:11:36,359
look at a watershed and you look at the

2983
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:39,539
fact that up there at the top of the

2984
02:11:36,359 --> 02:11:41,339
mountain is mostly Conifer forest and

2985
02:11:39,539 --> 02:11:42,500
then you've got deciduous forest and

2986
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:45,900
then you've got

2987
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:47,819
the shrubs and bushes and this is

2988
02:11:45,899 --> 02:11:50,819
succession you're you're looking at

2989
02:11:47,819 --> 02:11:53,479
succession so where is your land or

2990
02:11:50,819 --> 02:11:59,039
where is your client's land

2991
02:11:53,479 --> 02:12:04,259
is it down here in the riparian zone is

2992
02:11:59,039 --> 02:12:07,079
it a weedy area that gets Disturbed all

2993
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:10,440
the time by wild and crazy things you

2994
02:12:07,079 --> 02:12:12,899
know go up going up the the slope a

2995
02:12:10,439 --> 02:12:16,919
little bit into Shrubbery and and really

2996
02:12:12,899 --> 02:12:18,539
high good highly productive grasslands

2997
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:20,760
um you have to

2998
02:12:18,539 --> 02:12:22,800
have that microscope to be answering

2999
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:26,880
most of these questions about what's

3000
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:29,760
missing so you can pretty easily start

3001
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:32,400
to build a good Library about here's

3002
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:35,520
what you do when

3003
02:12:32,399 --> 02:12:38,698
blank and if we can have that for the

3004
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:42,119
school so you see what we're doing is

3005
02:12:38,698 --> 02:12:45,319
what are the what are the the things

3006
02:12:42,118 --> 02:12:46,979
that will make it easier and easier

3007
02:12:45,319 --> 02:12:48,078
for

3008
02:12:46,979 --> 02:12:51,718
um

3009
02:12:48,078 --> 02:12:53,399
for students to be successful out in the

3010
02:12:51,719 --> 02:12:55,198
real world yeah it sounds like it's a

3011
02:12:53,399 --> 02:12:57,319
setup for what to do when the answer is

3012
02:12:55,198 --> 02:13:01,078
it depends yeah

3013
02:12:57,319 --> 02:13:03,118
so let's follow this this one so so Dr

3014
02:13:01,078 --> 02:13:05,639
Elaine Ingham you've been an educator

3015
02:13:03,118 --> 02:13:08,279
and an activist actually for soil health

3016
02:13:05,639 --> 02:13:10,199
for decades and it's certainly true that

3017
02:13:08,279 --> 02:13:12,899
regenerative growing techniques have you

3018
02:13:10,198 --> 02:13:15,059
know increased in popularity and the

3019
02:13:12,899 --> 02:13:17,939
generations behind us are are even more

3020
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:20,159
interested than us but also you know the

3021
02:13:17,939 --> 02:13:24,118
fertilizer lobbyists also still have a

3022
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:26,698
strong hold and what advice or Insight

3023
02:13:24,118 --> 02:13:28,799
would you share with those who will

3024
02:13:26,698 --> 02:13:31,379
carry the torch forward in this fight

3025
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:33,659
that that sometimes almost seems

3026
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:37,319
overwhelming

3027
02:13:33,658 --> 02:13:41,219
well it seemed overwhelming to convince

3028
02:13:37,319 --> 02:13:44,519
the world that soil is alive

3029
02:13:41,219 --> 02:13:49,319
45 years ago and yet we've done that

3030
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:52,860
it's amazing once we got over kind of

3031
02:13:49,319 --> 02:13:55,559
the threshold of people accepting that

3032
02:13:52,859 --> 02:13:57,299
it didn't matter what the chemical

3033
02:13:55,560 --> 02:14:01,139
companies were talking about it didn't

3034
02:13:57,300 --> 02:14:03,719
matter that our politicians are in the

3035
02:14:01,139 --> 02:14:04,440
pocket of those people

3036
02:14:03,719 --> 02:14:07,679
um

3037
02:14:04,439 --> 02:14:11,158
when the general public decides it goes

3038
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:15,118
that way and so you know we've got a

3039
02:14:11,158 --> 02:14:17,698
make this as understandable for the

3040
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:21,559
average person that

3041
02:14:17,698 --> 02:14:25,738
they get it and they demand

3042
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:28,380
that their food is grown this way so

3043
02:14:25,738 --> 02:14:29,638
you know we're going to get all of our

3044
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:30,980
nutrients

3045
02:14:29,639 --> 02:14:34,139
from

3046
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:35,519
plants that are cycling nutrients and

3047
02:14:34,139 --> 02:14:37,199
building nutrients and building

3048
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:41,940
protection

3049
02:14:37,198 --> 02:14:43,158
um and that transfers to us the

3050
02:14:41,939 --> 02:14:46,500
the

3051
02:14:43,158 --> 02:14:49,920
microorganisms on the outside of all of

3052
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:52,679
the food that we eat you should be what

3053
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:56,819
Mother Nature put there and not what we

3054
02:14:52,679 --> 02:14:59,639
put put there by spraying pesticides or

3055
02:14:56,819 --> 02:15:01,078
spraying you know for whatever it is

3056
02:14:59,639 --> 02:15:02,060
we're going to go out there and try to

3057
02:15:01,078 --> 02:15:05,399
kill

3058
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:07,739
you don't ever kill if you don't have to

3059
02:15:05,399 --> 02:15:10,138
like I said there's a few exceptions

3060
02:15:07,738 --> 02:15:13,078
like human pathogens yes we do always

3061
02:15:10,139 --> 02:15:16,020
have to kill them but it's going to be

3062
02:15:13,078 --> 02:15:19,859
using a system that is not toxic

3063
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:22,860
chemicals that spread everywhere that

3064
02:15:19,859 --> 02:15:25,139
you know Leech from all of our ecosystem

3065
02:15:22,859 --> 02:15:28,859
of from all of our organic our

3066
02:15:25,139 --> 02:15:31,440
agricultural systems into the water and

3067
02:15:28,859 --> 02:15:33,598
destroys water quality of everything

3068
02:15:31,439 --> 02:15:37,259
Downstream

3069
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:40,260
so we've got to get the reasons for

3070
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:44,699
dealing with landfills that are just

3071
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:48,539
oozing horrible combinations of toxic

3072
02:15:44,698 --> 02:15:52,138
chemicals into the rivers and lakes and

3073
02:15:48,539 --> 02:15:54,960
streams and yeah how's the human how how

3074
02:15:52,139 --> 02:15:57,000
are humans supposed to survive

3075
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:58,800
if

3076
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:02,039
those are the kinds of systems that

3077
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:05,219
we're living in yeah thank you Elaine

3078
02:16:02,039 --> 02:16:07,380
so um so this brings us to our end um Dr

3079
02:16:05,219 --> 02:16:10,500
Elaine Ingham thank you so much for

3080
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:12,659
sharing your time and your expertise

3081
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:14,578
um to join me today here on shaping fire

3082
02:16:12,658 --> 02:16:16,979
but even more so

3083
02:16:14,578 --> 02:16:19,559
um thank you for your long career of of

3084
02:16:16,979 --> 02:16:22,919
research and sharing it and you know

3085
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:24,719
giving a damn and sharing that to

3086
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:26,699
um uh it was absolutely

3087
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:29,340
um you know I've enjoyed hearing you

3088
02:16:26,698 --> 02:16:31,138
talk before but it's been an absolute

3089
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:33,540
joy to have the opportunity to actually

3090
02:16:31,139 --> 02:16:36,420
interact with you thank you so much well

3091
02:16:33,540 --> 02:16:40,760
thank you yeah some great questions and

3092
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:44,159
uh you led me through them in a really

3093
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:45,559
thoughtful and useful way so I hope we

3094
02:16:44,159 --> 02:16:47,218
can do this again

3095
02:16:45,558 --> 02:16:49,558
thank you

3096
02:16:47,218 --> 02:16:51,959
so dear listener if you would like to

3097
02:16:49,558 --> 02:16:54,119
hear more from Dr Elaine Ingham you're

3098
02:16:51,959 --> 02:16:57,299
in luck because she is a guest that

3099
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:59,160
there's a whole bunch online so um I

3100
02:16:57,299 --> 02:17:01,500
recommend you start these three places

3101
02:16:59,159 --> 02:17:04,500
