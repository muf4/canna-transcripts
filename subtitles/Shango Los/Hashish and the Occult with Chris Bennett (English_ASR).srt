1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,910
so Chris thanks so much for taking a

2
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:12,708
little bit time with me I know you're

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,160
busy talking a lot of people because you

4
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:18,618
just spoke last night on on hash and the

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
occult and magic and the nexus between

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:23,000
them all and I got to tell you ever

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,699
since I saw you do your bit on hash

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,899
Church several months ago I'm not like I

9
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:29,240
would really like to meet this guy

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:31,698
because while I haven't researched a lot

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:35,600
into the occult I've read enough about

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:37,939
the OTO and Aleister Crowley and and and

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,829
some of the occult uses of hash that

14
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:41,179
that when you were taught I was picking

15
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,820
up what you're putting down really nice

16
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:46,429
and so I figure I'm probably not the

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,039
only one who has read some of the

18
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,780
Crowley books and would be interested in

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,088
knowing like this little facet of this

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,920
huge research body that you have so I

21
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:56,750
hope that you like like kind of break it

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,570
all down for us the kind of the cross

23
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,948
section of hashish and the occult just

24
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,079
just give us a little good you know

25
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:04,938
probably one of the foremost books in

26
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,250
the Western like originally Western

27
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:09,469
occult tradition is this a 13th century

28
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,478
document the picot Rex it's actually a

29
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:13,789
translation of a 10th century Islamic

30
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:16,250
document the guy at a low key and it has

31
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:18,500
a recipe for invoking the servant of the

32
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,840
moon with over a pound of cannabis resin

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,998
a pound a resident pound of flour yeah

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,560
how to resin yeah mixed with stags

35
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:26,478
blooded some other herbs and then you

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,100
see the spirit and the smoke over it so

37
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,929
it goes that far back and right to the

38
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:32,239
origins of the Western magic the

39
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:35,748
tradition in the 16th century we have

40
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,879
grimoires like the sefar Raziel and the

41
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:39,498
book of Oberon that have recipes for a

42
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,959
cannabis ointment to be used for mirror

43
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:43,368
spray right and you know it's evidence

44
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,618
that John Dee was using the same

45
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:47,390
practice so there was nothing new you

46
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:48,769
know and even before Crowley in the 19th

47
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,049
century figures like Helena Blavatsky

48
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:53,929
who you brought here right she wrote

49
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,569
about her use of hashish and said it she

50
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:59,269
experienced previous lifetimes on it and

51
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:01,189
figures I mentioned in my talk yesterday

52
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:03,319
Beverly Randolph a Rosicrucian that sex

53
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:06,108
magician very influential on Crowley's

54
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,449
OTO and in the hotel itself it's

55
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:11,568
interesting the founder of the OTR

56
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:14,238
Theodore ruse he was actually a opera

57
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:16,609
singer at one time in this opera by

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,840
vogner Richard Wagner called Parsifal

59
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:23,390
and the foremost vogner autobiographer

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,189
who knew a father he says that vogner

61
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,889
was inspired to make the Opera itself

62
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:30,259
after being turned on to Indian hemp

63
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:32,869
extract by Arthur Schopenhauer the

64
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:34,729
famous philosopher right so it's already

65
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,170
kind of an elegant to feel it bubble

66
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:39,078
bubbling you know and so poorly was

67
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:41,809
later initiated into the OTO and became

68
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:44,150
the Grandmaster and they said that

69
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,189
something he had published revealed one

70
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,450
of their great secrets you know and it's

71
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:49,280
interesting because around that same

72
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:52,159
time he'd published on the psychology a

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,430
hashish kind of a scientific essay on

74
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,139
how cannabis was affecting the mind and

75
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,689
I think you know Crowley said it really

76
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,609
well he says you know what hashish is

77
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:04,039
doing is bringing up the subconscious

78
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,980
into the conscious and I think that's

79
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:09,078
really the pivotal aspect of cannabis is

80
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:12,409
role in magic and alchemy and stuff like

81
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:14,359
that um and and and to go deeper on that

82
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:16,489
same point then so are you suggesting

83
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:18,980
that they're like okay we have the hash

84
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:21,409
and it isn't really about let's party

85
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,268
because we're we're wealthy and and we

86
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,250
you know we're in the party class yeah

87
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,650
but they're like no no no no but because

88
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,659
we were a cultists meaning we want to

89
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,789
dive deep into the human psyche and

90
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,829
we're using hashish as a tool cool

91
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:35,179
absolutely you know it was never like it

92
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:36,739
currently made it quite clear he doesn't

93
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,269
think that cannabis alone would bring

94
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,459
somebody to these higher levels of

95
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:43,189
consciousness that it took a good

96
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:46,069
focused amount of work and you know

97
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:49,039
magic was a technique of also doing that

98
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:50,328
in combination with cannabis so and you

99
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,590
want to remember to and a lot of these

100
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,209
instances wasn't these weren't people

101
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,889
that were using cannabis all the time

102
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,960
this was something that was used

103
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:59,719
specifically for Mir

104
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,090
these are ceremony losses yeah yeah yeah

105
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:03,859
ritual magic so they weren't like really

106
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,689
used to the cannabis hi like a lot of

107
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,220
people are today and in some cases you

108
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:08,990
know I was talking about the sarasu and

109
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,139
examples of these guys like are do very

110
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,480
often fish NASPA they were ingesting

111
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:16,488
very potent extracts which is not like

112
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,988
casually smoking a joint with some

113
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,488
friends you know what I mean these type

114
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,139
of potions can they can knock you right

115
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,389
out you know and you can have a full-on

116
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,860
visionary experience well right I think

117
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,560
a lot of people realize that you know we

118
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,310
smoked hash and we smoked flour but back

119
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,290
in these days

120
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,790
people would take balls of hash and you

121
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,379
know the hash eaters right yeah they

122
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,210
would eat hash and at that level it's

123
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:37,339
kind of psychedelic absolutely you know

124
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:39,829
I talked about Louis alpha Hans Cagney

125
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:42,049
yesterday another figure from the 19th

126
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:45,199
century and his book sanctuary of

127
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,720
spiritualism was stories of people

128
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,699
ingesting three grams of hashish and

129
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,919
strong coffee and then they would record

130
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,649
their experiences and these experience

131
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:57,079
are very otherworldly I had never heard

132
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:59,659
of is it called mirror scrying mirrors

133
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,668
crying crying so I had never heard of

134
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,850
that until your talk last night and so

135
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:06,949
am I correct it would be like you you

136
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,360
you would get really high and in touch

137
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,579
with your you know bring up the

138
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,710
unconscious using the hash and then you

139
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:14,839
essentially stare into it until your

140
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,978
mind fills that yeah yeah that's right

141
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,810
yeah that's exactly right same with

142
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:19,339
crystal gazing you know well it's the

143
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,470
wall actually the same technique and

144
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:23,269
John Dee who I mentioned yesterday use

145
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,520
both the blackened mirrors for mirrors

146
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,599
crying and crystal balls so they're kind

147
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,129
of one in the same really but you could

148
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,689
even use like in some of the agent

149
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,819
literature people just stare into a cup

150
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:33,110
you know and any sort of reflective

151
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:35,060
surface you know what I mean it's

152
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,090
something that can give suggestions mind

153
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,629
you play with yeah so I was curious so

154
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:43,459
so were they what we would call dealing

155
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:45,589
where these were they like importing the

156
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:47,089
hash and then also selling over they was

157
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:48,139
that like below them because they were

158
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,549
the higher class so they were just

159
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,120
buying it and they liked it for the

160
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,650
banjo to you probably you know for a big

161
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,540
part of the time he was using it it

162
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:58,159
wasn't illegal so he was using extracts

163
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,660
he was getting through a pharmacist and

164
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,220
there were pharmacist that he was

165
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,630
involved with that we're also it's fine

166
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,490
it's funny to think about golden on

167
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,990
prohibiting of the gold the the the

168
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,280
golden dawn as well as well as his

169
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,410
masculine extracts he was getting them

170
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,389
for part Davis

171
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,010
and you know visited parke-davis and you

172
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,629
know and went to the company and no

173
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,269
person right there and checked out their

174
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:20,170
factory on that type of stuff and in the

175
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:22,089
OTO you know in Martin stars the unknown

176
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:25,150
God which is like a history of the first

177
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:26,799
California Lodge of the OTO guys that

178
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:28,899
are in the in the OTO or growing

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,220
cannabis indica and this is after

180
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,560
prohibition so they were still

181
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,900
continuing to use cannabis you know

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,370
after it had been illegal and grow it

183
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,569
and supply it themselves I know they

184
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,199
knew they had a good thing going that's

185
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,769
for sure

186
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,360
so you know um you know their cocaine

187
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:45,099
certainly comes up in the Crowley book

188
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,949
actually and in retrospect his

189
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,020
reputation is just peppered with you

190
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,490
know no cocaine and the rumors of him

191
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:53,169
eating babies you know people the kind

192
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,560
of trash people talk about Satanists it

193
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:58,330
really that's not really what it's about

194
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,699
was he pretty much just kinda like a

195
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:02,740
freelance do all the drugs kind of guy

196
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:04,029
here's my special place for hash well

197
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,610
you know yeah he had a special place for

198
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,899
cannabis you know he acknowledged in his

199
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,790
writings that he'd struggled with both

200
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:11,289
addiction under cocaine and heroin

201
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,090
particularly which he suffered with

202
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,520
Tellez death you know you got to

203
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:18,039
remember that a lot of heroin use was

204
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,139
medical and Crowley's use of heroin was

205
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,540
often medically prescribed by doctors

206
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,889
they would prescribe for Aspen and other

207
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,680
ailments and stuff like that so he

208
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,810
became addicted through pharmaceutical

209
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,310
use it's not like he was like on the

210
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,470
street heroin right or something like

211
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,689
that he is getting pharmaceutical drugs

212
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,510
and had become a little too accustomed

213
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:39,759
to a sad story Simon Lawrence story to

214
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:41,170
modern story as well right and he really

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,750
struggled with it he wrote about that

216
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,300
struggle he thought that cannabis and

217
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,250
mescaline were particularly the drugs

218
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,189
for loosening the girders of the soul

219
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,220
this is a term he borrowed from the

220
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:56,560
child Ian oracles of Zoroaster

221
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,910
particularly the translation done by dr.

222
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,500
Wynn West got the founder of the

223
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,630
Hermetic order of the Golden Dawn who

224
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,259
also wrote about the use of cannabis for

225
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:07,089
magical purposes so you know he

226
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,269
considered them more magical substances

227
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:10,969
than cocaine or

228
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:12,620
for sure he wasn't down on cocaine but

229
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,500
he made a really good comment one time

230
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,689
about like how you kind of kill a plant

231
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,829
when you extract the active chemical out

232
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,629
of it and he thought there was a big

233
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,490
difference between the coca that

234
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:24,110
somebody would chew him through and you

235
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,240
know run through the mountains then

236
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,520
cocaine which is super process it was a

237
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,340
super process and also between you know

238
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:33,319
raw opium and heroin and he thought that

239
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,939
you know in its natural form with all

240
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,770
its natural alkaloids and stuff like

241
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,110
that the plant was still kind of like a

242
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:41,208
living entity but extracted like that

243
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,219
you'd killed the plan it's kind of like

244
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:47,000
old-school whole plant medicine yeah

245
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,940
yeah so so you

246
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,409
we know they Crowley probably wrote

247
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,970
about hash and then you've mentioned a

248
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:55,490
couple other folks have who have written

249
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,320
about hash are those books you know do

250
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,299
they age well are they are they still

251
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,778
relevant and interesting to read

252
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:04,429
nowadays or do we know so much more that

253
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:06,169
they're they're kinda outdated

254
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:07,909
well cruelly psychology a hashish I

255
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:09,019
think is worth Reedus Peschel e if

256
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:11,689
you're into like yogic meditation

257
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:14,088
because it uses a lot of the states of

258
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,130
consciousness and yoga as an analogy for

259
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,170
the the hashish intoxication of

260
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:20,149
different levels of intoxication so I

261
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:22,909
think that's pretty pretty readable and

262
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,139
there's definitely I would say a growing

263
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:26,629
scene around

264
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:27,919
Crowley and OTO magic right now there

265
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:29,539
seems to be a real renaissance of that

266
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,669
type of stuff maybe due to the

267
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:33,528
popularity of the strange angel tea

268
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:35,629
mysteries you know strange angel based

269
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:38,689
on rocket scientist

270
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:41,208
Jack parson who has a crater named on

271
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,040
him on the moon named after him on the

272
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:45,349
moon he was also a cannabis user wrote

273
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,588
about it you know and refer to it in one

274
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,659
of his poems you know and did masculine

275
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:55,010
in the desert for magic rituals with l

276
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:58,009

into Scientology so yeah a pretty

278
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:02,838
interesting history for sure right on

279
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:04,338
