1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,209
hi it's 10 1.9 fmk bsh our theme today

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,710
has been altered states and the reason

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:11,219
for that or one of the reasons for that

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,400
is that we have dr. ethan russo here to

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:16,528
talk with us about his cannabis travel

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,079
log welcome dr. Russo well thank you

7
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:25,109
it's a pleasure to be here what inspired

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:28,618
you to take off to Morocco and store

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,720
maybe that fisherman would go out at

10
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:34,320
night and they could see better their

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,619
way around duh because they would drink

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,789
a cannabis tincture beforehand and

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,409
apparently he went out with them he

14
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,769
couldn't see anything but they were

15
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:46,049
maneuvering around the reefs on they

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,210
didn't hit anything so he reported this

17
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:50,359
a major and we thought it was

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,829
interesting and should be followed up

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,890
subsequently some years later in a

20
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,350
journal and French I saw an exactly

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,590
similar report from Morocco and it's a

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,939
situation of the Moroccan fishermen

23
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,478
didn't know anything about the Jamaican

24
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,569
fishermen and at that point I decided

25
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:12,090
that this really needed to be researched

26
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:15,359
so I contacted the lead author who was

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,680
after rahman maruti who has joint

28
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,629
professorships in Morocco and Spain and

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,450
said Doug let's try and study this

30
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:27,390
scientifically subsequently a few months

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,280
later I was going to Spain to Granada to

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:37,079
serve on his thesis committee on the

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,750
next year in 2002 we had arranged an

34
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,989
expedition I found some equipment that

35
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,049
could test night vision and so we could

36
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:49,048
test before and after to see if cannabis

37
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,060
did and produce an improvement and that

38
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,630
proved to be the case so subsequently

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,430
were able to publish that and had quite

40
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:00,920
an adventure in Morocco in the meantime

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:04,979
I bet so all right are you saying that

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,500
driving at night is improved if you're

43
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:10,469
high well as with many things there

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,639
could be pros and cons if someone's to

45
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,710
highs they get distracted and they can

46
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,289
drive to slowly so it's a different

47
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:20,219
thing alcohol many people take risks and

48
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:23,590
overestimate their abilities um

49
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,990
unfortunately we established that the

50
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,939
dose of cannabis that's required to

51
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,700
actually improve night vision it's

52
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,740
pretty high and in other words the

53
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:35,409
person who's trying to pursue that

54
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,350
improved vision may be high at the same

55
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:40,299
time so it's unlike some medical effects

56
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:42,759
of cannabis where clearly you can get

57
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:49,390
improvement in pain without the need to

58
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:52,000
be inebriated or have a psychoactive

59
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:53,738
effect would you explain to our

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,330
listeners the differences because I

61
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,159
think that can be confusing for people

62
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,080
there are different properties of

63
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,449
cannabis that serve different purposes

64
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,550
can you explain a little bit about those

65
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:05,579
I think it's THC and I'm not sure the

66
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,930
others so th e is the main psychoactive

67
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,260
ingredient in cannabis but by no means

68
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,390
the only one that's active

69
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:16,539
pharmacologically but it's the one that

70
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:19,238
people know the most about in the past a

71
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:21,789
lot of people relegated the benefits of

72
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,159
cannabis to the idea that people were

73
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:26,828
high and they just felt better um

74
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,150
feeling better is the idea of medicine

75
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:33,310
to my interests but beyond that um it's

76
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,120
been established with modern clinical

77
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:40,079
trials that one can have benefits on

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,269
symptoms like pain muscle tightness

79
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:46,060
nausea even without the need of having

80
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,860
an altered state so this is in contra

81
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,009
distinction of your theme today but

82
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,930
anyway um in other words there may be a

83
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:55,239
sweet spot particularly with certain

84
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,959
kinds of cannabis where one can have the

85
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,969
benefit of symptom reduction without

86
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,400
impairment so that for instance if

87
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:05,709
someone had a chronic medical condition

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,629
needed cannabis for it they could still

89
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:12,250
work or study effectively and what

90
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:15,219
excuse me what is the property in

91
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,988
cannabis other than tht I'm trying to

92
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:19,478
remember the name of it that's 10 can a

93
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:22,269
potato at all perhaps right there are

94
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,269
many other components cannabis has over

95
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,878
500

96
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:28,418
pounds in it um the ones that are best

97
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,160
known or THC tetrahydrocannabinol

98
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:34,810
another that's really coming before in

99
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:38,300
the last few years as cannabidiol or CBD

100
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:41,689
TPD talisman ed is quite distinct from

101
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,389
th seen that it's non intoxicating

102
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:47,569
attends to produce an alertness rather

103
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,550
than sleeping this additionally it's a

104
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:53,210
strong anticonvulsant it's good for

105
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:56,538
epilepsy it's an anti-psychotic too much

106
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:59,598
GC alone can make people feel crazy or

107
00:04:56,538 --> 00:05:02,329
paranoid and that's counteracted by

108
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:05,180
cannabidiol it's not what would be

109
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,589
beneficial for cancer patients who are

110
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,439
going undergoing treatment right

111
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:15,589
actually both are um obviously with THC

112
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:18,408
rate limited by the psycho activity and

113
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:21,698
one needs very very high doses of

114
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:25,430
cannabinoids to primarily treat cancer

115
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:29,419
with CBD don't have this psychoactive

116
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:33,408
side effect problem and so high doses

117
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:35,839
are attainable um but generally speaking

118
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:39,139
for most kinds of tumors both are

119
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:43,848
helpful and a combination may be best so

120
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:47,000
are you saying that kanab and that part

121
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:49,430
of cannabis can actually treat cancer

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,139
not just the symptoms right and what's

123
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,620
unique about the cannabinoids in

124
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:56,930
treating cancer is they are toxic to the

125
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,769
cancer cells while being preservative

126
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,478
for the normal cells so this is quite in

127
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:04,879
contra distinction to conventional

128
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,550
chemotherapy where they're toxic for all

129
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,918
cells and this is why people are

130
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,218
undergoing treatment for cancer may lose

131
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:16,370
their hair on and fluff their gut lining

132
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:18,379
because of this general toxicity so the

133
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,538
approach there is try to kill the tumor

134
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,579
before you kill the patient with

135
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:24,800
cannabinoids we're actually trying to

136
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:27,500
kill the tumor and and keep the other

137
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,520
souls healthy so they're all these side

138
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,468
benefits because both THC and CBD treat

139
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,490
the nausea that's associated with cancer

140
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:37,909
and with chemo

141
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,579
therapy on a simultaneously treat pain

142
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:44,090
improves sleep and so they're all these

143
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:46,370
side benefits if you will to this kind

144
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:48,439
of treatment so why hasn't Western

145
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,379
medicine embrace this treatment for

146
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:56,060
cancer with both arms I'm afraid it's a

147
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:58,250
political issue and people form moral

148
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,639
judgments on what should be a medical

149
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,709
and scientific decision actually other

150
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,720
nations are more advanced than we are in

151
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:08,089
their attitudes about this and I hope

152
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,530
that will change and got to be honest

153
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:16,549
I'm not optimistic right this moment

154
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:18,318
that's another story yeah um you're

155
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,060
going to be making a presentation at the

156
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,020
Vashon theater tomorrow night thursday

157
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:26,149
january nineteen about your trip through

158
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:28,728
your your travel log through morocco in

159
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:31,189
china right what are you going to be

160
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:33,918
telling folks that you learned is it

161
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:36,288
beyond the issue of night vision

162
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,698
improvement oh yeah certainly we're

163
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:40,360
going to have a little bit of scientific

164
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:43,699
aspect like we just discussed with the

165
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,340
night vision but additionally there'll

166
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,669
be some nice photographs and stories

167
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:52,339
hopefully a little bit of humor but I

168
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:55,519
think hope it will be entertaining and

169
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:58,579
educational for people just to mention

170
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:02,750
in China and Shin Jang which is in the

171
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:06,529
Far West very remote area um what

172
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:09,560
happened when that was uh I was in

173
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:12,379
arlington virginia a friend called me to

174
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,680
say you've got to look at this there was

175
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:19,038
an advanced online version of this

176
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:23,598
article saying that they'd found the

177
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:27,079
grave of the Shaiman in Shin Jang along

178
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:30,259
with a huge amount of cannabis and they

179
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,879
were able to identify it and I was

180
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,950
fascinated but what I noticed

181
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,918
immediately was they didn't have a

182
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,599
chemical analysis of the cannabis so I

183
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:41,778
thought this needed to be done I

184
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:45,440
immediately contacted my boss to see if

185
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:47,519
this is something that we could study in

186
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,790
a contact of the lead author

187
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,710
professor of the chiang saen to see if

188
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:55,139
he'd be interested in collaboration and

189
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,600
this all came together within about 20

190
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:59,639
minutes Wow which is miraculous be

191
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,610
happily these are both people that are

192
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,000
heard to reach yeah um but over the

193
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,220
course of the next two years we've got

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,399
we went through 11 months of bureaucracy

195
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:15,210
to get some of the cannabis from China

196
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,549
to England where we did the analyses and

197
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,980
it was so well preserved that we not

198
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:22,559
only did chemical analyses that proved

199
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:26,090
that this was a drug strain of cannabis

200
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:30,389
and not one that was likely used for

201
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:32,100
fabric like hemp additionally the state

202
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:34,500
of preservation was such that we were

203
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,139
able to do a genetic analysis of it

204
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,210
again showing that it was a drug strain

205
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:42,480
and that this would have been used for

206
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:45,750
medical purposes or for properties of

207
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,850
divination by the shame and yeah um and

208
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,909
then I was able to go to Shin Jung and

209
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:55,680
do a field study with our team over

210
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:58,709
there re big the tomb established on

211
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,409
parameters and again have a lot of

212
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,540
adventures associated with that this is

213
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:05,759
fascinating we're talking on the morning

214
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:08,519
scramble with dr. ethan russo who will

215
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,080
be presenting his kind of his travelogue

216
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,529
tomorrow night at the bastion on theatre

217
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,540
what time it is at seven thirty and so

218
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:19,019
I'll probably talk for about 70 minutes

219
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:21,449
and we'll leave about 20 minutes for

220
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,809
questions I have a quick question how

221
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,879
was it preserved well it was a method of

222
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,399
preservation was it just airtight was it

223
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,620
um well did the grave ultimately was

224
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:35,970
likely airtight this is an area that's

225
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,659
extremely arid um and does a cool desert

226
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,860
as part of the extended Gobi Desert

227
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:43,919
additionally the conditions they were

228
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:49,379
very alkaline so between those things

229
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:52,019
the coolness the the alkyl m nature of

230
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:55,889
things of the cannabis was extremely

231
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,350
well preserved on and there was a air

232
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,319
chamber

233
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:03,409
in the tomb on we'll be able to show

234
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,629
pictures of all of the amazing but yeah

235
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:07,549
it was very scientific I the reason we

236
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:10,340
had to read it with tim was i wanted to

237
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:11,959
take the temperature down there and show

238
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,240
that it was cool enough to aid in the

239
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,490
preservation just fascinating where

240
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,190
could people read more about this in

241
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,649
preparation for tomorrow night I wanted

242
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:25,280
to well look at a few you know they'd be

243
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:28,819
welcome to email me that's my name ethan

244
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:32,509
russo he tha in her USS o @ comcast.net

245
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:36,410
on both of these studies about the

246
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:39,350
expedition's were published and so it'd

247
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:40,909
be easiest for them to email me we'll

248
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,620
send them the articles but i hope that

249
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,959
they'd come anyway so that we can see

250
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,230
the pictures well it sounds fascinating

251
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:51,710
i am fascinated by the whole idea of a

252
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,720
chinese shaman using it and how old did

253
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:58,820
you say this jim was odd the ultimate

254
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,100
radiocarbon dating was 2,700 years old

255
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,180
and i would just add this fellow

256
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,009
apparently wasn't ethnic chinese he was

257
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:12,169
a member of what the Chinese called it

258
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:15,559
Gousha tribe on actually this is a

259
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:17,329
Caucasian individual probably a speaker

260
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,659
of an extinct language called till

261
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:23,030
carryin on which most closely resembles

262
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:25,399
the Celtic languages and in their

263
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:29,449
clothing they wore tartan so these were

264
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:31,909
nomads of the desert on it was only at

265
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:35,660
that time that the Chinese were actually

266
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:37,759
first ham in contact with these visitors

267
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:42,409
from the West as it were so we're

268
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:45,549
talking Irish kilt wearing gravy guys

269
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:49,250
going to China and teaching them about

270
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:52,669
cannabis and how to reach God well or

271
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,769
whatever divine or or for a remedy sure

272
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:58,279
well the Chinese had a tradition of

273
00:12:54,769 --> 00:13:00,139
their own of using cannabis but we don't

274
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:04,399
know much about what the exchange of

275
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:07,189
ideas was but eventually

276
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,809
that came to pass it's amazing to me

277
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,000
that you found out as much as you have

278
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:13,789
like through the carbon dating and and

279
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,299
the DNA of the origins of this

280
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:19,069
individual dr. ethan russo you are

281
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:21,559
Evangeline Island resident is a current

282
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,540
that is correct I'm proud to say I'm

283
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:26,239

nine-thirty tickets are only five

296
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,809
dollars which is ridiculously low to see

297
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,009
someone as esteemed as dr. Rizzoli we

298

leave our listeners wind um just uh

316
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:43,100
hopefully that they'd have an open mind

317
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,340
about the medical possibilities for

318
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,019
cannabis treatment and dog again I I

319
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,649
hope that people would be able to make

320
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:53,419
the show and learn a little bit more and

321
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,490
hopefully be entertained for the evening

322
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:58,990
well and before you go the whole the

323
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:01,970
medical prospects of cannabis are

324
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:06,440
intriguing into my mind important for us

325
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:08,720
to know how how can people access this

326
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,760
if it's not currently accepted by

327
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,399
Western medicine or even legal in some

328
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,909
cases i'm not sure i'm so confused about

329
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:19,149
the cannabis laws in the state right now

330
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:21,699
Washington State for access than many

331
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:25,600
other places and again this is an

332
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,490
evolving situation and I would just

333
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,220
encourage people to read as much as they

334
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,620
can get involved politically if they

335
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,300
wish to advance this agenda for the

336
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:39,279
availability of cannabis for medical

337
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:42,189
usage and I would just encourage them to

338
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:47,199
try to pursue that in that we are there

339
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:49,030
any online media information sites that

340
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,830
you could steer people towards to get

341
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:52,240
some general information about what we

342
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:57,220
can do here in the state and what's

343
00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:02,350
available are there many on that come to

00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:08,169

to be excellent now I'm curious about

354
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:30,939
one more thing you are an MD right in

355
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:33,519
Western medicine how is it you continue

356
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,890
to be funded to do these kinds of

357
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,029
research explorations well funding has

358
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:42,519
been a real issue I'll be honest um my

359
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:44,319
prior employment with GW Pharmaceuticals

360
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,730
this is the only independent research

361
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:53,350
project that I was able to do during my

362
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:56,920
11 years there full-time but how I got

363
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,659
into this as yeah I was trained in a

364
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,969
traditional fashion than Western

365
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:02,740
medicine but after seven years in

366
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,920
practice that occurred to me that i was

367
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,809
using increasingly toxic drugs on my

368
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,009
patients with less and less benefit

369
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:14,649
which led me back to an old interest in

370
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:17,440
herbal medicine which i gradually

371
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,350
incorporated in my practice based on

372
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,750
scientific principles and of course that

373
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:27,289
included cannabis which is probably the

374
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,920
herbal herbal remedy parexel off

375
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:31,769
fascinating I think we could talk about

376
