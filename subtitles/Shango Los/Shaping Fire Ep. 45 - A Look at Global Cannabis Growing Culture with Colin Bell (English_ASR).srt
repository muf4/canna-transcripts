00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,240
weed used to be just a local thing it

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,359
was essentially your pot dealer and your

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,798
friends you smoked it with but now that

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,600
the US has taken its boot off everyone's

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:21,118
neck regarding prohibition weed and pot

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,279
has become cannabis and is now a global

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,360
approaches to growing cannabis in

58
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,560
different countries what it's like

59
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,560
trying to evangelize cannabis in

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,318
countries that still have prohibition

61
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,640
and how no matter where you go in the

62
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,878
world cannabis people become fast

63
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,679
friends even if you don't speak the same

64
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,518

some time with us I know that you are a

69
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,079
busy cat and uh watching your Instagram

70
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,199
over the last like 18 months you seem to

71
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,760
you seem to be like traveling everywhere

72
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,560
so I'm glad I caught you in your office

73
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,120
for once so that we could have this

74
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,318
conversation and you know let's let's

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
start right off at the top about like

76
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,799
the different areas of the globe that

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,878
you have been to you know make new

78
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,560
cannabis friends in the in the last year

79
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:53,560
and a half uh I know from watching your

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,080
your Instagram that um you were you were

81
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,439
really interested in how different

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,159
regions of the globe um had different

83
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,039
uh I guess we call them Legacy growing

84
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,120
uh Styles and it was different from

85
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,400
place to place um could you go ahead and

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,519
and tell us a little bit about that

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,760
about how how the growing is done

88
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,519
differently in different parts yeah

89
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,518
absolutely for sure and I want to start

90
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,400
by saying I have an awesome job we have

91
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,640
an awesome company and being the

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,360
co-founder allows me to get a great team

93
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,958
on the ground and then go engage with

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,720
the Cannabis community on a global scale

95
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,319
not only to outreach the business but to

96
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,840
develop our our Global Network you know

97
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:36,759
one of our cultures and and and core

98
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,120
competencies uh and core values is

99
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,798
developing community and we want to do

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
that around the world within this

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,040
industry and that's what I'm getting to

102
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,640
do so it's fascinating and saying that

103
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:51,798
you know we started our Global footprint

104
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,359
uh campaign to get microbes uh used

105
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,799
across the world in this cannabis

106
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,760
industry just a short year ago and we

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,200
have been successful in traveling

108
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:05,719
through UK and many different places in

109
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:07,199
Europe and Israel and Australia and

110
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,359
countries through South

111
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:13,560
America and done the education and

112
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,840
support and brought product our product

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,798
to these countries and and and gotten

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,160
great adoption so it's been quite the

115
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,000
journey and quite the education I have

116
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,520
such a different perspective on the

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
world as I engage people in the world in

118
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,719
these different countries in these

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,680
different cultures within our camp

120
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,639
cannabis community and the growing

121
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,319
Styles as you mentioned are vastly

122
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,439
different from these different areas

123
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:43,279
I'll give the example of our neighbors

124
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,160
in South America as an example there's

125
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,359
some economic constraints to the

126
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,439
products and the technologies that are

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,759
available in some of those countries and

128
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:57,279
just the styles of growing and the

129
00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:00,840
culture of using nature and using soil

130
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:04,279
and being organic and organically

131
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:08,879
oriented I will say has really shaped

132
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:11,959
the way these Growers grow cannabis in

133
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:14,879
South America and Uruguay and Columbia

134
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:18,239
are excellent examples where there

135
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,478
aren't as many inputs used and there's

136
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,759
more natural additives that are being

137
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,519
used and I actually have one of my

138
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,479
partners as an example in Uruguay urugo

139
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,799
Juan what's up my man he did a study

140
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,879
that just blew my mind and this is our

141
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,800
partner our distribution partner in one

142
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,360
of the great strores ugro in mono

143
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,720
Uruguay he did a controlled side by side

144
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,439
using completely organic natural

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,720
substrates in the same room as a

146
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,759
hydroponic system same strain same

147
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,600
climate same light same everything half

148
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,560
the room was hydroponic mineral half the

149
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:58,000
room was organic completely and the same

150
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,800
strain of plants looked completely

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,360
different they tasted completely

152
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,280
different and the mindset through much

153
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
of the much of South America and the

154
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,038
world for that matter now has focused

155
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,439
not only on yield but but maximizing and

156
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:15,120
enhancing the quality of this plant

157
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,360
meaning the smell and the

158
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,360
flavors uh that this plant can give off

159
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,960
there it's Tarpin and flavonoids so how

160
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:27,000
I like to characterize some of those

161
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:30,279
environments is organic and outdoory or

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,560
merging Organics into the indoor grows

163
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:40,439
much more so than in Europe and the UK

164
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,918
where it's heavy mineral heavy Ure to uh

165
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,279
focusing especially in the UK on

166
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:50,318
Strictly deep water culture Hydroponics

167
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:52,638
where Organics are not used and they're

168
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,039
just now the concept of Organics is just

169
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,918
now starting to emerge because of the

170
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,918
acknowledgement of enhanced plant

171
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:04,598
quality when using Organics and that

172
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:07,399
goes for the microbes also and so in

173
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:09,360
South America we can say very open to

174
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:15,679
Organics

175
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:18,080
nature type inputs in Europe in UK and

176
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,439
and even somewhat in Australia where we

177
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,560
do a lot of business the use of microbes

178
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,959
is somewhat

179
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,959
new and it's a process an education

180
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,159
process and that's what I engage in

181
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:35,038
let's let grow Growers understand how we

182
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:38,160
can Bridge natural processes into these

183
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:41,000
conventional mineral uh growing

184
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,879
practices and still enhance not only

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
yields but maximize your plants

186
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,759
phenotypic potential so they can get the

187
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,680
quality that the plant is actually bred

188
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,360
for I I think it's really interesting

189
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,439
that that uh South America would have um

190
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,360
uh such an organic base and and is kind

191
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:05,560
of provides proof of that you can do um

192
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:09,840
Quality organic plantings without a lot

193
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,120
of expensive inputs simply by using uh

194
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:15,519
you know compost teas and local

195
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,598
amendments because you know th those the

196
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,519
people there have not traditionally had

197
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:23,478
the economic wherewithal to be able to

198
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,639
afford the expensive Western fertilizers

199
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:28,719
and then you compare that to the UK

200
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,478
which obviously is is very affluent and

201
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,278
so moved towards Hydroponics and all

202
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,799
these you know mineral-based um bottled

203
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:38,639
nutrients because it it was the thing

204
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,399
right it was the thing that affluent

205
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,559
farmers were using but now you know

206
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,879
people we're kind of having a uh you

207
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,958
know a reconsideration of bottled

208
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,120
nutrients as a as a cannabis community

209
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,799
and and and so the you know folks

210
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,720
throughout Europe are starting to look

211
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:59,199
more towards you know what what people

212
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,639
will often describe as simpler organic

213
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,680
but anybody who's ever studied knf knows

214
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,519
that it can get complex really fast I

215
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,120
think that's interesting how the level

216
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,639
of affluence directly uh impacts the

217
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,159
style of growing I think that's a really

218
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,720
good way to characterize it and it's

219
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:17,159
absolutely true and it's intuitive if

220
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,200
it's been told to you but it was kind of

221
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,360
a surprise as I was I was engaging in

222
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,879
these different areas and these cannabis

223
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,079
Growers and just learning how they're

224
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,759
growing and and the focus on that too

225
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:31,519
Shango I'll tell you um and the UK is a

226
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:35,278
great example I'll call it the Quest for

227
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,360
Quality as ear even a year ago you know

228
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:42,559
the idea was Growers are basically focus

229
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,560
on yield because in the darker uh

230
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,199
colored markets so to speak the black

231
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,759
markets the gray markets I'm not sure if

232
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,879
I love the term Black Market I don't

233
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,159
know why it's a pretty common term but

234
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:56,078
where the regulatory pressure

235
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:58,719
is is more less

236
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,759
developed or what's there's not

237
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,800
regulation and people are kind of

238
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:05,039
working underneath some of the

239
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,479
legalities to get this plant in the

240
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,480
hands of

241
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,879
consumers the plant typically has a

242
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,078
higher value because there's that extra

243
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:19,039
level of risk and people really focus on

244
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,679
yield in those particular markets and

245
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,639
historically that's just been absolutely

246
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,599
true throw everything at the plant that

247
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:29,078
you possibly can to get the yield oh so

248
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,839
like lots of pgrs and stuff oh my

249
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:32,199
goodness

250
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,680
yeah and that's just recently started to

251
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,759
turn around where it was fascinating

252
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,759
this is a good example too when I was at

253
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:41,120
spannabis last year and I'd already

254
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,360
engaged with a lot of growers in the UK

255
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,360
by then for the first quarter of the

256
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
year in 2018 and we're talking about

257
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,480
March 2018 when our team was in Spain

258
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,439
and I was there also a lot of UK Growers

259
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,800
go there also and many came to me at our

260
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,560
booth and they show me these flowers and

261
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:01,000
they were very concerned because they're

262
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:03,679
super dance super Rock hard

263
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,639
and they would ask man do you think this

264
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:09,919
has pgrs in it didn't have any flavor

265
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,879
the smell was off and the concern was

266
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,958
that it's unhealthy and it definitely

267
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,200
wasn't appealing to smoke you know the

268
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,399
the harsh I don't know if you've ever

269
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,720
experienc that where you kind of get the

270
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,278
harsh throat uh yeah unfortunately I

271
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,480
have I do know what you're talking about

272
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,838
yeah I think everyone's experienced that

273
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,600
at least once and the consumers want to

274
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,040
get away from that it's not it's not a

275
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,079
good experience

276
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,078
and this quest for quality not only in

277
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:38,120
terms of uh better growing practices but

278
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:40,120
in the genetics has just skyrocketed in

279
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,078
that market and in other markets through

280
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,399
Europe because of the influence of the

281
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:48,039
US to a large degree um over the last 12

282
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,278
and 24 months and so

283
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:53,599
now everyone obviously still wants to

284
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,559
maximize the yield in their crop but

285
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,000
everyone also really needs to maximize

286
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,559
the quality to distinguish themselves

287
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,519
and and I see that through that quest

288
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:08,078
for Quality through Amsterdam through

289
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:10,399
Spain through UK through

290
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:14,519
Australia what I think is fascinating

291
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:17,759
also is different areas uh have some

292
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,519
kind of endemic I'll say genetic that

293
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,759
seems to persist through all the

294
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,799
different strains Amnesia Hayes is a

295
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,679
perfect example when you engage with

296
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:30,759
with the shops in in Amsterdam and

297
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:33,078
Amsterdam was basically the

298
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:35,159
Cornerstone of the Cannabis industry for

299
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:38,559
a long time in Europe it was very well

300
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:42,120
known it was the center of genetics it

301
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,958
was a center of activity and it's gotten

302
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,720
a lot of criticism recently because the

303
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,599
diversity is not there and that's not my

304
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,360
words it's just the data that I've been

305
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,240
that have I've gathered uh from hearing

306
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,639
a lot of people talk about what they can

307
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,879
get and the genetics um are kind of

308
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,919
constrained and more so through UK and

309
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,320
Amsterdam and Spain and everywhere else

310
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,479
the focus on Colorado and even more so

311
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,040
California

312
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:17,480
genetics is dominates every conversation

313
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:20,120
and it dominates the pricing of flower

314
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,320
also so in many cases through those

315
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,399
different regions if you have California

316
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,560
genetics you can get double the price of

317
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,639
your flow that you can from like

318
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,198
genetics that were just inherent from

319
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,959
those regions wow that's really

320
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:37,399
interesting so so wow so many so many

321
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,638
things to talk about so all right so the

322
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,078
first thing I want to hit on is that

323
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,198
it's interesting because you know

324
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,719
Barney's Farm genetics and such are

325
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:48,159
still remain popular here in the US uh

326
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,759
because they're less common and so those

327
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,120
can sometimes get a a premium price for

328
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,120
European genetics um but you're also

329
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,720
saying that the that the opposite is

330
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,000
also true that our our you know we've

331
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,680
got such talented breeders here in the

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,958
United States that people who have have

333
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:07,399
um stabilized those strains and then

334
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:10,039
they find their way to Europe that's

335
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,440
getting the premium and the another

336
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,759
thing I want to hit on that is you know

337
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,839
you said oh you know a lot of this uh uh

338
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:20,278
let's say demand for bag appeal and

339
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:23,120
tarpine profile instead of just raw

340
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,838
weight raw yield is because of American

341
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,320
influence I bet you that to a large

342
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,160
degree it's because of Instagram too

343
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,480
right because we've all like you know

344
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,319
since we were all kids we've all been

345
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,680
influenced by High Times magazines and

346
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,920
the centerfolds and stuff but clearly

347
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,120
High Times magazine does not have the

348
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:44,039
level of influence compared to you know

349
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,159
Instagram breeders as a whole did you

350
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,838
find that a lot of people were coming up

351
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,679
to you with questions or wanted to show

352
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,160
you things and everybody was going to

353
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:55,919
Instagram profiles back and forth yes

354
00:14:53,159 --> 00:15:00,078
and it's a pretty new thing you know

355
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:02,078
because of the state of the regulat

356
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:06,319
environment in these different countries

357
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:09,000
people are very lowkey in Holland you

358
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,680
know that's changed just recently uh in

359
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,078
the UK people have been lowkey forever

360
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,078
and not very many people until this last

361
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,919
12 to you know within the last two years

362
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:21,679
have really started to even engage in

363
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,599
Instagram but since then it's just the

364
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,399
platform that everyone goes to to

365
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,199
educate themselves on the different

366
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,120
breeders the different strains that are

367
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:32,240
available there's actually a lot of

368
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,039
exchange that occurs on there um this is

369
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,879
kind of a a side note but you know

370
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,159
there's a lot of people that are

371
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:41,679
advertising their flowers on on that

372
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:45,799
platform no doubt about it yeah actually

373
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:47,758
watching uh us Instagram uh uh Heritage

374
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,919
or black market sellers is hysterical

375
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,399
because some people are not even they're

376
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,559
not even trying to be subtle about it um

377
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,919
and it's kind of a it's it's kind of a

378
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,359
fun Pastime to watch those so uh earlier

379
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,318
on you mentioned that you know a lot of

380
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,759
the the technology and uh fertilizers

381
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:09,399
were not available um in South America

382
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,959
and so they were doing it you know down

383
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,600
home organic style the way they've grown

384
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,719
their other food just because they can't

385
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,278
afford the fancy mineral stuff which you

386
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,639
know we're kind of turning away from

387
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,720
anyway but I bet you that also goes in

388
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,639
almost all the countries that you talked

389
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,160
about for analytics right um uh so these

390
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:34,120
people are kind of of like like the

391
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:36,439
United States was 5 years ago before we

392
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,318
had cannabis Labs all over the place and

393
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,120
so these people are kind of breeding and

394
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:43,838
growing and and purchasing blind because

395
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,600
nobody can really tell uh you know

396
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,839
potency and pesticides and pgrs all

397
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,480
these things that that we commonly test

398
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,240
for now um those those just don't exist

399
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,000
everywhere yet yep it's non-existent

400
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,360
it's not required and so there's no cost

401
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,480
that's being there's no investment

402
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,800
that's being put into those verticals

403
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,400
that's absolutely right and it's pretty

404
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,399
fascinating to think about how much

405
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,160
we've evolved and you know we talk about

406
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,919
you know the genetics coming from the US

407
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,279
or why do we know about that because we

408
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,360
can actually collect the data we have

409
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:19,399
the freedom to operate to do proper

410
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:22,159
breeding to do proper testing and to

411
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:26,079
answer those questions with high

412
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:29,400
confidence uh to for for further uh

413
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:32,359
selection of breeding Generations

414
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,320
and how do you know what you're breeding

415
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,479
if you can't test it I don't have the

416
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,399
answer to that I don't think you do know

417
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,240
no and so it's

418
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,280
really not been well informed except for

419
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,240
you know the visuals and you can

420
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,960
actually uh try product afterwards and

421
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,400
see how those plants are responding and

422
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,640
how well you like them but the the level

423
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,798
of confidence for breeding and actually

424
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,919
creating gen genetics has gone way down

425
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:02,158
and and European genetics has has been a

426
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,600
Powerhouse and it just amazed me two

427
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:08,080
years ago when I was introduced uh to

428
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:10,038
the European genetics world I was blown

429
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:13,199
away and you know you can buy three

430
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:15,960
seeds for what $40 I was like what is

431
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,519
going on here talk about the redefining

432
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,159
uh what a money tree looks like just

433
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:26,759
from a genetics perspective but that has

434
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:28,200
quickly uh evolved in the US also and so

435
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:29,720
as Industries evolved one of the

436
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,120
questions I get yet because you know

437
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,720
coming from Colorado and being in the US

438
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,119
and then engaging in all these markets

439
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,519
where legalization is happening and it's

440
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,959
happening pretty quickly but a US is is

441
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,519
leading so I'm like the guy that's

442
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,360
supposed to have this crystal ball that

443
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,079
says you know what does this look like

444
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,399
for us two or three or four years or

445
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,038
what does this look like for us after

446
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,880
legalization happens and and actually I

447
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,480
I can be a resource for uh these folks

448
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,760
in different countries to answer those

449
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,440
questions because there's a pretty high

450
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,240
confidence that we know what it looks

451
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,200
like

452
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:06,839
as growing becomes legal as uh flour and

453
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,759
other THC consumable products become

454
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:12,399
regulated the economics and supply and

455
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:15,038
demand play into effect and it can

456
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,840
affect the whole value chain and so it's

457
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,599
really fun to kind of shed some light uh

458
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,839
and that's another thing that I do often

459
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,519
that's one of the biggest questions I

460
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:25,038
get what does this look like when when

461
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,960
when our country becomes legal and so

462
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,319
one of those questions also and one of

463
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,480
those details is well when regulation

464
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:35,399
happens so does the testing and so it's

465
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:39,240
coming across the board so um you know

466
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,280
when when uh cannabis enthusiasts come

467
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,200
to events um if there's somebody there

468
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,639
that they're all excited to see you know

469
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,038
like a like a major breeder like a mean

470
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,799
Jean or or a celebrity like a Tommy

471
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,400
Chong or a Snoop Dog or something you

472
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,918
know cannabis enthusiasts who are

473
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,960
growing at home they'll bring like you

474
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:00,360
know you know a bag or something of

475
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,720
their best stuff to give to their hero

476
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:06,558
right and and and um I would think that

477
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,480
for you being a uh you know a cannabis

478
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,558
research scientist and an American which

479
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,200
is you know ex kind of exotic in some of

480
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,399
these places and and you're going to

481
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,000
these events some of these people are

482
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,759
are bringing you those bags right

483
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,960
they're they want to show you what they

484
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,919
grew and got your feedback like what is

485
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,120
the range of stuff that that you saw I

486
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,400
mean would were you seeing great stuff

487
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,839
and then like you know crappy pgr Laden

488
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,080
stuff or or uh just just just give us a

489
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,879
snapshot of the kind of stuff that

490
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,000
people are showing you and and actually

491
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,919
probably giving you

492
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,359
too yeah so I love my job I'm just gonna

493
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,880
say and one of the reasons I love my job

494
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,918
is because everywhere I go and this is

495
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,320
kind of a layered question people love

496
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:56,360
to share and to show uh the Wares of

497
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,720
their of their productivity and so I do

498
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:00,558
get gifted a lot of flow across the

499
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,360
world no matter where I mean forget

500
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:06,200
about the states in the UK through Spain

501
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,519
Australia uh Latin America and it's very

502
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,278
different what I will say is that a

503
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,519
little biased because now we've been a

504
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:16,240
company for about three years and

505
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,240
Mammoth uh our our our technology

506
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,440
Mammoth is used in a lot of places and

507
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,558
people are giving me Mammoth grown you

508
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,278
know and so it's it's it's like it's

509
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:26,678
like hey I used your product to grow

510
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:28,679
this and so there's a little bit of a

511
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,600
bias it seems like I'm getting mammoth

512
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,000
own uh product everywhere and and you

513
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,759
know I've probably told you this story

514
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,440
before I can't go anywhere for a week

515
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,359
much less two weeks without having a

516
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,840
huge like a lunch pail full of different

517
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:44,839
Bud from from different Growers at the

518
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,678
at the hydro shops and or the grows that

519
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:49,879
I'm working with and engaging with and

520
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,880
so it's a it's a fun exercise and

521
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,679
regionally it's just completely across

522
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,240
the board different there's a lot of

523
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,000
chronic and chronic inbred strains uh

524
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,240
through Spain because inherently that

525
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,440
strain

526
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:06,319
um is grown in that area the Amnesia hay

527
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,240
stuff is you can taste it in almost

528
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,599
everything growing through the Holland

529
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,919
area there's some different strains that

530
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,798
are just um very very well known the

531
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,799
cheeses is an example of the UK and

532
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:19,359
they're starting to get away from that

533
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:24,519
there's some other strains that are just

534
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:29,558
kind of inherent uh for the Australia

535
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:29,558
Market I've seen probably

536
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:35,599
more

537
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:38,399
organic and probably less potent uh

538
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:41,678
strains the further south we move in the

539
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,038
Americas towards uh South America

540
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,960
through Columbia as an example where

541
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,599
there'll be some expert Growers and PR

542
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,720
an example they had their first Cannabis

543
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:54,439
Cup and as an an an Emerging Market

544
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:00,400
there hasn't been the education and

545
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,400
education is key to maximize

546
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:08,278
the grower knowledge and

547
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:11,240
capabilities to grow high quality

548
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:13,798
strains and so in Peru there's a lot of

549
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,319
room for Growers to improve and there's

550
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:18,759
a lot of room to also get better

551
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:22,079
genetics in there Columbia is another

552
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,759
example where there's not going to be as

553
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,240
high quality

554
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:32,079
generally uh of flour in Columbia as

555
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:34,319
there would be in Colorado or California

556
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,319
I'll say to preface it I had my South

557
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:39,278
American team come up for our holiday

558
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,918
party in sales training in December and

559
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:42,720
we just toured through South America

560
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,400
just before that November and the first

561
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,278
part of December and I took them to some

562
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,679
dispensers into uh a cultivation

563
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:53,119
facility a a commercial cultivation

564
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:56,000
facility in Denver and a dispenser here

565
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,199
in Fort Collins Colorado and it was the

566
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,400
best flower they'd ever seen and the

567
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,720
best flour they had ever smoked and

568
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,320
they've been engaged in the industry

569
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,759
their whole lives and the range of Ages

570
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:10,759
was from 25 to 35 years old a bunch of

571
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,400
young men yeah and most of the time

572
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:17,000
they've engaged in the in the in the

573
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,038
South American markets and so so so two

574
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,400
more things I want to hit on before we

575
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:24,558
uh break for our first commercial um I

576
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,919
want to I want to give you a uh uh an

577
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,639
opportunity to tell the bridal story

578
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,240
which I'm sure that you you're getting

579
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,440
and then and then after that would you

580
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,000
go into the the we haven't hit on Asia

581
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,919
yet and you've got some interesting

582
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,679
stuff to say about Asian growing co-ops

583
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:46,000
yeah yeah so for sure so I guess I'm I'm

584
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:48,159
honored to be again able to engage uh

585
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,599
professionally in what I do which is

586
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,360
just engage with Growers trying to bring

587
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,158
them value and what I get everywhere I

588
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:56,759
go it's a lot of hugs and I love that

589
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,760
too uh and and one of the shows we were

590
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,440
at in Columbia in Med Jean a young man

591
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,398
and having you know talking to him

592
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,919
someone on Instagram Etc and he had some

593
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:08,439
product and he was a grower and he was

594
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:11,000
using Mammoth and and it was a really uh

595
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,600
Charming story where he told me he felt

596
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
like our product after he started using

597
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,439
it he felt like his plants uh were

598
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,079
getting married because they got so

599
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,558
Frosty that was like they were putting

600
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,879
on a nice white wedding gown uh so just

601
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:27,678
it goes to show to the increased quality

602
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,159
that he was experiencing with the same

603
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,038
strength he's been grown for a long time

604
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,919
just by incorporating our microbial

605
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:37,319
Technologies to enhance uh nutrient

606
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,440
uptake and even that example right that

607
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,398
that's such a culturally relevant

608
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,320
example that's not that's that's

609
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:45,798
probably not something that you'd get

610
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:49,639
from an American right that if you know

611
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:51,278
in in in you know South America where I

612
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,759
don't know the whole kind of wedding

613
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,440
culture is more integrated I don't know

614
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,640
differently than here um I think that is

615
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,798
a it's it's very poet

616
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,720
it was very poetic it moved me and uh I

617
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,918
I like to tell that story it's just a

618
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,200
really cool thing and and the thing is

619
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:11,320
as you know too everyone is so

620
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,919
passionate in this industry and if you

621
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:16,079
can help someone especially in this

622
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,080
industry you've just made a friend for

623
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:22,439
life and all we do is try to create

624
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:25,240
value and and provide solutions for

625
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,880
cabis Growers that's 100% of our focus

626
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,440
and I love being able to do that and in

627
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,320
doing so you know we're just we're just

628
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,640
creating friends all over the world we

629
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,278
love it so let's finish up first Set uh

630
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,759
break us down a little bit about uh

631
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,798
Asian growing Co growing co-ops and

632
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,798
recipes yeah so this is something that

633
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:47,319
was new too and as you can imagine I was

634
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,679
first really exposed to this in the UK

635
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,678
and as I move to Europe and Australia in

636
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,919
particular it's apparent that there's

637
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,480
different uh cultural groups that move

638
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,880
into areas uh to dominate the black

639
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,720
market there's uh as Asian groups

640
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,760
there's Russian groups there's Armenian

641
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,600
groups there's polish groups and

642
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:08,158
depending on who has this stronghold

643
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:10,158
it's kind of a an organized situation uh

644
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,520
they take chunks of the market to

645
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,120
control it and there's uh Asian

646
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,398
Vietnamese groups that have done this

647
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,479
for years and have been very successful

648
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:22,278
and they've developed and what I

649
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,319
understand is there's main families that

650
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:27,519
kind of

651
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:29,278
control the the global Asian growing

652
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:34,319
throughout the world world where they

653
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:37,119
have families in Canada and in UK and in

654
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,319
Australia and it's a very interesting

655
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,879
and a very hard nut to crack to actually

656
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:43,519
get them to adopt because there's many

657
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,840
many different grows that one family

658
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,240
might control and there's one recipe

659
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,798
that they all have to follow and so

660
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,440
there's a language barrier they go to a

661
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,200
certain amount of stores where there's a

662
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,399
language barrier they only deal with

663
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,919
their own kind and for me to try and get

664
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:01,079
in and learn more about this growing

665
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,880
it's been pretty intensive but what

666
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:06,439
happens is they follow the same recipe

667
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,200
they don't ask questions and in order to

668
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,720
get on that list has been quite the

669
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,360
challenge and so these main families

670
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,200
especially in Australia have

671
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,599
acknowledged uh our efforts in trying to

672
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,558
allow uh to bring these Technologies our

673
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:23,480
technology to get better yield and

674
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,240
better quality which is typically known

675
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,200
as especially in Australia they call it

676
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,519
the brown which is like hit with every

677
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,038
pgr known to mankind it's what the T

678
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:33,278
it's what the tourists buy and you know

679
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,798
all the locals are like don't get the

680
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:38,440
brown don't get the brown mate and and

681
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,440
the some of these Asian groups have

682
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,399
picked up Mammoth because it allows them

683
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,480
to get away from that stigma of the

684
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,479
brown and to improve the quality of

685
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,880
their grows and so just the just the

686
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,159
structure of how different groups are

687
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,399
growing and where they're organized and

688
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,399
located has been quite the education I

689
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:00,759
love the idea of these vertically

690
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:02,359
integrated Asian growing co-ops that

691
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:05,000
have

692
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:08,839
got Loosely I'll say family but they've

693
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,679
got these these vertical families set up

694
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:14,480
um and and if if you're part of this

695
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,600
growing vertical you use the same

696
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,599
recipes as everybody else in the clan

697
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,759
and um it's kind of like a cultural

698
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:24,480
franchise you know it's like it's like

699
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:26,480
your whole family you've got all these

700
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,839
different locations but you're all doing

701
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,038
it the same way because it's what you've

702
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:34,918
decided uh works and decreases your

703
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,798
growing risk the most and the idea that

704
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,000
they've they've got something like that

705
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,798
without formal contracts that's just the

706
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
way it's always done I find that very

707
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,759
culturally interesting yep and it's

708
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,200
actually a very important to understand

709
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,919
that from a manufacturer standpoint uh

710
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,519
and it goes down to the very unique

711
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:57,038
detail of even packaging they get uh a

712
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,599
blueprint of what the bottle looks like

713
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,000
and that's the color bottle they're

714
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:02,199
going to buy with the color label and

715
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,599
the color caps and there's been cases

716
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,880
when I've known without say going into

717
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:08,839
names a manufacturer that decided to

718
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,760
change the color of their caps their you

719
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:15,199
know their closures to Blue where it was

720
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,960
white and they had to stop the the

721
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,759
grower stopped buying it because they

722
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,399
were supposed to buy that product that

723
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:24,679
had the White Caps not the blue caps and

724
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:27,439
you can't get it through to them so not

725
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:29,960
to manufacturers out there packaging

726
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,600
matters don't change packaging if you

727
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,798
don't have to it can cause more problems

728
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,719
than bring

729
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:39,720
value good good argument to uh take more

730
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,120
time uh uh developing your packaging at

731
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,600
the beginning so you don't have to make

732
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:47,199
a change at the end of year one exactly

733
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,959
for sure right on cool well this is all

734

a further step and selfs all these

825
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,440
kimars so you know all the seeds will be

826
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,440
female these are not experimental

827
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,358
feminized seeds humble CSI releases some

828
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,320
of the best female seeds available

829
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,398
anywhere and it will show in your garden

830
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,639
folks grew quite a bit of CSI humble

831
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,319
Genex last year here on Vashon Island

832
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,760
and everyone was pleased

833
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,359
the patients had beautiful female plans

834
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,879
and didn't have to call half of their

835
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:37,039
Garden as males the folks growing for

836
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,199
the fun of getting high grew colorful

837
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,960
flowers with exceptional bag appeal and

838
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:44,118
great highs and breeders had seven out

839
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,000
of seven females in a pack which gave

840
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,720
them a lot of phenotypic choices take a

along with photos and descriptions

845
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,400
that's humble

846
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:03,919
csi.com welcome back you're listening to

847
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,760
shaping fire I'm your host Shango Los

848
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,200
and our guest this week is Colin Bell

849
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,720
co-founder of Mammoth microbes so during

850
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:13,118
the first set we talked a lot about um

851
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,879
the differences in growing techniques

852
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,440
and culture um across Europe and

853
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,039
Australia and Latin America and Asia

854
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,320
well a lot of what you have been doing

855
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:26,880
during the last year and a half Colin is

856
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:29,000
essentially evangelizing living soil um

857
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,000
you know the same changes that have been

858
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,039
happening in the US as prohibition

859
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,559
starts to recede people are able to talk

860
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:40,400
more online we're being able to visit

861
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:43,358
analytics labs to learn you know people

862
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,800
are starting to to rely on synthetics

863
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,199
less and essentially your job when you

864
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,680
went over there was to meet people and

865
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:53,199
create community and kind of encourage

866
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,318
people to use soil more and to stop

867
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,879
putting pgrs and chemicals in their

868
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:00,039
stuff just for their own health can you

869
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,160
tell me a little bit about you know what

870
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:06,279
it's like to encourage people to

871
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:08,000
essentially start over on a new kind of

872
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,880
growing technique I mean you told us in

873
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
the first set that that uh Europe was

874
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,039
very much well especially the UK were

875
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,159
very much into Hydroponics and you're

876
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,440
like no I think maybe you should you

877
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:20,159
know get rid of everything that you've

878
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,280
done up to this point and start in this

879
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:26,879
you know in this new way how did people

880
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,640
react to your your message as a as a

881
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,920
living soil

882
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,719
evangelist I will start by saying you

883
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,559
know I have a PhD in microbiology and I

884
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,279
feel like I've been a living Soul

885
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,159
evangelist for my whole life at least my

886
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,240
whole academic career I just wasn't a

887
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:43,879
very good one until I was able to

888
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:46,239
actually apply some of my academic

889
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,800
training uh into the market where I

890
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:55,719
could engage Farmers more and yes of

891
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:58,359
course we know and science has well um

892
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:00,679
supported that the

893
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:03,318
natural processes that occur in soil

894
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,838
that are facilitated by soil microbes

895
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:08,079
both bacteria and

896
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:10,960
fungi do support plant Health plant

897
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,560
development and plant yield no questions

898
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,880
asked we also know that the interactions

899
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:21,119
between chemistry and cultivation

900
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,800
although we do deliver nutrients to

901
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,800
plants using chemical fertilizers and

902
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,280
they're in layoff forms we are missing

903
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,920
something and we know that whenever we

904
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,119
can incorporate some of the nature back

905
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,119
into the rizosphere or the plant root

906
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,640
Zone and nurture those exchanges those

907
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:44,280
plant microbial exchanges that have

908
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:46,759
evolved since the beginning of time the

909
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,800
plants respond to it favorably I feel

910
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,480
like we bring the natural exchange back

911
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:57,519
to them to allow them to maximize their

912
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:00,920
potential I'll also say that I've talked

913
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:04,440
to hundreds and hundreds of farmers in

914
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:07,440
many crops and Farmers don't like to

915
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,838
change anything no matter what they're

916
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,920
farming and so that is quite a steep

917
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:15,759
hill to climb and thinking about that we

918
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,760
have to understand how to bridge the gap

919
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,119
of nature or natural

920
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,880
Technologies like using microbes like

921
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:26,920
using living soil into existing

922
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,680
management practices without having to

923
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,838
ask the farmor to change everything

924
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,318
because that could be a very long

925
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:37,480
adoption

926
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:39,239
cycle and so so when you approach them

927
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,679
what are you finding and I and I know

928
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,479
I'm trying I'm about to take your entire

929
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,519
Global Experience from the last two

930
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,119
years and and and bring it down to one

931
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,920
example but generally speaking when when

932
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,318
you meet these people are they hungry

933
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,800
for the new organic knowledge where

934
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:56,838
they're they're all like you know

935
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,960
explain it to me five ways so that I can

936
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:03,440
understand it in my language or are they

937
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,000
you know you are a farming colonist you

938
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,838
know and and you're you're trying to

939
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,838
change our ways for no good reason I

940
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,440
think that I approach it a little

941
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,480
differently and it's practically too

942
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,240
what I focus on is the value and then

943
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,400
then you talk about how to get the value

944
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:23,118
you know every farmer is looking for

945
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,720
Solutions they're all looking to enhance

946
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,039
if it's food nutritional quality of the

947
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:31,919
food and yield if it's cannabis it's the

948
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,960
quality of the Cannabis and the yield

949
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,039
everyone wants that and if you can

950
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,559
improve that you have an audience the

951
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,920
next question is how and so it's the job

952
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:48,159
of Manufacturers like myself and many

953
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:50,639
others to bridge the needs of farmers

954
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,559
with a technology that's readily

955
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,799
adoptable I think there's a lot of great

956
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,799
te Technologies out there that if it

957
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,119
doesn't have that adoption that easily

958
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,480
adoptable characteristic it's not going

959
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,240
to be successful in the market because

960
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,159
it's just a huge barrier and so as an

961
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:11,879
example and this is uh probably the

962
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:14,039
biggest push back we've had is in the UK

963
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,680
early on and and just so you know we

964
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,480
have awesome adoption with our

965
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:21,039
technology in the UK which is a huge

966
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,639
Testament to how well microbes work

967
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,480
across a wide range of management

968
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,159
practices cultivation practices and

969
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,199
cannabis we got the best new product of

970
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:32,838
the year in late 2017 it's an amazing

971
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:34,799
success story but with the hydroponic

972
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:38,279
Growers who

973
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,839
use sterile techniques where they pour

974
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,400
bleach or they pour hydrogen peroxide

975
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:47,159
into the reses regularly to kill all the

976
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,639
micro life and mostly to control

977
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,598
pathogens uh that's why they do it and

978
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:55,679
that's a huge pain point and so how can

979
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,760
I educate those Growers who know they're

980
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,440
pouring in uh

981
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,319
disinfectants Things That Kill microbes

982
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:07,079
into their Grove to use

983
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:09,960
microbes well you educate on ecology and

984
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:12,880
let them know that plants have evolved

985
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:16,639
with microbes and microbes do benefit

986
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,480
plant growth and what we're trying to do

987
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:22,239
is mitigate pathogens but we're not

988
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,358
trying to kill beneficials and so from

989
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,919
an ecological perspective you can start

990
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:30,480
to educate on ecological nich Theory

991
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,838
competition Theory where if you can

992
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,079
flood root zones with beneficial

993
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:40,119
microbes bacteria and fungi it actually

994
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:41,800
in some ways these microbes act as a

995
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:45,039
bioshield

996
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,560
blocking pathogens and blocking

997
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:50,920
potential infection sites to limit

998
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:53,119
pathogen infection and that's one angle

999
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,838
along with the fact that if you can

1000
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,039
maximize absorption of nutrients for

1001
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,318
plants using these natural microbial

1002
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:04,719
Solutions which is synonymous with a

1003
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:07,358
living soil Bridging the Gap starting to

1004
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,959
acknowledge that at least components of

1005
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:13,159
living soil can be applied across all

1006
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,280
cultivation practices you get people

1007
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:17,199
thinking and you can get samples in

1008
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,200
their hands and they have to see the

1009
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:23,000
results every farmer wants to see

1010
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:25,480
results with products they adopt with

1011
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,960
products they're trying and if there's a

1012
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:32,358
positive result you have just won over a

1013
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,559
customer and they're going to buy your

1014
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:36,639
technology because they want those

1015
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,640
Solutions and not only that but they'll

1016
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,039
tell all of their friends right because

1017
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:44,440
no one keeps quiet when they've just

1018
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:48,400
grown their best flowers ever right

1019
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,280
everyone tells everybody I do I do I I

1020
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,559
want everyone to know and you know

1021
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,599
Shango that goes even for let's talk

1022
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,440
about we're talking about cannabis but

1023
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,720
think about home tomato Growers there's

1024
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,960
a lot of really Avid not to change the

1025
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:03,598
subject Avid tomato Growers and I'll

1026
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,000
tell you what when I used to when I was

1027
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,838
younger and I used to grow these big

1028
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,280
tomatoes and they were delicious and

1029
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:10,519
huge I would go show all my neighbors if

1030
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,760
they look you know because you're kind

1031
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:14,318
of racing with all your neighbors to get

1032
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,880
the first tomatoes and get the best

1033
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:17,400
tomatoes and get the biggest tomatoes

1034
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,559
and it's no different with cannabis or

1035
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,880
any other crop people get excited about

1036
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,720
their achievements and they want to

1037
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,000
share their achievements and in this

1038
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:28,799
industry we want to share our success

1039
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,800
and we should share success and so

1040
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,559
that's exactly right if you have great

1041
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,559
results you want to share it and that's

1042
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,920
one thing that's very exciting we were

1043
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,240
talking about social media but in

1044
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,079
general you know if you have something

1045
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:45,879
that works it will get out there as a

1046
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,680
model we feel like everyone should try a

1047
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,800
sample of our technology as just as an

1048
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:52,558
example because we feel like you'll have

1049
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,559
a good result and if you have a good

1050
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,160
result that means we're bringing value

1051
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:59,920
to Growers and we're going to be

1052
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:02,118
successful as a company and that's kind

1053
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,599
of how it works I think it's really

1054
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:07,599
great how you pointed out that no matter

1055
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:10,960
where you traveled even if people were

1056
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,760
looking for new and better growing

1057
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,599
information that everyone was proud of

1058
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,400
growing cannabis and that they were

1059
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,640
proud of the Cannabis they were growing

1060
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,519
I like that as being a universal that

1061
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,159
that no matter where we are no matter

1062
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:27,199
what we can what kind of inputs we can

1063
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:28,879
afford whether or not we have to do it

1064
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:30,719
in the basement because of prohibition

1065
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,318
or whether or not we can grow outside

1066
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,959
because there's Medical in the country

1067
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:37,960
um the idea that everybody is engaging

1068
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,480
with the cannabis plant and it's making

1069
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,318
them feel good I think that is a

1070
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,400
wonderful Universal for our cannabis

1071
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:49,239
Community there are way

1072
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,880
more similarities across the world

1073
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:55,199
within our industry than differences if

1074
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:58,240
I engage any Cannabis Conference or any

1075
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:01,358
group of cannabis Growers I could have

1076
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,719
the same exchanges with groups that I

1077
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,199
meet in

1078
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:10,239
Colombia and groups that I meet in Spain

1079
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:14,679
or Australia or the us or the UK or

1080
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:17,558
Israel we all have the same passion for

1081
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:22,039
this plant and for this industry and

1082
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:25,200
it's uh a similarity that the world

1083
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:27,318
within this industry shares for sure and

1084
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,039
I'll give you an example that you just

1085
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:32,119
kind of hit on this is last time I was

1086
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:34,000
in Australia we were in Perth which is

1087
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,880
one of the most isolated cities in the

1088
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,039
world very very cool and cannabis is

1089
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,920
very illegal and we're going and

1090
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:43,719
engaging in the hydroponic grow shops

1091
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,599
and one of the last ones and one of the

1092
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:49,799
very last days I was there for a 10-day

1093
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:52,400
stretch last October and I met a guy who

1094
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,039
was super cool older guy he' been

1095
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,639
growing there forever you know everyone

1096
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,800
keeps it on the the DL man you have to

1097
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:01,759
be very discreet and it's not like

1098
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,359
you're taking selfies and Instagram

1099
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,119
pictures with these people you can't do

1100
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:07,799
that you can't take pictures in these

1101
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:11,000
stores because they don't want their

1102
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,680
faces shown it's a it's kind of a risk

1103
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,440
but this gentleman I started talking to

1104
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:16,399
him talking about the technology he got

1105
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,480
super excited obviously I gave him some

1106
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,960
samples and he was like man you've got

1107
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,000
to see what I'm doing and he lived an

1108
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,240
hour away and he was like can you please

1109
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,960
wait for me here I really want to give

1110
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:28,679
you a gift you know you're from the

1111
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,318
States and you're doing this I'm really

1112
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:32,000
happy and you know it was just ecstatic

1113
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:33,800
I'm like I'll wait for you of course I

1114
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,079
waited there 2 hours hung out you know

1115
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,599
had a great time it's fun hanging out

1116
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:40,480
the hyro shops I really love those

1117
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:43,039
stores and he came back and gave me

1118
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,440
handfuls of four different strains of

1119
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,318
amazing cannabis that he'd been you know

1120
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,599
nurturing and growing and breeding for

1121
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:51,838
years it's just a testament man he went

1122
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,599
two hours basically out of his way to

1123
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:57,799
share to gift to be kind and I'll never

1124
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,838
forget it that's really great and you

1125
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:04,000
know I can the idea of going back to not

1126
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:06,119
being able to show you know faces on

1127
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,239
social media around flowers it's like oh

1128
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,400
my gosh what a you know what a what a

1129
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:14,000
jump back to you know seven eight years

1130
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,400
ago and at the same time I'm thinking of

1131
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
how many people who are listening to the

1132
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,519
show right now who are in states in the

1133
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,400
US that that's still the reality you

1134
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:27,759
know I I'm I'm very fortunate to live on

1135
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,599
the west coast and in Washington and and

1136
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,680
to have been able to participate in all

1137
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,160
of this so early um but you know

1138
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:37,480
thinking about these you know uh you

1139
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:40,358
know your story in Perth that could just

1140
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,318
as well be be some of the places here so

1141
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:45,679
so to everybody who's listening in a

1142
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:48,159
Prohibition State hang in there folks

1143
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:50,960
we'll we'll we'll we'll make our way to

1144
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:53,519
you soon enough um change is coming yeah

1145

change is coming so um one more thing I

1146
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,559
want to hit on on on the evangelizing

1147
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:01,519
you know um how much challenge did you

1148
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,000
have with language right I mean the the

1149
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,079
flower itself and the smoking of It kind

1150
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,838
of transcends language you know you get

1151
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,119
together people everybody knows how to

1152
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:11,838
how a joint works and if you just like

1153
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:15,160
Pass the Joint around a circle and

1154
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:17,199
everybody smiles and laughs and you know

1155
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,960
you know some amount of broken English

1156
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:21,000
uh can work and I don't know what

1157
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,639
languages you speak but but you know

1158
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,440
what was it like for you to talk to

1159
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:27,719
people in so many different countries

1160
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,679
with so many different languages

1161
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:31,959
I think talking and communicating are

1162
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:33,719
two different things I don't I don't

1163
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,720
speak Spanish well and that's one of my

1164
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:40,039
goals for 2019 it was a goal for 2018

1165
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:41,838
and I just traveled so much and it was

1166
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:43,679
in so many different places obviously

1167
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,519
there was it made it hard for me to to

1168
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:49,838
hunker down and and be a good student to

1169
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:52,280
learn the language I do have great uh

1170
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,239
Spanish-speaking Partners through Mexico

1171
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,839
and South America and in Spain and they

1172
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,439
helped me a lot no doubt about it but

1173
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:00,159
there's a body language and there's a

1174
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,880
you know how what what does a hug mean

1175
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,759
to you I don't have to say anything to

1176
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,720
know exactly what that means pass me a

1177
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,559
joint and give me a

1178
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:11,719
hug that happens everywhere you know and

1179
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:15,280
the and a smile and the look of man this

1180
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:16,759
is awesome and a headshake and of course

1181
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,720
we communicate we do a lot of

1182
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,319
communication I communicate with many

1183
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:23,318
people on Instagram and direct messaging

1184
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:24,558
and and emails to a lesser degree now

1185
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:26,119
thank goodness I'm trying to get away

1186
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,920
from the emails completely one of these

1187
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:31,559
days that's probably my 2019 goal also

1188
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,400
um and the WhatsApp is another wonderful

1189
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:38,640
tool that everyone around the world uses

1190
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,760
that in itself allows me if I can't

1191
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,838
understand every word even through

1192
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,520
Reading I can translate it and engage

1193
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,759
and understand the messages and

1194
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:48,440
translate it back and and and and

1195
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,280
communicate so I think communication is

1196
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:53,159
just the effort you put into it and I

1197
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,839
put everything I have into communicating

1198
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:57,399
it's so important to me right on hey

1199
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,039
let's go ahead and take our second uh

1200
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,838
short break and be right back um you are

houses is taking over the Cannabis

1206
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:14,078
industry an efficient and effective

1207
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:16,279
blend of sunshine grown turpine profiles

1208
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,119
and the controlled environment of indoor

1209
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,480
green houses can be the best of both

1210
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,599
worlds for many Greenhouse operators

1211
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,960
though building their Greenhouse before

1212
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:27,079
gaining insight into how cannabis green

1213
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,920
houses differ from ornamental crops can

1214
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:32,000
be the start of a world of hurt Eric

helping cannabis Growers find locations

1220

design build and equip their green

1221
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,640
houses for over a decade first starting

1222
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:49,759
in Northern California but expanding

1223
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:51,400

1228
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,400
challenges facing cannabis green houses

1229
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,960
and how to overcome them in episode

1230
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,240
number 41 of the shaping fire

1231
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,400
podcast no matter where I go in the

1232
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:11,479
country good people with smart

1233
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,039
backgrounds still are making the mistake

1234
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,880
of building without knowing cannabis and

1235
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:18,759
it causes them to burn through capital

1236
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,200
and time fast everyone has their own

1237
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,119
failure point for some it is improper

1238
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:24,879
ventilation planning for others it is

1239
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,440
surface temperatures of the building or

1240
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,880
the plants leaves or both some folks

1241
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,920
that build their Greenhouse from scratch

1242
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,240
make really basic errors like placement

1243
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,599
of the greenhouse on the property or not

1244
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:36,838
understanding the natural environment

1245
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,798
where the greenhouse sits some have even

1246
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:40,599
built a decent Greenhouse but are

1247
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:42,639
inefficient in their deployment of light

1248
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,000
deprivation techniques and never really

1249
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,279
hit their target

1250
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,119
yields it's great when you learn from

1251
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,240
your mistakes but it's even better when

1252
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:52,358
you learn from the mistakes of others

1253
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:54,118
when you bring on Greenhouse Advisory

1254
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:56,159

working with clients just like you from

1259
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,880
location development to choosing a

1260

builder and tricking out your new

Advisory

1267
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,599
Group now that the health benefits of

1268
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:26,798
tpin have become well known in the

1269
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,798
Cannabis industry people everywhere are

1270
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:31,039
looking for the purest tpin without

1271
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:32,719
adulterant the problem with most tpine

1272
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,480
providers is that they're not sourced

1273
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,679
naturally and instead are made as a

1274
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,199
byproduct of refining petroleum and

1275
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:41,480
that's so sketchy the Tarpin sold by

1276
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:44,318
true tpin are entirely different they

1277
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,159
are certified organic non-GMO and food

1278
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,558
grade that means that they are extracted

1279
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,759
from real plant sources there are no

1280
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,920
solvents of any kind they are distilled

1281
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,559
only with steam that's right only steam

1282
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,798
in fact turpins from True turpins are so

1283
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,160
here that you can eat them not only that

1284
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:02,639
but you can stack them with better

1285
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,879
results too what I mean is other

1286
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,199
companies tpin have got a few percent of

1287
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,079
impurities and when you stack those tpin

1288
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,039
to make your blend you're adding a

1289
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:13,720
variety of impurities that degrade your

1290
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,838
final product true turpins also have

1291
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:18,159

1316
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,519
I'm your host Shango Los and our guest

1317
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,599
this week is Colin Bell co-founder of

1318
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:20,519
Mammoth microbes so before the break

1319
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:23,000
Colin we were talking about how some

1320
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:25,280
people that you met didn't want to take

1321
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,760
selfies with you because they are in

1322
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:31,160
prohibition country still and and they

1323
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:34,720
can't have their face and name attached

1324
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:36,920
to their cannabis enthusiasm um I'm

1325
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:39,519
curious what other things that you

1326
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:41,039
experienced around like prohibition

1327
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,639
Vibes because a lot of these countries

1328
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:46,440
that you've gone to are still very much

1329
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:50,078
early in the transition towards even

1330
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:53,200
medical before even getting to adult use

1331
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,519
and um and and taboo is in the air and

1332
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,480
potentially danger so so what do you

1333
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:01,480
have to share about what it was like to

1334
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,599
to be in prohibit prohibition countries

1335
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,318
yeah so you know it's actually very

1336
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,400
exciting in some ways I'm a scientist

1337
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:10,798
that came from the University and now

1338
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,798
I'm navigating in this cannabis industry

1339
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,798
which is I would say regulatory wise

1340
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:17,318
dark great of black markets yeah

1341
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:19,480
throughout the world and with that comes

1342
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:21,679
a level of risk you know going from

1343
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,199
country to Country engaging in this

1344
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:27,358
industry you have to be very discreet

1345
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:28,919
and to uh what I what I think is really

1346
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:33,358
important I keep on using this word

1347
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:35,639
engage is to talk to our customers to

1348
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:37,719
talk to Growers to learn more I learn

1349
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:42,358
and grow and that's what I

1350
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:45,919
starve uh starve for is education to do

1351
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:49,598
that I have to find Growers and to find

1352
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:52,358
Growers sometimes in illegal markets you

1353
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,559
have to put yourself in positions where

1354
00:55:52,358 --> 00:55:57,199
you are in areas where illegal activity

1355
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,519
is occur

1356
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:01,118
and I'm okay with that I think you have

1357
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,719
to be very discreet you have to be

1358
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,680
mindful of your environment when you're

1359
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:07,639
navigating hopefully you know the people

1360
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:09,558
you're working with and engaging with um

1361
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:11,759
and and I do more than not I've gotten

1362
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:15,319
some great relationships an

1363
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,920
example uh within this last year I was

1364
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:19,519
with some friends I've met in this

1365
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:22,519
industry that are great people uh no

1366
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:26,318
names of course and they invited me to

1367
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:27,798
go to a special session which is I

1368
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:29,719
didn't really know what to expect it was

1369
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:33,038
just a gathering is what I knew and so I

1370
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:35,959
was given an address very discreetly and

1371
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:38,000
a time to meet and when I get there and

1372
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,838
I had to take a train for hours from

1373
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,920
where I was staying in Newcastle so it

1374
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:46,038
was um just for the record not in

1375
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,000
Newcastle and I'll leave it at that and

1376
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:50,400
when I get to this place I get off a

1377
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,119
train and get at Uber and it's in this

1378
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:58,358
old industry part of town uh late on a

1379
00:56:54,119 --> 00:57:01,160
weekend night completely isolated in an

1380
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:03,358
old industrial park and I see a couple

1381
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:05,838
of cars and I kind of Wander over there

1382
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:08,400
and it's dark you know and I am alone

1383
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:12,519
and you see this guy who you know looks

1384
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,880
big and kind of um

1385
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:17,079
dangerous and you make this assumption

1386
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,200
that this is where the thing is and you

1387
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:20,880
go up and you're trying to be modest and

1388
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,199
I have a little leaning to cuz I'm a

1389
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:26,760
foreigner uh from from America at least

1390
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:28,239
from the US and um I text my friend I'm

1391
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,640
like hey I think I'm here so they come

1392
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:34,759
down but this thing turns out to be this

1393
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:38,159
huge like event um this exchange this

1394
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:40,280
swap meet and there's security you go

1395
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:42,199
through two levels of security you go up

1396
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,440
to the third floor and this is all in an

1397
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:48,118
abandoned warehouse in this dark again a

1398
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,760
dark industrial park and as soon as you

1399
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:52,720
get to the third floor and you open up a

1400
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,960
couple more doors there's 400 people in

1401
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:59,000
here there's music there's a coffee bar

1402
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,639
there 's a regular bar there's some food

1403
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,559
and it looks kind of like you know like

1404
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:04,679
a craft fair you ever been to a craft

1405
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,400
fair yeah sure there just a bunch of

1406
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:10,078
card table set up lining the walls

1407
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,000
halfway around this huge room and it's a

1408
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,039
bunch of people with their product

1409
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,199
either they're extracts or they flour or

1410
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:19,119
some people are selling glass so it's

1411
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:22,798
kind of like a craft bear or a swap meat

1412
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:26,358
for cannabis all 100% illegal and it was

1413
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:30,079
a lot of fun people were smoking people

1414
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:34,838
were purchasing people were were buying

1415
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:38,200
and selling and smoking a lot and it

1416
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:40,679
turned out to be a wonderful time but

1417
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:43,399
again you would never know about it

1418
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:45,159
unless you're engaged in the industry

1419
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,798
and you

1420
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:49,558
know I felt comfortable because I

1421
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:52,119
trusted the people that invited me to

1422
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,480
this thing but I had a couple other

1423
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:55,200
people that I knew that I was working

1424
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:58,000
with in the UK that was like you know

1425
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:01,480
what wouldn't do that mate and so I was

1426
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,079
like okay I know I was like I I I I

1427
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,639
respected their opinion but I went ahead

1428
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,240
and checked it out yeah I was really

1429
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:10,000
glad I did up until you open that last

1430
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:12,639
door and you suddenly see people with

1431
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,798
cocktails in their hands and smiling up

1432
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,879
to that up to that very last point it

1433
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:19,519
all sounded sketchy as hell right and

1434
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,519
you're like oh man as a matter of fact

1435
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,519
it's a good thing to point out that some

1436
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,038
of the countries that you were like you

1437
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,679
know when you told me that you were

1438
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:30,839
going to Colombia I was thinking to

1439
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:33,480
myself dude they snatch Americans there

1440
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:36,078
what are you doing like like did you

1441
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,880
ever feel I mean except for maybe when

1442
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,039
you were walking up to that warehouse

1443
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,920
you just told us about were you were

1444
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:45,920
there times when you felt like you were

1445
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,559
in bodily danger uh trying to hunt out

1446
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,400
these these folks who are doing proh

1447
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:53,519
prohibition era

1448
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,880
grow I think that in some areas or some

1449
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:58,159
countries it's pretty close by you know

1450
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,400
I'm always with people that are

1451
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:03,399
typically always with people that are

1452
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,280
from those particular regions or cities

1453
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:08,440
like in meene and you have a second set

1454
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,640
of eyes and a good intuition of people

1455
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,480
that are on the ground that know you

1456
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,000
know if there's a bad neighborhood or a

1457
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,400
good neighborhood this is a pretty fun

1458
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,519
example not to name names but one of my

1459
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,160
uh one of our teammates a year ago uh

1460
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,239
got in a cab and he was looking for some

1461
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:25,358
flour we didn't know anyone in medene at

1462
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:27,078
that time and this young man is from

1463
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,639
Mexico and he's pretty and he's from

1464
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:33,119
Mexico City and so he's used to very

1465
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:36,719
rough areas and this cabie took him to

1466
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,880
this other area they stopped and and in

1467
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:40,598
my teammate he was like man Colin it was

1468
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,200
like like I wouldn't welcome to come

1469
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:45,160
because my complexion was too light in

1470
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:48,239
da and and this young man although he

1471
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:50,719
was from Mexico He was ordered to stay

1472
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:53,358
in the cab and only the cab driver could

1473
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:56,439
go in to exchange because it was that

1474
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:58,679
dangerous and so it's

1475
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:02,039
it can be sketchy but I've never ever

1476
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:04,598
felt like in danger at all quite frankly

1477
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:07,000
CU I'm around the right people and

1478
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:10,200
there's bad areas and and dangerous

1479
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,880
areas and and and safe areas in every

1480
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:16,879
city it happens but it's it's if you if

1481
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:19,280
you take care of of where you're going

1482
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,519
it's really not an issue It also says a

1483
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,760
lot about um you know if any of us were

1484
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:25,559
to go to these places and and try to

1485
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,400
hunt up these beautiful markets you're

1486
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:31,400
describ desing that that that having a

1487
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,960
trusted local is the name of the game

1488
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,160
you have to do that no matter what in

1489
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,760
every country you're not going to go to

1490
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:42,239
Australia or UK even if you engage and

1491
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:44,200
speak the language and necessarily find

1492
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,639
the people that you want to trade with

1493
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:50,558
you you should have people that know the

1494
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:53,318
area and and know people so you can get

1495
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:56,079
so you can get connected with with the

1496
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:57,920
good guys so to speak so so this this

1497
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,278
question may be a non-starter but it's

1498
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,200
kind of a a shot in the dark so and and

1499
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:04,440
maybe I'm being too informed by

1500
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:07,719
Hollywood that's possible too but I was

1501
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,200
curious if you came across like nutrient

1502
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:11,598
cartels right because in these different

1503
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:13,519
countries that you're going to they've

1504
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,200
been doing things the same way for a

1505
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:19,440
long time generally and whatever

1506
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:22,159
nutrients are being input into you know

1507
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,639
the Hydroponics or whatever somebody is

1508
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:26,798
selling that stuff to them and then and

1509
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:29,400
then you come in and you're talking to

1510
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:31,639
people about at the very least a new

1511
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,000
product um which probably actually

1512
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:34,318
doesn't compete with a lot of the stuff

1513
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,400
they're already using because it's so

1514
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:38,920
unique but more so you're starting to

1515
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,318
teach people living soil which is a

1516
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,400
whole different system which will upset

1517
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:45,519
the apple cart on how some of these

1518
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:48,559
people have been making money did you

1519
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:51,199
experience any like you like cannabis

1520
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:54,519
nutrient bad guys you know who are who

1521
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:58,038
who did not appreciate your

1522
01:02:54,519 --> 01:03:01,038
presence no but I do agree that there's

1523
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:02,559
that potential and honestly with a

1524
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,799
category we're in and we're in the

1525
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:09,240
additive category it's a little agnostic

1526
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:12,559
to the nutrient inputs but there are

1527
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:16,118
some clicks I'll call them clicks that

1528
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:18,079
are very strongly opinionated on their

1529
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:20,200
position in the marketplace and they

1530
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:22,920
control that and protect that as much as

1531
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:25,480
they possibly can and so if I was moving

1532
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,559
in to the UK with another nutrient line

1533
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:30,400
or austr with another nutrient line I

1534
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:33,039
don't think that I would be successful

1535
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,960
it's just a a lot of history and a lot

1536
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,839
of products are already there and a lot

1537
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,559
of groups have already taken up a lot of

1538
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:41,838
the market share where we're coming in

1539
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:44,240
with kind of a new category we're coming

1540
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:46,440
in with life in a bottle that's going to

1541
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:48,919
enhance everything you're putting in to

1542
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,278
maximize nutrient uptake and the

1543
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:54,798
synergies there alleviate a lot of that

1544
01:03:51,278 --> 01:03:56,639
for us H right on that's interesting so

1545
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:58,759
this next question

1546
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,000
um it's kind of a different flavor than

1547
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,960
than the rest of the questions that I've

1548
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,920
asked you um uh when we had uh colum

1549
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:10,240
Riley on the show we talked a lot about

1550
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:12,720
the Biore regionalism of microbes and

1551
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:14,719
how if you're going to make you know

1552
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:16,838
nutrient compost teas it's really great

1553
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:19,399
to use local compost that hasn't been

1554
01:04:16,838 --> 01:04:22,759
shipped across the country so that you

1555
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,720
are um you are breeding more microbes

1556
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:26,640
that are local to you and will do well

1557
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:29,519
in your soil your weather and all this

1558
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:32,960
kind of stuff right and and you know i'

1559
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:36,000
I use Mammoth p uh in in my summertime

1560
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:39,920
grow and uh I and and that's got a

1561
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,798
particular microb mix in it so so I am

1562
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:45,760
curious um I guess it's a two-part

1563
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:49,199
question number one did you find that

1564
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,680
people had any uh Fidelity to the idea

1565
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:55,798
that they've got local microbes and and

1566
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:57,598
the second part of the question is um uh

1567
01:04:55,798 --> 01:04:59,318
the microbes that are in your product

1568
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:02,000
appropriate for all these different

1569
01:04:59,318 --> 01:05:03,519
Biore regions that's two really good

1570
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,760
questions and I could kind of spend a

1571
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:07,599
lot of time on that but I I I will

1572
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,240
abbreviate and I'll say that you know I

1573
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,119
think overall there's a lot of ubiquity

1574
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:14,959
where you'll find the same microbial

1575
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:17,079
groups everywhere and so microbes

1576
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,920
bacteria and fungi can adapt to

1577
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,640
different environments and I want to say

1578
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:24,079
that the environment

1579
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,920
selects why there are so much diversity

1580
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:29,960
in any one particular soil is because as

1581
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:32,278
winter and summer uh Seasons uh

1582
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,480
fluctuate and change over time they're

1583
01:05:32,278 --> 01:05:36,838
going to select for microbial resilience

1584
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,599
of some microbial groups and other

1585
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:41,759
microbial groups are going to really be

1586
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:44,119
stressed by that change in in weather

1587
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,079
for example and so you want to maintain

1588
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:50,240
that function and the resilience helps

1589
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:53,359
that having microbes in from a local

1590
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:56,159
Source definitely helps Bridge the

1591
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:59,119
confidence that if you're in ucing them

1592
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,118
to the same climatic or environmental

1593
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,160
conditions you should have confidence

1594
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,720
that they're going to persist what I

1595
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:09,159
will say is microbes in nature and

1596
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:11,598
microbes even in a cloth pot are not the

1597
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:14,519
same environment at the microscopic

1598
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,200
scale it's very different and what we

1599
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:19,000
want to do is make sure we nurture

1600
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:22,558
microbes that are very highly functional

1601
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,278
and very persistent and so I'll say as

1602
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,039
the environment selects as a great

1603
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:28,559
example and this is this is reflecting

1604
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:31,400
on my experiences in manufacturing or

1605
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,119
the R&amp;D for manufacturing our technology

1606
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,720
you know we started off with soils from

1607
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,119
across the world because we wanted to

1608
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:38,399
nurture the biodiversity and the

1609
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:40,680
functional diversity of as many microbes

1610
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,160
as possible what we did is we put them

1611
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:44,118
through a functional trait selection

1612
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:47,038
platform and an environmental trait

1613
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:50,480
selection platform to maximize the the

1614
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:53,039
functional aptitude of any kind of final

1615
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,599
product but also to weed out microbes

1616
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:58,119
that couldn't persist in Environmental

1617
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:00,519
stressful conditions that were

1618
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:02,278
characteristic of farming practices or

1619
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:05,519
the management practices that that

1620
01:07:02,278 --> 01:07:07,920
Growers use in Hydroponics and cannabis

1621
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:11,679
cultivation and we started off sh with

1622
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:14,000
over 10,000 microbial species and after

1623
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,838
we imposed them through our our

1624
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,920
selection platform after many

1625
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:21,078
generations we ended up with four

1626
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:24,000
microbes which suggest that most

1627
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:26,039
microbes aren't effective and

1628
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,358
appropriate for

1629
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:30,760
farming practices and we have to select

1630
01:07:28,358 --> 01:07:33,119
