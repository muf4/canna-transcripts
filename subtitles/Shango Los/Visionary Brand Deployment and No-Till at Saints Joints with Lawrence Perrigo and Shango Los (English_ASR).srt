1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,809
so Larry I the reason I wanted to talk

2
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,958
to you today is because I've become a

3
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:16,849
big fan of the Saints joints packaging

4
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,589
and yeah absolutely the joints are

5
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:22,310
fantastic as well but being a marketing

6
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:23,839
nerd right I notice right away that that

7
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:27,079
there are some interesting things about

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:30,469
your packaging that creates more like

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:33,530
customer loyalty in them so for example

10
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:35,780
you've got certain packs that I think

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,939
that are your your regular line but then

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,120
you also have got these these co-brand

13
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:44,809
packs and and special release packs that

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,129
everybody starts to look for because

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,690
they're you know their special edition

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,030
if they don't buy them now they're not

17
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:50,750
gonna be able to get them yeah yeah

18
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,510
they're all these people on Instagram

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,570
who are we're showing off all of their

20
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:59,390
different Saints packages like proud of

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,890
what they've collected yeah and so I

22
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,480
wanna just wanted to sit down with you

23
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,058
and find out a little bit about how you

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,140
think through that process because your

25
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:08,420
approach is different than most

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,728
everybody is whether they finally settle

27
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,740
on one package and they do they just do

28
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:14,719
that again and again but you're

29
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,369
constantly redesigning your package so

30
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,459
so tell me a little bit about that I

31
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:21,890
have a really short attention span in

32
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:23,478
everything it started out with three

33
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,700
packs it started with the silver pack

34
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:28,129
that's a sativa a gold pack and a gun

35
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:33,320
and agreement pack which was CBD and

36
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:36,649
then we it just kind of naturally moved

37
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:39,618
along as we you know got bored with

38
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,950
these three and then a collaboration

39
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:41,950
pack

40
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,679
and that turned out great and that

41
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:51,419
blossomed into our first collaboration

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:57,450
path but in the meantime we did some

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:01,049
limited mission boxes we did Fried boxes

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:05,579
for yeah we made with 600 the first year

45
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,859
and donated proceeds to equal rights

46
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,669
Washington nice did it another year I

47
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,500
bet you that people buy those just you

48
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,599
know as a historical document Jim you

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,819
know people collect pride things and

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,229
people are proud of pride and so so

51
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,909
people who might not even have been

52
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:23,519
familiar with Saints they were picking

53
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:26,219
those up because you're you're becoming

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,400
an ally with this entire group of people

55
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,550
yeah as who you identify with and

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,830
exactly I do it what do you look for

57
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,890
when you are looking for somebody or an

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:41,040
idea that you want to co-brand with most

59
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,750
the ideas have come from people that

60
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,579
I've worked with in the past or people

61
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,669
that I admire or farms

62
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,590
I admire or even just nice people

63
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:52,199
right on and then that's cool too

64
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,969
because that means that your likelihood

65
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,669
of doing a co-brand with somebody who

66
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:59,879
either a is gonna harass you goes down

67
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:03,599
yeah or B you know when when you

68
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,189
co-brand with somebody you put your

69
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,719
brand is a little vulnerable right

70
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,239
because if they do something that's

71
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,580
jerky then that reflects on you for

72
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,719
having a pack out with them yeah and so

73
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,830
if you're choosing people that are

74
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,969
friends first

75
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,690
yeah it's fight a lot less likely to

76
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:21,419
happen totally and as we as we get as we

77
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,079
sell more and more boxes that comes up

78
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,969
more

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,040
what cuz yeah each time you do a new

80
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,900
co-brand you increase your risk a little

81
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,299
bit yeah that something's gonna go south

82
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,610
totally so um I know you've got a

83
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,140
background in record label yeah so what

84
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,320
are the similarities that you're finding

85
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,899
between how you're managing the the

86
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,969
packaging and the branding for sayings

87
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,430
that are similar to things that you did

88
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:51,629
when you were packaging and marketing

89
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:54,060
records they are so similar that it's I

90
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,049
think that's why it came so easy because

91
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,439
you you know

92
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,540
colored vinyl different variations

93
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,259
limited editions you know making them

94
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:06,569
all different you know just having fun

95
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:11,370
so which comes first a package or the

96
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:14,609
the cultivar choice right it started

97
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,180
with the packaging but now the cultivar

98
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,340
choice is the

99
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,189
especially in the Washington market with

100
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,769
there's so much everybody it's so the

101
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:26,199
competition is really high oh yeah and

102
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:28,149
so many of the companies like feel the

103
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,120
same that was one thing I noticed when

104
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:34,060
we were just touring your your grow

105
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,030
rooms is that I was smelling smells that

106
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,978
I don't get when I tour many other grow

107
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:41,559
rooms there's a lot of there's a lot of

108
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,870
unique terpene hits yeah then I'm like

109
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,038
oh I haven't smelled that you know in a

110
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:50,379
room before and and so it lines up

111
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,329
really well with your unique packaging

112
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:54,728
too right because I I see that you mean

113
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:59,469
your packages are also psychedelic right

114
00:04:54,728 --> 00:05:02,560
and so you're pointing out that this is

115
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,650
an uncommon product in the packaging and

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,550
then when they open it they know hey

117
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:12,098
this is uncommon yeah yeah we try to

118
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,939
make sure that none of our plants taste

119
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:19,538
or smell the same we have around right

120
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:21,879
now about 20 varieties and then we're

121
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:26,620
constantly adding to them and as we go

122
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:30,759
along so um how many different packages

123
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,939
have you made in total now I would say

124
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:36,848
right around 25 and are you still

125
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:40,449
running those original three still we I

126
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:42,629
constantly change them right so if you

127
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:45,280
look at them you'll see the small

128
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:46,939
inconsistencies or differences for a

129
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,309
true sanctuary

130
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:54,350
I just like the record first pressing

131
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:55,790
second pressing you know um you know one

132
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,100
of the things that I noticed when we

133
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,020
were walking through manufacturing is is

134
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,480
how everything is still very much done

135
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:04,399
by hand you know I spend a lot of time

136
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,410
in California now and everybody is

137
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,599
talking about scaling right yeah how

138
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,520
everything is getting scaled up and you

139
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,250
got to be able to produce pounds for

140
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,959
$400 and when we're all sitting there in

141
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,759
the rooms listening these people talk

142
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,799
about this we're all going that's gonna

143
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,550
taste bad yeah you know it's like this

144
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:28,310
that's a plan for lots of mids yeah so

145
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:31,009
so how does the doing the packaging by

146
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,410
hand and doing a hand trim on beautiful

147
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:38,599
flowers how does that also express

148
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:41,510
itself in the garden if if you wait we

149
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,360
try to do everything like to 100% that

150
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,279
we can you know that we can do with all

151
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,560
the tools we have you know we're in

152
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,348
Seattle we're not in we're not in the

153
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,490
bar

154
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:57,728
but if if if you take the care at every

155
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:00,098
single step the customer will well know

156
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:02,560
damn well week we're not perfect you

157
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:06,098
know nobody's perfect through a scaling

158
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,949
we'll see um people who follow shape and

159
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:11,649
fire know that I'm a real nerd for for

160
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:14,110
Noto and KNF and probiotic inputs and

161
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:15,218
stuff and when I came to talk to you

162
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,229
today you know I was coming to talk

163
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:20,110
about the packaging right because that's

164
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,938
what that's what we drew me to but but

165
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,879
then I find out your no-till as well so

166
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:27,218
so for folks who folks who came for the

167
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,699
packaging and now are gonna stay for the

168
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:33,550
no-till yeah tell us a little bit about

169
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,528
how you you are expressing Noto and

170
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,500
compost teas and stuff in your in your

171
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:41,379
grow well it's been a long journey

172
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:45,579
obviously I try to eat organic smoked

173
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:49,270
organic everything and when I started

174
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:51,339
delving into it did the plant house went

175
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:55,209
down and then the clan help came up

176
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:59,250
really fast and now I've never seen as

177
00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:01,769
many the whole buildings go be green

178
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,149
plants it's amazing you know and we're

179
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:05,879
getting better and better

180
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,739
just like the foreheads um so the little

181
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,240
dip you had because a lot of people you

182
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,069
know they're concerned and I hear this

183
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,230
from growers all the time if they're if

184
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,899
they're historically using salt bottled

185
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,930
newts they're afraid to make the move

186
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:21,719
over to no-till or can a poor probiotic

187
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,300
because there's a lot on the line they

188
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,880
can't have a cycle that goes bad right

189
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,540
because that could be six figures yep so

190
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,519
so the little dip that you have had do

191
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,360
you think that dip was because the

192
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,799
plants themselves were going through a

193
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,629
botanical transition or do you think

194
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,359
that was more your learning curve and

195
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:42,809
getting them flipped both both in the

196
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,669
soil

197
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:51,199
it was the soil health and it's yeah

198
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:54,120
it's obvious what now nowadays and

199
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,020
luckily we didn't have a whole lot on

200
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,580
the line when we took that dip yeah so

201
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:01,529
let's go let's the lose which allows you

202
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,050
to experiment more yep totally right on

203
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,789
cool well I really hope that you keep up

204
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:10,799
