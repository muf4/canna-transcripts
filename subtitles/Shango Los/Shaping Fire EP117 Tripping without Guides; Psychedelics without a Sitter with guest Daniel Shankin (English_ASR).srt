2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,839
it's really something isn't it how

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,439
people are talking about psychedelic

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:15,519
mushrooms like simply everywhere now and

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,160
sure many of us had lots of mushrooms in

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,000
our subculture is growing up and it's

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,359
nothing new but we're talking about

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,759
mushrooms being discussed on CNN and

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,960
daytime talk shows it really is

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,039
something some folks are talking about

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,519
micro doing and others are talking about

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,640
macro doing but everyone seems to feel

13
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,479
much more free to discuss mushroom use

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,239
and benefits nowadays it's very common

15
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:39,039
for the media to talk about the

16
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,799
importance of using mushrooms in a

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,558
clinical setting or for psychologists to

18
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,439
suggest the importance of having a guide

19
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,839
or trip sitter because of this there is

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,599
a creeping assumption that everyone

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,800
should have a psychedelic safety coach

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,439
involved with their

23
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,119
self-discovery I'm not of that opinion

24
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,159
certainly some folks should definitely

25
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,399
seek these types of support and it is

26
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,038
very good that they exist but the vast

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,198
number of people don't actually need a

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,000
guide there are records of human beings

29
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,039
using psychedelics for over 9,000 years

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,478
our species has a long and positive

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
relationship with the psilocybin

32
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,000
mushroom and if you follow some simple

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,159
but important best practices you or you

about psychedelic integration the use of

74
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:42,039

importance of psychedelics as both

76
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,959
Recreation and for self-discovery I came

77
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,318
across his social media channels and

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,959
started getting some really good

79
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,799
perspective from him then Daniel Morford

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,759
from Heart Rock Mountain cannabis

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,840
introduced us and we quickly chose a

82
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:59,199
date to pull together this episode for

83
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,840
you during the first set today we will

84
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,958
consider the differences between having

85
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,200
a trip sitter or guide and going it

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,199
alone or with friends and then we will

87
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,719
discuss best practices for going into

88
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,959
your psychedelic trip with good mindset

89
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,479
and setting in the second set we'll

90
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,680
offer some tips on preparing for your

91
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,238
trip locations and things to do while

92
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,400
you're high and during the third set we

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,200
will discuss psychedelic integration

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,799
what that is and how to make sure that

95
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,238
you're able to bring your lessons in

96
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,120
healing from psychedelics back into your

97
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,560
daily life there are two important notes

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,840
about today's episode first I recently

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,598
upgraded the shaping fire studio so all

100
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,598
the episodes will sound even better than

101
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:41,199
they already do alas I thought that I

102
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,919
had all the settings dialed in and

103
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,318
tested but I did not at some point

104
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,839
before we recorded I hit the gain and

105
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,359
threw it off significantly because of

106
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,560
that my voice was recorded too boldly

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,959
and now Clips a great deal throughout

108
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,640
the entire episode Daniel's voice sounds

109
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,759
perfect though but I don't sound so well

110
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,598
our shaping fire sound engineer did an

111
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,359
excellent job making my voice listenable

112
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,359
but yeah you'll hear my voice sound

113
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,280
crappy this episode after 171 podcast

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,159
episodes of being my own sound

115
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,878
technician I was bound to make an error

116
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:18,159
sometime and and that is today we have

117
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,319
adjusted the gain and taped it in place

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,720
now so we shouldn't run into this again

119
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,159
so thanks for your patience with the

120
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,040
sound of my voice today second neither

121
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,040

00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,478
of the kind of the opposite of what the

psychedelics either by themselves or

167
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:10,918
with friends and not using a counselor

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,720
or a facilitator involved but I want to

169
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,799
make sure right off the bat that that we

170
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,240
make sure people know that that we're

171
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,240
not saying don't use a facilitator for

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,840
for many people and for many goals using

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,079
a f facilitator is exceptionally helpful

174
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:30,598
maybe even vital to their healing

175
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:33,560
process so um you know you are a trainer

176
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:36,279
of psychedelic facilitators so so let's

177
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,319
start out with that question what are

178
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:43,519
some of the good reasons to um to engage

179
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,960
a psychedelic facilitator um when

180
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:51,079
someone uh chooses to do psychedelic

181
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:53,399
healing well you well you might want a

182
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,758
certain level of care right you might

183
00:06:53,399 --> 00:07:00,000
want a certain level of safety and care

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,520
that maybe isn't available with just um

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,759
friends or family or by yourself you

186
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:08,159
might also

187
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,759
want uh when I say safety I I mean of

188
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,800
course like physical safety we don't

189
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,598
want you running off into traffic but

190
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:19,199
maybe you want a uh like a psychological

191
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,878
or emotional safety uh as we know uh

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
psychedelics can

193
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:27,039
really occasion

194
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:30,478
catharsis right people um have emotional

195
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:32,918
releases they might have old memories

196
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,800
resurface and that might not be the kind

197
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:37,318
of thing that you feel comfortable

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,478
talking about with just like your buddy

199
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,039
um but when you're with somebody who

200
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,758
you've worked with for some time you've

201
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,800
built up kind of a therapeutic

202
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,879
relationship and a certain amount of of

203
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,840
Rapport and you've already started to

204
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,400
kind of like open the doors to the stuff

205
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:56,758
that's you know in your closet uh it

206
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:59,079
might uh do you really well to go deeper

207
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,960
into those places and that can allow a

208
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,359
lot of

209
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,318
kind of stuff to come up and to be

210
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,240
released and to be processed and to have

211
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,639
somebody who's trained who knows how to

212
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,360
hold space for that and knows how to

213
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,680
reflect back and sort of guide you into

214
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,360
like a proactive Direction uh can really

215
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,000
come in handy for sure we don't want to

216
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,639
be in this situation where all of our

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,279
walls are down and we're being very

218
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,960
vulnerable and we're ready to do work on

219
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,839
something that's really important to us

220
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,079
but we happen to be with somebody who

221
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,038
isn't the sort of friend that we want to

222
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,679
share those kind of intimate details

223
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,120
with because um you know if if we're

224
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,958
approaching these psychedelic um

225
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,240
modalities to heal sometimes the healing

226
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,879
looks like you know bringing up our our

227
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,000
some pretty sensitive Secrets yeah it

228
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,838
can be messy yeah

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,519
and um and that and it can even make

230
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,720
things go weird like I don't know if

231
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,560
you've ever I'm sure your audience knows

232
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,360
what it's like to sit on an

233
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,679
uncomfortable secret right or to kind of

234
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,720
have stuff that wants to come out and

235
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,399
wants to be seen but you don't feel safe

236
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,800
and maybe there's shame or maybe there's

237
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,839
anxiety or whatever it is and you can't

238
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:16,838
share it and things can go sideways like

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,040
think people are like what's wrong with

240
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,920
you what's going on and like the whole

241
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:23,000
vibe gets weirder and weirder and

242
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,278
weirder um so that can happen right if

243
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,799
you're holding things back on the flip

244
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:31,679
side I've talked to folks

245
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,958
who have a lot of experience with like

246
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,759
let's just MDMA let's talk about MDMA

247
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,919
for example and they've partied with it

248
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,958
they've gone to shows they've gone to

249
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,759
concerts they've gone to you know good

250
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,719
times with their friends in front of the

251
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,720
fire and it was just always a chill and

252
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,480
a sweet

253
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,560
time and then they decided hey maybe I

254
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,480
want to do some more work I'm already

255
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,199
familiar with this molecule I know how

256
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,800
it acts and then you take them out of

257
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,759
the one setting and you so we should

258
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,240
probably talk a lot about set and

259
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,439
setting tonight so you take them out of

260
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,919
this kind of friendly recreational

261
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,560
setting and you put them in a

262
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,278
therapeutic setting where the space is

263
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,518
there for them and it's an entirely

264
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,039
different medicine and then all of a

265
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,519
sudden this person can access things

266
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,599
that again have been wanting to be seen

267
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,679
and you know uh things that have wanted

268
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
wanting to be acknowledged and loved for

269
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,879
years and years and years it can finally

270
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,079
come out because the space and the

271
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,838
setting is there for them excellent and

272
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:28,838
yes we will be we will be talking a lot

273
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,839
about um set and setting here just in a

274
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,320
little bit

275
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,640
the other thing I want to hit before we

276
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,278
move on about the good reasons just some

277
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,319
of the good reasons to use a facilitator

278
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,360
is that um a lot of people who are drawn

279
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,360
to psychedelics have you know pretty

280
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,759
serious pre-existing issues that they're

281
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,639
trying to sort out whether it be you

282
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:50,399
know schizophrenia or anxiety or

283
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:53,000
psychosis or or a history of things that

284
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,958
if you're going to try to go on a

285
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,679
healing path such as this um it can get

286
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,919
complex and perhaps even mentally

287
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,078
dangerous quickly and so you might want

288
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:06,958
to have someone trained in these areas

289
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,159
present instead of putting that weight

290
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,518
of helping you in a crisis situation on

291
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,759
your friends or just yourself so I'm

292
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,639
sure there's a host of those as well

293
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,879
there's that and then also you know we

294
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:23,799
have the Renaissance happening right the

295
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:25,480
psychelic come up is is going on and

296
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:28,039
what this means is that there are a

297
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,839
whole lot of new people who may have

298
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:33,360
never considered psyched before right

299
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,079
and so I'm guessing you know from from

300
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,959
what I know about you and your audience

301
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:42,278
and you know our mutual friend um Daniel

302
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:46,439
yeah Daniel har rocks shout out Daniel

303
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:48,240
heart rocks um we've kind of grown up

304
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,279
like like these are heads who have grown

305
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,519
up with psychedelic people and

306
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,679
psychedelic friends and like you know if

307
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:58,440
if I needed a friend of mine to sit for

308
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:01,359
me like I can call somebody who's who

309
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,760
I've known for sometime for years and i'

310
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720

00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,078
that sounds awesome will you do that for

316
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,440
me next month right because we've been

317
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:20,799
through it but then you've got folks who

318
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,639
are don't have that don't have that kind

319
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,240
of community they're coming from like

320
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,198
you know middle class wherever they're

321
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,879
coming from n9o FES they're coming from

322
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:31,039
straight lace family life and they're

323
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,799
like I don't know anybody I don't have I

324
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:37,039
don't have any Community like

325
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:39,399
that and so they kind of need some of

326
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,120
that you know and a facilitator can kind

327
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:45,159
of fill that role and also kind of like

328
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,639
guide them into like the world of

329
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:51,078
psychedelics like the world view of

330
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:54,000
psychedelics right on so uh my dear

331
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:56,078
audience um we are in favor of using a

332
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,440
facilitator when it's called for but

333
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,439
what we're going to focus on today is um

334
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,600
when you choose to do psychedelics

335
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,720
without um a clinician or a facilitator

336
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,399
because you know um we are in favor of

337
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,759
facilitators but often you know

338
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,480
sometimes the price is very high um

339
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,159
getting into the thousands of dollars

340
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,278
and sometimes folks don't want to take a

341
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,879
psychedelic in a clinical environment

342
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,919
and they they're not able to find a

343
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:24,360
facilitator that does something not in a

344
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,319
clinical environment um or perhaps they

345
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,120
don't want to have the facilitator's

346
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,480
energy U mingling with themselves during

347
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,159
during the trip and so that there there

348
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,079
you know there are good reasons to want

349
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,439
a facilitator and there's also good

350
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:39,759
reasons to choose to not use a

351
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,839
facilitator um this little beginning of

352
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,679
the show the point is just to tell you

353
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,639
that even though the show is about um

354
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:50,638
going it alone or with friends this does

355
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,959
not mean that we are uh discouraging the

356
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,278
other so I think we hit that pretty well

357
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,039
oh do you want to say something else on

358
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:59,639
that Daniel um yeah and I also

359
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:02,480
again you said the disclaimer I just I

360
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:06,839
want to use the term sort of harm

361
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,680
reduction right and education and um

362
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,240
benefit maximization right this is

363
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:13,439
offered in the spirit of harm reduction

364
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,320
um you know this is and this is one

365
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:21,199
strange man's opinion so I I definitely

366
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,759
suggest you know checking um you know

367
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,278
like doing your homework and things like

368
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,399
that um I'm going to show up for you all

369
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,320
the best I can and and I'm excited about

370
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,159
this because this could we can use this

371
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,160
is like a resource in the future about

372
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:38,039
like sort of a friends and family or

373
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:40,120
solo guide to this sort of work that is

374
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,519
that is exactly the goal the the the

375
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,440
shaping fire episodes are always quite

376
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,320
Evergreen um so that they people can

377
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,079
continue to use them over time and you

378
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,120
know sometimes we're talking about you

379
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,919
know um you know a handbook of growing

380
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,278
cannabis or using cannabis or making

381
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:58,799
medicine and today we're talking about

382
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,879
psychedelics so let's get right into it

383
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,000
by talking about mindset and setting

384
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,399
which you have already brought up um

385
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,039
it's pretty much the Cornerstone of drug

386
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,159
usage and um I'd like to start with the

387
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:14,599
first part mindset um what are the some

388
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:16,919
of the factors in um coming to the

389
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,079
Psychedelic experience with a good

390
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,000
mindset we'll talk about setting in a

391
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,078
couple minutes but let's let's focus on

392
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,759
mindset first what what what what do we

393
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,799
want to bring to the Psychedelic

394
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,919
experience for good for their best

395
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,198
practice results well can I take a step

396
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,679
back and talk a little about bit about

397
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,198
the history of set and setting for sure

398
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:40,198
go for it so there was a time like way

399
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:45,318
back in the 50s um when there were

400
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:48,399
researchers who studied LSD as um

401
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:50,838
something that mimicked the experience

402
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,480
of having psychosis right they were like

403
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,519
oh wow this molecule creates Psy a

404
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,720
psychosis like experience for people and

405
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,720
so if we give it to them they'll be

406
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,040
psychotic for eight hours and we can

407
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,480
study that and sure enough they would

408
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,399
give it to people and they would they

409
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,360
would give it to people and they would

410
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,078
go psychotic for eight hours and then

411
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,519
they were shocked to meet like the

412
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,599
hippies of hate Street who had you know

413
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,078
their velvet couches and their Paisley

414
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,720
shirts and their music and lava lamps

415
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,278
and what have you and that their

416
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,480
willingness to dance and to be groovy

417
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,240
and those people weren't going psychotic

418
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,959
they were having mystical experiences of

419
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,198
love and Oneness M and it was confusing

420
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:38,039
and what the researchers realized is

421
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,758
that this is dependent these molecules

422
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,799
are dependent on set and setting like

423
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,800
Advil for example works the same if you

424
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,519
take it on the mountain or in the beach

425
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,479
or in an office or on a plane and a

426
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,839
train you know with a goat in a boat

427
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,079
right yeah so they kind of decided oh it

428
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,199
probably just works like that it just

429
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,679
works the same but what they found is

430
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:57,159
that if you put somebody in a hospital

431
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,638
and you strap them to a gurnie and you

432
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,120
put them under bright lights and you

433
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,600
tell them they're going to go psychotic

434
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,919
and then you ask them really probing

435
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,519
questions with the clipboard for eight

436
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:06,438
hours they guess what you get a

437
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,798
psychotic person I might do that without

438
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,000
I might go psychotic in that situation

439
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:16,480
without drugs exactly yeah right and so

440
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,919
there has been this um exploration about

441
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,798
what are optimal set and settings for

442
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,120
particular results for particular people

443
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,599
and like you were saying um that might

444
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,519
freak me out even without drugs certain

445
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,439
sets certain settings

446
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,319
and certain sets are better for some

447
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,960
people certain settings are better for

448
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,159
other people right so there's no one

449
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,759
size fits all and so this journey you

450
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:46,720
know hopefully if we're talking about um

451
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:49,079
healthy use perhaps over time right and

452
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,640
that maybe we're going slow maybe we're

453
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:55,519
starting with low dosages and and so on

454
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:59,480
and so forth but back to set say back to

455
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:02,000
mindset um you're going to bring

456
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,240
yourself with you into a psychedelic

457
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,359
experience right so you're bringing you

458
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,640
right um and what they they call

459
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,359
psychedelics um for the most part right

460
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,600
the the true psychedelics non-specific

461
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,879
amplifiers and what non-specific

462
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:21,319
amplifier means is that it brings up the

463
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,320
stuff that's already there in a lot of

464
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,079
ways right and sometimes it smooth you

465
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,599
know sometimes it does add that love and

466
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:32,960
connectivity and that's really nice too

467
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:36,119
um but people say oh it made me anxious

468
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,880
or it made me afraid well not really

469
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,279
like you have that in you already it was

470
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,840
bringing that up it made me feel like I

471
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,440
was garbage and I wasn't worth loving

472
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,639
well no you've been carrying that around

473
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,798
for decades now you get a chance to look

474
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:55,440
at it so educating people at least about

475
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:57,000
that is a big deal so people are not so

476
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,159
and of course people forget it of all

477
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,759
the time but um if you can sit with

478
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,000
people and kind of um coach them on

479
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,640
recognizing that that's one of the

480
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,400
things that can possibly happen that's

481
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,038
important so they're not so surprised

482
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,640
when they come face to face with their

483
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,720
own stuff their own shadow perhaps

484
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,520
what's also important to recognize is

485
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,360
not only are you dealing with stuff that

486
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:24,240
is potentially very very old but your

487
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:29,240
recent environment and experiences play

488
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:32,440
a part so if you have been

489
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,440
watching a lot of election news you know

490
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,279
you've been watching a lot of like

491
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,798
fear-based news before your trip that's

492
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,558
not going to help um if you've been

493
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:46,240
watching horror movies that's not going

494
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:49,678
to help um although if you

495
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,120
watch um the Lord of the Rings trilogy

496
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,919
that actually might help right the

497
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,519
hero's journey right so you're tuning

498
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,240
yourself you're tuning yourself into

499
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,679
like archetypal forces so you know a

500
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,400
good good things that people often do to

501
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,559
get ready is not only they they do

502
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,759
various diets and so they might limit

503
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,038
their food they might eat cleaner food

504
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,519
so that you don't have to process the

505
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:16,119
food on the journey and deal with that

506
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:18,440
whole thing um you might read more um

507
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:21,079
higher higher Vibe literature whatever

508
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,000
that means for you I was talking to um a

509
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:26,319
student yesterday and she was um telling

510
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,679
me that she really like she there's a

511
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,599
graveyard near her house that has a stat

512
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,840
statue of Jesus in The Garden of

513
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,359
Gethsemane and she reads the Bible and

514
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:39,439
she listens to George Harrison and

515
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,798
that's like she knows that works for her

516
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,400
right and I'm not you know I don't have

517
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:45,079
opinions on other people's religion so

518
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,440
just just that's just religious beliefs

519
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:49,480
that's her story and it's nice right

520
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,200
because it is certainly it's it's really

521
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,798
high Vibe for her it puts her in a place

522
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,038
of faith it puts her in a place of love

523
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:58,839
and connectivity and for other people

524
00:20:55,038 --> 00:21:03,440
that might be um Tibetan bows right or

525
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:05,879
or throat chanting or um um you know

526
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,679
vdic chanting or devotional chanting or

527
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,640
things like that but you know if we

528
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:15,120
start to turn down um the ordinary and

529
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,159
the mundane and we start to turn up the

530
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,278
um the vibrations that we want to

531
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,120
resonate with you know higher vibration

532
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,480
things that are in alignment with our

533
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,798
intentions that usually goes pretty well

534
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,640
for people right and this brings us to

535
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,798
intention perhaps can still table it if

536
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,000
you have more questions about s setting

537
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:36,679
um well just one thing I want to add too

538
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,519
I love I love the idea of of create you

539
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,200
know um creating a mental environment

540
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,558
that that you think is going to work for

541
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,120
the the kind of work you want to do um

542
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,639
but I also generally like to point out

543
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,879
to people to to be doing the Psychedelic

544
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,880
because you want to um over the course

545
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,159
of my life I have certainly seen people

546
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,159
be peer pressured into doing

547
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,840
psychedelics because the rest of the

548
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,640
group was and to to make sure that

549
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,240
you're doing it for for the right

550
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,679
reasons that are that are your own in

551
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,839
addition to you know removing the uh

552
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,679
immediate um stressors that we were

553
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,158
talking about right oh right so yeah

554
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,798
turn your phone off give yourself a dope

555
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,000
and bean break from your phone for sure

556
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:22,879
um but when we talk about mindset one of

557
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,759
the key tools for mindset is um having a

558
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,960
personal intention right so like you

559
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,558
were saying man um know why you're doing

560
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,000
it like do it because you want to and

561
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:34,200
know why you want to like I'm doing this

562
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,159
to heal this I'm doing this to look at

563
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,360
that I'm doing this to come become more

564
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,600
in alignment with um my romantic partner

565
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,959
I'm doing this to become more in

566
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:46,399
alignment with the Divine you know what

567
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,798
whatever it is and then what I usually

568
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,360
recommend to people is um whatever that

569
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:56,278
intention is is uh try to wrate it out

570
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,918
sort of in like Mantra form and what I

571
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:00,480
mean by that is is like short and sweet

572
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,000
right you wouldn't want something oh and

573
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,240
I kind of want this and maybe I want

574
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,960
that and the other

575
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,159
thing you want something like short and

576
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,440
sweet that is going to kind of cut

577
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,799
through the noise right so that you can

578
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,320
focus your mind on it in a psychedelic

579
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,200
state right some of our our most

580
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:20,439
well-known mantras in the west are

581
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,200
psychedelically inspired things like be

582
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,120
here now right by ramas everybody knows

583
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,840
be here now that's a psychedelic

584
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,479
intention um Let It Be by the Beatles

585
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,519
right there's a story that says that the

586
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,360
mother Mary that is referenced and let

587
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,960
it be was Maria Sabina the curandera

588
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,719
from Mexico right let it be and then of

589
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,880
course we all know Dr Bronner is all one

590
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,440
or none right so these sorts of like

591
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,120
short sweet like poignant like cut

592
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:53,120
through the noise um intentions that we

593
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:56,319
can use as an anchor that will root us

594
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,199
in our minds when everything is swirling

595
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,000
and if folks are hearing this and going

596
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,600
ah

597
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm not going to do this woooo stuff I'm

598
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,000
just going to take the drug and go for

599
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,038
it I want to encourage you that that

600
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,919
these types of intentional setups they

601
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:13,798
actually do work and while to many

602
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:16,520
people this kind of um internal

603
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:19,038
awareness of intention might be

604
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:22,480
dismissible in this realm that you're

605
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:25,960
about to play in um it it is it is

606
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,599
essential and uh by by creating this

607
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:33,319
intention you truly give Direct ction to

608
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,480
your mind and spirit of the direction

609
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:39,200
that you want to go and having an

610
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:42,640
intention and and giving your um Mind

611
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,480
and Spirit a direction to go in is going

612
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,440
to be far more effective in most cases

613
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,240
than just going into it without an

614
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,759
intention and just kind of like riding

615
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,919
the Bronco whatever random Direction it

616
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:57,158
goes in um we're talking about best

617
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:00,080
practices today and having intention is

618
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,039
truly a corner Stone best practice oh

619
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,199
yeah I mean do people can do what they

620
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,720
want um you know if somebody thinks that

621
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,399
what we're saying is woo woo I'm I'm

622
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,200
surprised that they're still listening

623
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:13,199
yeah um and I'm not I'm not really here

624
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,600
to I'm not I'm not trying to sell it you

625
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,120
right right it's known you know you guys

626
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:22,278
and what I would even suggest um my

627
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:26,038
friends are try it both ways you know

628
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:27,880
it's like run run an experiment you know

629
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:28,960
and see how it goes report back I'd love

630
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,278
to hear

631
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,278
you know do it a couple of different

632
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,679
ways come to our we've got integration

633
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:35,440
circles where people can come and talk

634
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,679
about this stuff every week let me know

635
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,360
how it goes right on the last thing I

636
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,519
want to touch on here in mindset um uh

637
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:46,359
well good mindset anyway is um uh I

638
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:50,398
think it's pretty important to have

639
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:52,278
faith in the in your drugs if if if your

640
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:56,119
um if your psychedelic comes from a

641
00:25:52,278 --> 00:26:00,240
sketchy source and you're not sure what

642
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:03,199
you're taking um uh that can come up at

643
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,759
the worst times right as the Psychedelic

644
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,278
is coming on and you suddenly feel like

645
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,879
it's brewing and it's about to come on

646
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,919
and and then suddenly you get this hit

647
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,640
of adrenaline because now you're second

648
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,000
guessing your source and of course any

649
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,240
kind of drug even if they're not

650
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,240
psychedelics you should know your Source

651
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,558
but with psychedelics since it's such um

652
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,079
a momentous experience be sure to have

653
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:28,480
faith in the quality and cleanliness of

654
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,558
the Psychedelic that you're using um

655
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,558
because not only are there there it's

656
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,519
important for your personal health but

657
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,480
it's also important for your mindset you

658
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,240
can just kind of like check that box of

659
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:44,000
safety off that that that that you don't

660
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,759
have to worry about the veracity of of

661
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,159
of the of the Psychedelic that you're

662
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,359
taking this is an interesting point yeah

663
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,200
so test your drugs kids right go to

664
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,519
dance safe you can you can get drug

665
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,640
tests you can get test kits um I think

666
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,918
if you go to my link Tree on Instagram

667
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,720
like I think um

668
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,960
with a roll kit like I'm an affiliate

669
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,640
for roll kit you can you can get test

670
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,798
kits there too um but we want to get as

671
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,759
much

672
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:14,038
sketchiness out of the thing as we out

673
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,558
of the situation as we possibly can

674
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:17,558
right for those of us who kind of grew

675
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:19,558
up under the kind of the shadow of the

676
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,798
drug war right we knew that there was a

677
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:24,000
lot of stigma there was a lot of fear uh

678
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:25,759
we were all we were worried about

679
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
getting caught we were worried about

680
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,200
what would happen if people knew um

681
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,558
there was all of this anxiety around

682
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,880
that and also that ends up internalizing

683
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,839
as self-judgment oh am I doing something

684
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,760
wrong and maybe on some level we get off

685
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:42,839
on doing something that's a little taboo

686
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,839
but on another level like it gets in

687
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,199
there and I don't know if any of you

688
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:50,038
have had the chance to take psychedelics

689
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,880
in Colorado since it's been

690
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:55,359
decriminalized but it's kind of a whole

691
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,720
different thing because that kind of

692
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,398
worry and those belief systems that are

693
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,960
kind of cultural and we've been carrying

694
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:05,158
them around in our in our uh subculture

695
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,360
for some time that's starting to get

696
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,559
cleaned up and people are starting to be

697
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:13,199
able to have Freer experiences where

698
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:16,319
they are not worried about being caught

699
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,960
or being judged or things like that um

700
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,038
but but part of that means is that you

701
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,278
potentially have an opportunity to

702
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,679
cultivate relationships with people in a

703
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:29,278
new way where it's not surreptitious and

704
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:32,120
it's not under a bridge and and um you

705
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,720
know I got Pals who are on Instagram

706
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,398
saying hey please come learn how to

707
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,240
micro do I'll give you a month's Supply

708
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,839
right it's it's wild they're in Colorado

709
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,079
and so like that's hopefully going to

710
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,240
become more and more of the norm where

711
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:51,000
people can

712
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:52,798
feel um free and confident and peaceful

713
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,480
around the fact that they are exercising

714
00:28:52,798 --> 00:29:00,038
their cognitive Liberty right on so um I

715
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,360
I want to TCH on briefly some of the

716
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,398
factors that would constitute like maybe

717
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,678
a challenging mindset like I already

718
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,079
mentioned one earlier the feeling of

719
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,120
being pressured like you're being peer

720
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,759
pressured to do it because you know your

721
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:13,158
other people in your life are doing it

722
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,079
and and they're kind of dragging you

723
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,919
into it when you're not ready um what

724
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,398
might be another you know one or two

725
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,799
mindsets that are challenging that you

726
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:25,599
might caution folks to take a take a

727
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:27,839
psychedelics during that period of their

728
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,678
life well are are you fighting with your

729
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:33,158
girl

730
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,240
um did you just lose your job um do you

731
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,519
not

732
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,720
have um housing do you not have safe

733
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,000
housing um did your electricity get

734
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,759
turned off um have you not been eating

735
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,880
well um these kinds of things yeah right

736
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:51,278
so you know if that you would want

737
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,320
there's like a maslo hierarchy so you

738
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:57,159
you definitely want like your basic

739
00:29:53,319 --> 00:30:01,158
safety needs taken care of right so that

740
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:05,200
kind of thing uh you would want your

741
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:08,159
relationships uh you know um relatively

742
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,880
speaking to be in a fairly good spot you

743
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,640
know you'd want a certain amount of

744
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,039
space in your work life right you

745
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,480
wouldn't want to have

746
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,558
to um be on the phone right up until you

747
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,319
took the medicine and then be on the

748
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:26,720
phone right as it wears down right that

749
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,879
would be stressful especially if it's a

750
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,880
stressful thing yeah going on at work um

751
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,399
so these kinds of pressure right so it's

752
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,278
interesting because your podcast is

753
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:44,398
called shaping fire and I'm really

754
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:47,480
interested in um the idea of shape right

755
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:49,079
from like a sematic perspective right so

756
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,399
you you famili do you think your people

757
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:53,000
are familiar with the term sematic sure

758
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,638
but but not everybody so go right ahead

759
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,519
and fill it in so sematic is a Greek

760
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:58,839
term it means the living body in its

761
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,759
wholeness

762
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:04,798
and so it means that we're this holistic

763
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:07,720
organism this Mind Body nervous system

764
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:10,278
thing entity right personality um whole

765
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:15,399
this whole thing and this whole thing is

766
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:17,960
a whole thing um and it is expressed

767
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:21,359
through the body right so so one of the

768
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:25,319
ideas of of of sematic kind of theory

769
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:29,199
philosophy is that your entire your

770
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:31,519
body is a representation of your entire

771
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,679
history right everything that has

772
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,079
happened to you is smudged on your body

773
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,320
like clay in some ways so the way that

774
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,079
you walk the way that you hold yourself

775
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:43,439
the way that you react under stress and

776
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:47,199
pressure right this has been developed

777
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,000
over years right through um through your

778
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,399
experience right and the way people work

779
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,480
in the world and then what's interesting

780
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,798
is that once you're shaped um you then

781
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,558
shape the world that way and then you

782
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,558
shape your own experience

783
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,398
because let's say somebody feels like

784
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,240
they're not worthy of love like they

785
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,359
have that deep belief I'm not worthy of

786
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,480
love I don't deserve it there isn't

787
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:11,479
enough love out there for me well you

788
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,159
can imagine how somebody who believes

789
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,278
that deep in their soul since they were

790
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,399
like 5 years old might walk through the

791
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,119
world and hold themselves in their body

792
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,038
it's going to be very different like you

793
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,638
could put two people in somebody who is

794
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,759
like I'm definitely worthy of love like

795
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:27,079
I'm full of love I've love to give I'm

796
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:29,158
open to receive love I know it's it's

797
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:31,038
the best stuff in the world I love my

798
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,919
friends I love my family they love me I

799
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,480
know it and you put those two people

800
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,600
next to each other and you tell them

801
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,960
just stand neutral you can tell who's

802
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:43,678
who it'd be obvious right and so then

803
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,440
the way those people move through the

804
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,399
world is going to be

805
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,558
different right and so the person who

806
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,759
doesn't believe they're worthy of Love

807
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:54,000
is going to act in ways that reinforce

808
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,200
that and the person who believes that

809
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,638
they are worthy of Love is going to act

810
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,679
in ways that reinforces that and then

811
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:00,798
they're going to get more of what

812
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,919
they've been getting because they keep

813
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:07,519
doing what they're

814
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:10,038
doing um and so what we are trying to do

815
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,240
is what was the question how did I get

816
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:15,000
to this I love talking about this

817
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,880
shaping fire we're shaping

818
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,798
ourselves um what was your I'm sorry we

819
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,440
had started on um the the factors that

820
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,158
constitute a a challenging mindset a

821
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,759
time that you maybe wouldn't want to do

822
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,760
psychedelics right so

823
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,679
relatively like hopefully we're in in

824
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:38,600
decent relationships relatively speaking

825
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,679
right and we're able to kind of show up

826
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:44,839
in a way that is present and available

827
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,278
to receive the medicine right and I'm

828
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,959
still trying to figure out what that has

829
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:51,919
to do with shape but we are going to

830
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,360
start to be able to see our shape in a

831
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,278
new way right and if we are constantly

832
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,038
tense and stressed right we're going to

833
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:03,000
wear that and we're going to have to

834
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,440
spend time kind of like unwinding that

835
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,880
whereas like maybe if you've been doing

836
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,240
some yoga you've been opening up your

837
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:12,119
body you've been taking care of it like

838
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,039
like the B the the the body set is as

839
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:18,200
important as the mindset I guess is what

840
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:22,279
I'm trying to get at and

841
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:25,000
so yeah so when we're looking at

842
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,919
challenging experiences sometimes we do

843
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,480
need a reset I guess is what I'm getting

844
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:31,960
at right so sometimes people like I've

845
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,119
tried everything I'm in a bad place and

846
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,679
I something's got to change and

847
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,720
something's got to change now yeah like

848
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,079
sometimes people have to come to

849
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:42,439
psychedelics like that but hopefully you

850
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:44,720
can still carve out enough space right

851
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,599
that's another sematic word space so

852
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,959
that you can embody the space in its

853
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,838
fullness and be present for it be open

854
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,440
and not have to worry about the

855
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:55,078
pressures of the world shaping you in

856
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,280
such a way that you can't you can't

857
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:00,839
stand up straight in the open right on

858
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,960
so so that was the mindset and we we've

859
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,159
been talking about the Cornerstone of

860
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,480
psychedelic usage which is mindset and

861
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:10,159
settings so so now um let's talk a

862
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,199
little bit about setting which is um you

863
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:16,559
know often a little easier to make um uh

864
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,759
good than the mindset part so um since

865
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,358
you are the educator in this area let's

866
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,119
why don't we I'll I'll start by sending

867
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:24,559
giving you a general question here what

868
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,760
are some of the factors in uh

869
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:29,639
establishing a good setting for doing

870
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,640
psychedelics

871
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,359
it should probably be sweet right let's

872
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:42,519
just let's start let's

873
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:46,078
let's radiate out from the word

874
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:49,599
sweet right um it should be sweet and

875
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,880
nice and comfortable and safe right and

876
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,000
not too over rot although sometimes

877
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,880
people depending on the molecule

878
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,639
sometimes people like over rot you know

879
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,280
it's like we know what like the LSD

880
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:01,838
hippies of the 60s how they decorated

881
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,040
their spaces right they liked a lot of

882
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:05,639
stuff that was very vibrant and alive

883
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:08,199
and that's kind of fun sometimes it's a

884
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:11,440
little bubble gummy for some people but

885
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:14,239
sometimes it's really fun right and then

886
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,519
you know sometimes for depending on the

887
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,919
molecule sometimes psilocybin people

888
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:21,159
spend most of their time just inside

889
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,318
right like with their eyes closed right

890
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:27,000
they're journeying inward it makes um

891
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,960
it's less of an issue um one thing we do

892
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,159
know for sure it should be neat and

893
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,079
clean right um so we want something

894
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,519
that's neat and clean and you know has a

895
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,480
ceremonial energy to it in some ways

896
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:43,239
depending on whatever that means for you

897
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,440
um you know a sense of perhaps

898
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,519
sacredness right so you might want to

899
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,000
think about again like where is your

900
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,639
head at and what are you trying to

901
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,838
create like if you create more of a

902
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:55,519
temple atmosphere you might have more of

903
00:36:53,838 --> 00:37:00,519
a temple

904
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:05,119
experience right if you just sort of a

905
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:07,400
very um clean minimal kind of experience

906
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,519
well there's maybe not a lot for the

907
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,240
mind to project onto and it encourages

908
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,679
the mind to go inside but some of the

909
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,639
things that I might say is you decorate

910
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,039
it however you want and you talk to you

911
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:22,639
know you talk to your friends about that

912
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:24,039
and you know maybe you want a picture of

913
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,400
your kids maybe you want a picture of

914
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:27,960
your parents maybe you want a picture of

915
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,639
yourself as a kid depending on what you

916
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,358
want to work on maybe you want people

917
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:35,400
who are inspiring to

918
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:38,000
you um but you know what is kind of

919
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,920
important is that it's a

920
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,559
container right you kind of don't really

921
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,159
want strangers wandering

922
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:49,920
in right you want it to be neat and

923
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:52,440
clean and in many cases simple uh in

924
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,760
many cases ceremonial and you want to

925
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,079
kind of be sure that you're not going to

926
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:02,079
be bothered because that can be

927
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,680
um unpleasant yeah an intrusive

928
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,400
unexpected person suddenly can can

929
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:09,318
really change the direction uh not only

930
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,639
because we might have to some for a

931
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:15,480
moment try to present ourselves as you

932
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:17,440
know sober and regular when we're

933
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,119
actually having you know a pretty heavy

934
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,079
duty breakthrough moment and suddenly we

935
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,519
have to fake it for somebody that can

936
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:25,720
that can get messy um especially if that

937
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,960
person will be bothered if they figure

938
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:30,279
out that we're on psychedelics so you

939
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,159
know being being in a in a good location

940
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,640
a safe location that feels safe is

941
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,039
pretty essential and and I would also

942
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,159
include some of the the biological needs

943
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,079
too you know a source of water a

944
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:43,960
bathroom somewhere where there's not

945
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,280
going to be any threats um and some of

946
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,760
the other things that I've recommended

947
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,680
to people include a notepad and a pen

948
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,280
art supplies you know soft blankets to

949
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:57,199
soothe your nervous system um Tri trippy

950
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,040
items and and um sometimes movies that

951
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,000
are are your favorite um for me I have

952
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:04,960
always been very focused on nature I'm

953
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,440
not really an indoor psychedelics person

954
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,400
I'm a I'm a get outside where I know

955
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,440
that there's not going anybody around

956
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,960
and then you know start looking at bugs

957
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,920
in my celium and the weird the sun

958
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,159
glistening off the waves and and things

959
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:23,720
like that but everybody has their own um

960
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:26,000
their own style of of what you know

961
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:29,118
creates that that vessel or that that

962
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,280
safe space for them and and it's it is

963
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,838
really worth thinking about it in

964
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,359
advance and writing yourself some notes

965
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,318
and kind of like you're planning a

966
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:41,039
vacation for yourself so that when you

967
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:43,639
do um when when you do take take the

968
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,719
Psychedelic it's it's it's like oh

969
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:48,279
somebody who really cares about me

970
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:51,279
planned this experience for me and the

971
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:55,160
person who cares about you is

972
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,880
yourself yes and I do want to just note

973
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:00,399
that it might be different to depending

974
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,760
on your

975
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,519
dosage right so people might micro do

976
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,200
and then just go about their daily life

977
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,719
right right because it's it's sub

978
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,919
perceptual and then there is things that

979
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,679
slightly up from there you know is maybe

980
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,680
sometimes called the hro do where people

981
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:22,399
are taking maybe you know a little bit

982
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,679
more than a micro do to kind of make the

983
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,838
you know the leaves Shimmer a little but

984
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:29,118
they're not their cognition isn't

985
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:31,519
impaired that much or M sometimes it's

986
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,680
called a museum dose right this kind of

987
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,719
dose where you you would feel

988
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,960
comfortable going to a museum right

989
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,039
maybe a little bit maybe you take a

990
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,960
little bit more to go to a concert right

991
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:43,519
or maybe depending on how you roll maybe

992
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,639
you're taking quite a bit more to go to

993
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,880
a concert and then maybe we're going

994
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:52,759
towards something approaching

995
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,480
heroic right where being out in public

996
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,640
um wouldn't do it all right and maybe

997
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,838
you could be in a campground and nature

998
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:02,559
or things like that but you would

999
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:05,880
probably really want someone to look out

1000
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:08,119
for you a bit right like if you're in

1001
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,240
depend again depending on dosage and

1002
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:13,119
this is why General wisdom says start

1003
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:15,239
low and go slow yeah right so it's like

1004
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,200
okay I know that like if I do like I can

1005
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:20,879
pretty much manage I can make a fire not

1006
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:22,519
burn myself on this amount of this but

1007
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,200
you know if I'm really going to melt

1008
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:27,519
down you know maybe somebody wants to

1009
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:30,679
watch me if there's

1010
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,679
um a river rushing by you know because I

1011
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:34,318
might need them to tell me that like I'm

1012
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:36,598
not a fish

1013
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,079
yeah this might not be the best time to

1014
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,359
go for a swim my friend why don't we

1015
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,480
come on back over here for a little bit

1016
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,838
and look at the water or whatever yeah

1017
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,519
and this is also this brings us to you

1018
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:49,639
know regardless of you

1019
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,079
know you know it's hard to do this by

1020
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:53,039
yourself but if you're going to do this

1021
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:55,640
with with other people having some

1022
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,400
ground rules and agreements you know

1023
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:00,159
that's also good that when we're talking

1024
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:05,280
about containers right is sort of like

1025
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:07,480
ethical and relational containers of you

1026
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,280
know we're all going to we're all

1027

agreeing that we're staying in this area

1028
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,680
whether we're staying in this house or

nothing added real fish poop is

1071
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:48,000
extraordinarily complex not only are you

1072
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,599
adding the nitrogen phosphorus and

1073
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,480

with biological activity and

micronutrients

1078
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,680
when you add fish poop to your

1079
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,960
irrigation water you are adding life

force probiotics and active microbes

these microorganisms include a wealth of

various bacteria and protoo which

1083
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:13,880
further enhance nutrient availability

1084
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,239
for the plants because plants are

1085
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,559
limited by the absence of any essential

1086
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:20,279
micronutrient these Trace nutrients are

1087
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,000
the difference between having a decent

1088

you feel really proud of your efforts

fish poop is a naturally complete

poop one of the challenges with buying

1118
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,240
Autoflower seeds is that often you'll

1119
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:37,838
have as many different fenos as you will

1120
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:40,719
have seeds in a pack that can be fun

1121
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,960
sure but so many varieties in one pack

1122
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,838
is a sign of an immature seedline that

1123
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,519
hasn't been worked enough I prefer my

1124
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,519
autof flowers to be worked enough that

1125
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,480
each feno in the pack really captures

1126
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:54,400
the aspects that the breeder was

1127
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,119
intending this is why I recommend gnome

advertising we all know though that

1166
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,639
trying to reach a cannabis audience with

1167
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,440
a quality message is pretty difficult

1168
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:36,440
that's why many people choose to

1169
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,639
advertise on the shaping fire podcast

1170
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,519
advertising on this show allows us time

1171
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:43,039
to talk about your product service a

1172
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:45,559
brand in a way that really lets people

1173
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:48,400
know what sets your company apart from

1174
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:50,880
others bold people who own companies

1175
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,639
know that getting into relationship with

1176
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,160
their customers is essential and that is

1177
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:59,000
what we offer we will explain your

1178
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,879
service or product what sets it apart as

1179
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,159
desirable and help our audience get in

1180
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,440
contact with you it's pretty simple

1181
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:10,078
really advertising does not have to be

1182
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,240
all whizbang smoke and mirrors nowadays

1183
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,720
I find that people prefer just to be

1184
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,078
spoken to calmly accurately and with

1185
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,000
good intentions if you want to make your

1186
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:21,880
own commercial spot well you can do that

1187
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,760
too during these pandemic days

1188
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,280
conventions and cannabis events are

1189
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,800
pretty poorly attended but podcast

1190
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,720
listening is

1191
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,559

integration coach Daniel shankin so

1212
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:25,400
during the first set we talked a lot

1213
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:26,960
about um the mindset and the setting uh

1214
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,440
things that you definitely want to to

1215
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,920
consider uh in advance um you know we

1216
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,159
have t we talked a lot during the first

1217
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,599
set about how planning in advance is

1218
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:40,318
really a way to improve the likelihood

1219
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,440
that you'll have a a good and valuable

1220
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:45,039
and meaningful healing psychedelic

1221
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,599
experience and and and we're going to be

1222
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,558
talking a lot about that again here in

1223
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,920
second set but in a little different

1224
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:55,640
sort of detail so um let's start uh

1225
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,159
Daniel by I I want to um uh hit on

1226
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:58,879
something that you

1227
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:01,399
touched on briefly but I want to I want

1228
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,680
to drive it home a little bit more um

1229
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,280
the the physicality of it um you had

1230
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:09,159
mentioned that you know bringing a good

1231
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,079
calm body to the Psychedelic experience

1232
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:14,279
can be really helpful and I totally

1233
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:18,280
agree um but I also want to illustrate

1234
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:20,519
that a little bit more um for example um

1235
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,440
you know there are depending on which

1236
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:27,079
molecule that you take most of them will

1237
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,920
encourage your body to void itself and

1238
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:31,798
so one thing that um um people that I've

1239
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,400
worked with including myself have found

1240
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:38,159
value in over the years is uh to take a

1241
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:41,680
little psyllium husk uh the morning the

1242
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:43,519
the day before in the morning so that um

1243
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,159
whatever you may have eaten that is

1244
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:48,599
heavy you know maybe you had some steak

1245
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:51,039
or a burger or you know jalapeno poppers

1246
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:54,798
or something like that that can sit in

1247
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:59,039
your gut and and sometimes um during the

1248
00:50:54,798 --> 00:51:00,838
digestion um that that can take your

1249
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,119
attention can come away from the work

1250
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:05,558
that you're trying to do and start

1251
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:09,318
thinking about like the functioning of

1252
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:11,920
your body and so um uh you know make

1253
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:13,920
sure you're really hydrated as well

1254
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,838
because so I you know very often when

1255
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,039
we're having a psychedelic experience we

1256
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,719
will actually

1257
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:22,519
forget to drink water which is one of

1258
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:25,399
the good reasons to um to do psyched dos

1259
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:27,719
with friends because everybody can kind

1260
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,639
of help babysit each other to make sure

1261
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:33,519
that you are are um you know getting

1262
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:36,118
getting enough water and and such so um

1263
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:37,920
in addition to the yoga and the two

1264
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,400
things that I just mentioned Daniel do

1265
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,798
you have any other physical things to

1266
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,000
kind of round out that that that group

1267
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:45,000
of

1268
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:49,920
ideas I mean that's pretty good I mean

1269
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:51,719
you could also kind of just refrain from

1270
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,240
eating jalapeno poppers for a couple of

1271
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:59,159
days ahead of time that could

1272
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:02,358
work um you might want to oh I was once

1273
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:04,358
working with a guy who had his first

1274
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:06,199
psychedelic experience uh on a camping

1275
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:10,078
trip you know and he had a friend with

1276
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:12,759
him and they had an RV and when he came

1277
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,440
back he said to me in all

1278
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,960
seriousness good set and setting starts

1279
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,880
with clean

1280
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,720
socks right because he had been out in

1281
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,480
the woods and he the clothes he was

1282
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:25,879
wearing was were filthy and it he really

1283
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,798
felt it you know something that you

1284
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,280
might not notice as if you are just

1285
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:33,440
drinking a couple of beers becomes very

1286
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,519
obvious on you know 3 to five grams of

1287
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,838
mushrooms it is interesting how

1288
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,000
messiness and filth and anything that's

1289
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,798
gross is going to be usually really

1290
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,199
gross um and I'm I'm not sure why and it

1291
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:48,480
certainly isn't you know for everybody

1292
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:50,719
there are certainly um uh people who can

1293
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,318
get really curious about messy gross

1294
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:55,078
things as well but for whatever reason

1295
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:57,719
um the people I've interacted with and

1296
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:01,680
myself um we generally want to be

1297
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:03,598
comfortable and clean and orderly and

1298
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:06,838
you know just generally happy of body

1299
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,559
and spirit yeah well being curious about

1300
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:09,679
gross stuff and being covered in gross

1301
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,720
stuff are definitely two different

1302
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:12,639
things yeah that's a good point and you

1303
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:17,199
know we

1304
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:19,838
could we could make all kinds of kind of

1305
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:23,279
cosmic High woo ideas about why that is

1306
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:26,519
but you know it's it's pretty much

1307
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,280
so let's talk a little bit about um the

1308
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,798
kind of preparations to make

1309
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,880
additionally um if you're going to do

1310
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:36,199
this experience with friends and for me

1311
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,240
I'm I'm very grateful that when I got

1312
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:42,598
turned on to psychedelics in college um

1313
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:44,879
it was in a peer group of people and so

1314
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:47,318
you know most of my first experiences

1315
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,880
were you know three to seven people and

1316
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:53,279
and we had a u a big Forest next to my

1317
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,480
uh University and and and off we would

1318
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,280
go and we would have these fantastic

1319
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,798
days and come back and exhausted and

1320
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,880
dirty and take showers and then you know

1321
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:05,318
kind of have this Afterglow period in

1322
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,599
the evening um the the first the first

1323
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:09,199
thing with friends that I'll get us

1324
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,079
started with is to um you know kind of

1325
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:13,879
work with everybody to compare your

1326
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:16,559
plans and your locations because if you

1327
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:19,720
all get together on on the day of your

1328
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:23,559
experience and um you have different

1329
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:25,279
intentions um either a um some people

1330
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:27,160
might have some hard feelings about it

1331
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,680
which isn't a great way to go into an

1332
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:33,078
experience or which can sometimes be

1333
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:35,279
equally as as detrimental um your your

1334
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:38,240
original fellowship if you will of

1335
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,720
people who are going to um be together

1336
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:41,919
people want to do different things and

1337
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:44,480
so they split off and so your your group

1338
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,119
of six comes off into a a three a two

1339
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,358
and a one and um that's going to be a

1340
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:54,160
very different experience than if

1341
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:56,400
everybody has a shared plan um uh

1342
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,719
another one is uh and and I'm hoping

1343
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,880
maybe you speak to this a little bit

1344
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:03,798
Daniel is um we always had like an

1345
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:07,160
emergency signal or word and and not

1346
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:10,119
emergency meaning like there's danger it

1347
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:13,960
it was it was um usually a signal or

1348
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:15,559
word that meant I I I could there is a

1349
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,639
moment that I really could use you to

1350
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:20,040
pull your [ __ ] together for a moment so

1351
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:22,000
we can talk about something that's like

1352
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:25,038
somewhat relevant or serious for a

1353
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,838
moment like can can I get your attention

1354
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,720
and um you know I I've never really

1355
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:32,920
found a really good way to talk about

1356
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:35,719
that with people to to to delineate

1357
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:38,519
between like a safe word for an

1358
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:40,719
emergency and a signal that I need your

1359
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:42,759
attention um H How would how would you

1360
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:44,078
go about that with folks I like that

1361
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,400
that's really

1362
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,640
interesting um and before we get to that

1363
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,318
because I'm going to think about that in

1364
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,598
the background while I mention this all

1365
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:55,639
right um there's been a phenomenon

1366
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,920
recently right so you grew up with your

1367
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:58,318
friends and they were your friends and

1368
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,519
you did psychedelics with your friends

1369
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:04,440
and that's that works cuz they're your

1370
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:05,759
friends um so recently more and more

1371
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,240
people are coming into the Psychedelic

1372
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,720
space and they're not even kids they're

1373
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:11,279
grown-ups right so they're adults you

1374
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:13,000
know they're not teenagers or college

1375
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,079
kids or whatever they're they're these

1376
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,440
adults and there was a and they're

1377
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,720
interested and they're curious and

1378
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,838
they're excited about this also then

1379
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:25,318
there was a

1380
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:27,159
pandemic right which means that people

1381
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:29,000
were kind of isolated

1382
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:31,719
and it also meant that people were

1383
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,079
becoming friendly with people from all

1384
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:37,919
over the place on Zoom that they didn't

1385
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:40,839
actually know right and then they think

1386
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:44,440
because they've had you know a half a

1387
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:47,639
dozen Zoom whatevers with these people

1388
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:50,639
um that they're Soul

1389
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:52,318
family and they get together and they

1390
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:55,078
take psychedelics together and they

1391
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:58,558
realize really quickly that they're

1392
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,760
not and and so you know people kind of

1393
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,240
take for

1394
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,880
granted um real relationship and real

1395
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:07,679
connection you know the ability to kind

1396
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,480
of like smell somebody you know to know

1397
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:13,000
what your friends smell like to kind of

1398
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,880
be there when you are weird together at

1399
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,880
a restaurant you know like like all of

1400
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:21,599
these kinds of things that are really um

1401
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,838
intimate relationship things that are

1402
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,318
missing because you just log in with

1403
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:26,920
somebody for an hour or something and

1404
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:29,558
you're on like a group signal chat with

1405
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:32,798
them group WhatsApp group right and

1406
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:35,400
that's different than being in an

1407
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:38,318
intimate psychedelic space with people

1408
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:41,079
so you want to actually be careful

1409
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:43,558
perhaps about like who you're doing this

1410
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:45,680
with like are these really your friends

1411
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,960
like is is there a container are there

1412
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:51,279
agreements do you have a plan like and

1413
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:54,880
that can help create an intentionality

1414
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,160
that can help build that Bond MH right

1415
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,720
but to do it kind of

1416
00:57:57,159 --> 00:58:02,279
off the cuff and loose and pretend do

1417
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:04,480
like a pretend ceremony because what I

1418
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,559
see sometimes is people like oh I've

1419
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,880
been to ceremonies I know how they work

1420
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:11,240
and like it was good but you know we're

1421
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,720
we're just going to be chill and we

1422
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:15,719
don't actually need to have the group

1423
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:17,519
agreements and we don't need to kind of

1424
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:20,038
ring the bell and set the circle or

1425
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,960
whatever it is because we I've done that

1426
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:24,760
before you have to do it you have to do

1427
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,920
it every time yeah right like it's it's

1428
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,440
a practice it would be like I don't need

1429
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:34,559
to breathe today I breathed yesterday

1430
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,720
MH and so you know keeping in mind you

1431
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,599
know are your friends really your

1432
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:41,199
friends like are you setting the stage

1433
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:44,119
properly and do you have the agreements

1434
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:47,759
so as far as this thing where you're

1435
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:50,880
having um safe words and things like

1436
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,640
that I mean this comes back to like do

1437
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,960
you do you know your people because I

1438
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:59,358
sort of feel like um

1439
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,838
with my friends who are really my

1440
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:06,199
friends I can communicate an awful lot

1441
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:09,719
with a cough a pause or a side

1442
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:12,358
eye right like if I need something like

1443
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:13,798
I can just you know I can kind of look

1444
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:14,960
out of the corner of my eye at my buddy

1445
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:17,400
and go

1446
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,639
like you know and he'll be like hey Dan

1447
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,960
you know let me show you something over

1448
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:24,318
here in the kitchen yeah you know and

1449
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,599
then and then we can have a thing but

1450
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:29,318
you know I like the idea that like

1451
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:33,480
just introducing that is a great idea

1452
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:36,279
and I think the really the theme Here is

1453
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:39,960
uh making things explicit right we all

1454
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,839
have a very transpar yeah yeah clear

1455
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,480
transparent explicit we all have a lot

1456
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:46,599
of assumptions about how the thing is

1457
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:51,079
supposed to go and you know are they the

1458
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:52,798
same assumptions yeah and you know as we

1459
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:55,280
have talked about where you know your

1460
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:58,239
ceremony is your ceremony that you

1461
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,359
designed and and and and and your

1462
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:02,318
environment is your environment the same

1463
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:04,400
thing would be the safe word or the

1464
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:06,279
signal and and since I have some

1465
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,039
experience with this I I will also take

1466
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,960
it a step further and say um in my

1467
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:14,520
experience we have found that safe words

1468
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,960
are easily forgotten and sometimes a

1469
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:20,079
safe hand signal is more easily

1470
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,920
remembered and and one of the ones that

1471
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,960
that I used to use back when I was a

1472
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,200
young man was we decided that thumbs up

1473
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,720
was not a good one because we we did

1474
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:31,798
thumbs up often just to be happy and

1475
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:33,279
thumbs down well that's not really good

1476
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:35,559
CU that that kind of sets off your

1477
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:40,039
adrenaline and so what we would do is we

1478
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:42,280
would actually do like um uh horizontal

1479
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,960
um thumbs pointed out and we just put

1480
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:47,599
like the sides of our hands together and

1481
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,440
it it's kind of a fun hand motion to

1482
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:54,318
make and anybody in the group who saw it

1483
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:57,200
knew exactly what this hand motion meant

1484
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:59,000
and um a good example it where where I

1485
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:00,879
was not trying to well actually it

1486
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,838
wasn't me who was giving the sign but in

1487
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,680
in this is my story um uh we want to get

1488
01:01:04,838 --> 01:01:08,798
attention and we want people to pay

1489
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:10,879
attention but we don't necessarily want

1490
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,838
to give people the idea that there's

1491
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,960
something dangerous and and maybe

1492
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:17,519
influence their trip and and a good

1493
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:20,240
example was that um one of our friends

1494
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,400
stepped on was barefoot and she stepped

1495
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,358
on some

1496
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,960
glass and she needed just some basic

1497
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:29,400
first aid and and um it was something

1498
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,720
that we could provide within our group

1499
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,720
um because you know we were we were all

1500
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:35,558
kind of outdoorsy people right so we we

1501
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:37,879
we all had our 10 Essentials with us

1502
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:40,798
when we were out in the forest but but

1503
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,920
we we wanted to come together to heal

1504
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:46,038
our friend we didn't want our other

1505
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,960
friends to drift off in the forest and

1506
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:50,000
we kind of wanted to work together to

1507
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,720
apply the first aid right cuz you know

1508
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,400
when you're on psychedelics things are a

1509
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:56,439
little odd to think through and so so

1510
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,639
she gave us the hands signal and we're

1511
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,639
all like came together we're like hey

1512
01:01:57,639 --> 01:02:01,118
what's up you know and then she showed

1513
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:04,838
us and we were all kind of like a moment

1514
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:07,039
like oh blood which and so but then we

1515
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:09,159
all just kind of sat down together and

1516
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,319
we we you know went through the steps we

1517
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:14,358
we cleaned the wound we bandaged it we

1518
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:16,358
chatted with her so she understood that

1519
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:18,078
this was not the end of her good trip

1520
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:20,078
and things were still fine and she was

1521
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,559
safe and we were with her and we were

1522
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,160
going to slightly change our plan about

1523
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,839
how far we were going to walk so so she

1524
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:30,118
didn't feel you know but it was all as

1525
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:32,599
soon as we all saw the hand motion we

1526
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:35,318
all understood that oh we all need to

1527
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:37,960
come together for like a little meeting

1528
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:39,960
and um and I I recommend that people

1529
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:42,760
include that when when they're working

1530
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,798
with a group I dig it yeah I dig it and

1531
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,960
what you're reminding me of actually is

1532
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:50,400
is Disney World oh

1533
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:54,039
um there's a there's a non Seer this

1534
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,400
should be good it's um so what they have

1535
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:58,319
now like I I I haven't been to

1536
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,000
Disneyland in in for since I was a

1537
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:03,239
little guy um but now they had to give

1538
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,719
you like these uh wristbands with

1539
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:07,159
microchips in them right and to like get

1540
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:09,278
on the rides and to get in everything

1541
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:11,719
you just kind of swipe your wristband

1542
01:03:09,278 --> 01:03:14,400
and then what they realize is like like

1543
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:16,278
if the wristband works right like it it

1544
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,200
flashes green it's like okay you paid

1545
01:03:16,278 --> 01:03:21,000
for your meal green if the wristband

1546
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,318
isn't working or like you're go trying

1547
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,400
to go somewhere you're not supposed to

1548
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:30,358
go it flashes blue I believe

1549
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,720
because red is too dangerous oh like

1550
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:33,358
they don't want people they feel like

1551
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:35,480
they decided that red would harsh

1552
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:38,598
people's mellow too much yeah I I dck

1553
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:39,880
that yeah and um I just I think it's

1554
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:42,920
really funny that you know you don't

1555
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:45,720
want the hand signal to be too alerting

1556
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,240
int you know alarming alarming yeah

1557
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:49,118
that's a better word yeah we just want

1558
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:51,919
your attention yeah yeah I mean it's

1559
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:54,000
like sure we know how to like bandage a

1560
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,798
simple wound this is the most natural

1561
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
thing we're just friends taking care of

1562
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:00,960
friends and that's an attitude that you

1563
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,079
know if there's any you know guides

1564
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,000
listening as well that you know we want

1565
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:07,519
to take an attitude of like this is the

1566
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,119
most natural thing things are okay we're

1567
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:11,639
just folks hanging out and honestly it

1568
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:15,119
ended up being a very beautiful

1569
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:19,118
experience I mean uh the there were five

1570
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:22,640
of us on this day and um it

1571
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:25,880
was the five of us working together to

1572
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:28,480
heal one of the five of us and all kind

1573
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:31,000
of gently speaking with each other and

1574
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,880
and doing the first aid and and and

1575
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,559
giving her healing like conversation at

1576
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:39,000
the same time it probably was healing

1577
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:41,160
things in us at the same time as we were

1578
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,239
giving her first aid like healing Us in

1579
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:45,798
the sense of we're doing a psychedelic

1580
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:48,598
experience to heal emotional wounds or

1581
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:51,639
whatever um us coming together I'm sure

1582
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:53,400
we were all you know getting getting

1583
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:55,920
good stuff out of that I mean to the

1584
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:59,838
point that I remember it now like what

1585
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:03,798
years later right yeah yeah I mean just

1586
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:05,880
to know like like the experience of of

1587
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:09,639
competence and

1588
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:11,318
care right of like I can we can do this

1589
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,838
we are people who take care of each

1590
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:14,679
other and love one another and we show

1591
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:16,838
up for each other and do what needs to

1592
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:17,919
be done you know because like it's a

1593
01:05:16,838 --> 01:05:20,278
it's a little thing it's a little

1594
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,880
Band-Aid but you know on the right

1595
01:05:20,278 --> 01:05:25,119
molecule like that's an Epic Quest you

1596
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,960
know even though we're saying oh yeah

1597
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:30,640
it's chill cool like you know we make

1598
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,159
things big in our minds yeah and you

1599
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:34,960
know healing our

1600
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:37,038
friends you know is it's a big deal like

1601
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,079
it's it's the most it's the biggest deal

1602
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:43,079
there can be really yeah um it's it's

1603
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,559
like at the core of Being Human yeah um

1604
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:46,920
one of the other things that tends to

1605
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:50,160
happen is um you know very often people

1606
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:53,000
will get separated um One Way or Another

1607
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:55,159
and um you know it's it's it's it's kind

1608
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,519
of a tossup with who the people that

1609
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:59,558
you're doing it with because we all have

1610
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:01,559
cell phones and so if we get separated

1611
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:03,359
it is easy to go grab your cell phone

1612
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:06,839
and say hey I lost you where are you

1613
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:08,719
right but at the same time um I've been

1614
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:11,480
with people where everyone's decided we

1615
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:13,719
want to turn off our cell phones so that

1616
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:16,079
people who might harsh our Vibe don't

1617
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:21,358
call us and interrupt what we've got

1618
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:24,200
going down right and so um uh in in the

1619
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,519
situations when we don't have the phone

1620
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:29,078
um I I usually work with folks and say

1621
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:31,239
hey if you get separated from the group

1622
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:33,680
um we will meet at this whatever

1623
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:36,118
location and and when we realize you're

1624
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:38,078
not there um we will all head to that

1625
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:40,880
location and then we will continue our

1626
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,720
experience from that location um I'm

1627
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:46,000
sure this has come across your plate

1628
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:49,118
many times um it's a story as old as

1629
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,838
time um I'm serious U can we do history

1630
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,960
again yeah do it do it so should we do

1631
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:56,119
kind of modern psychedelic history or

1632
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,880
archaic tribal history

1633
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:01,480
archaic sounds more fun let's go there

1634
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:03,880
all right we'll start there so um when

1635
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:06,880
you go through places like the Alti

1636
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:09,680
mountains and Siberia and just places

1637
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,680
where there are vast fields and steps

1638
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:16,519
and hills and mountains you often come

1639
01:07:12,679 --> 01:07:18,838
across big stones that are vertical like

1640
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:20,838
just plopped in the middle of a field

1641
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:24,558
right these kind of like obelisque Kon

1642
01:07:20,838 --> 01:07:27,199
kind of things and you know the the

1643
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,359
scholars believe like this is how people

1644
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:33,199
oriented right like if you needed to

1645
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:35,759
meet Nomad like you're a nomad right in

1646
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:38,078
in the Siberian mountains right and you

1647
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,799
need to meet people we're like okay on

1648
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:42,160
the solstice I'll meet you over three

1649
01:07:39,798 --> 01:07:45,000
Hills at that stone yeah at the stone

1650
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:48,399
that looks like a horse or whatever yeah

1651
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,838
and so people were have been orienting

1652
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:54,119
themselves um forever right to try and

1653
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:56,038
find their place in space right which is

1654
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:57,318
good cuz again you know like

1655
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:59,440
so our

1656
01:07:57,318 --> 01:08:01,318
minds we're we're taking our minds out

1657
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,039
into space right we're we're

1658
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:06,199
intentionally disorienting ourselves

1659
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:08,200
right and this is one of the reasons why

1660
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:09,278
having a good intention is key right

1661
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:11,239
we're talking about that Mantra

1662
01:08:09,278 --> 01:08:13,318
intention you can think of that Mantra

1663
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:16,960
intention kind of like a stone in a

1664
01:08:13,318 --> 01:08:19,798
field like I'm lost in the in in Siberia

1665
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,480
where's my stone right and then to have

1666
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:25,640
something like that for the group is it

1667
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:27,838
only stands to reason um I don't know if

1668
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,000
you've ever have you ever um seen a dead

1669
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:34,278
show at the Spectrum not at the Spectrum

1670
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,439
um so back in the day um there was a

1671
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:38,880
Rocky statue at the Spectrum in Philly

1672
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:42,039
right there was the movie Rocky the

1673
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:45,279
boxer yeah sure and they you know they

1674
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:47,519
made a statue for him in the movie but

1675
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:51,799
then the statue also existed in real

1676
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:53,880
life and so they put it at the Spectrum

1677
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:55,719
for a while which is you know a Philly

1678
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,920
place where the dead would play mhm and

1679
01:08:55,719 --> 01:09:00,439
so that's where we'd meet our friends if

1680
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,679
you get lost we'll meet you at the Rocky

1681
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:06,759
statue that's great and so we would not

1682
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:08,679
you know it's natural in our bodies you

1683
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:11,719
know it's natural in our community

1684
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:13,440
Spirit to say you know we say it to kids

1685
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:16,279
you know if you get lost this is you

1686
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:19,238
know meet me here by this thing you know

1687
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:23,679
find an adult find another mom and tell

1688
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:25,798
her to take you to this place right and

1689
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,399
so you know that that's is the most

1690
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:29,838
natural thing in the world that we have

1691
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:31,719
been doing for thousands of years is

1692
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:35,399
picking meeting

1693
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:37,480
places a corar to that that um you know

1694
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:40,879
really applies differently in different

1695
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:42,639
situations is um letting somebody know

1696
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,199
what's going on who isn't going to be

1697
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,798
with y'all so you know if if you're if

1698
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,919
you're going to do a psychedelic and

1699
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:51,560
stay around the house well you know that

1700
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:53,880
may not be as important but if you're

1701
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:56,239
going out in the forest right or I live

1702
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:59,239
on an island so you know it is not

1703
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:01,000
uncommon for people to decide that that

1704
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:03,158
we're going to get in a boat and go to

1705
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,439
one of the Lesser populated Islands near

1706
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:08,719
me in the Puget Sound or which is you

1707
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:12,639
know much more of a trip um pun intended

1708
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:14,960
and um that if you are doing anything

1709
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,640
where you're going to be leaving home

1710
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,719
and and and it is a good thing to let

1711
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:24,039
somebody know who's not going with you

1712
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:26,039
that y'all are doing this and and and

1713
01:10:24,039 --> 01:10:28,439
even if you're sure nothing's really

1714
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:30,880
going to go wrong where where that

1715
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:33,639
person would need to know there's almost

1716
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,920
always somebody in the group who is a

1717
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,560
little uncomfortable with some aspect

1718
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,640
and they're they're just happy to know

1719
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,600
that there is somebody who's not with

1720
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:46,600
the you know four or six or whatever of

1721
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,760
you um on the outside who isn't um you

1722
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,000
know tripping or isn't experiencing the

1723
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:53,119
Psychedelic sometimes people need to

1724
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,640
have a sober person on the outside that

1725
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:56,840
they can call if they if they start to

1726
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,679
kind of slide off and and start to

1727
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,880
potentially have a a troubling

1728
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:02,719
experience so you know they can be they

1729
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,159
can be used in lots of different ways

1730
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:07,719
but I'm a strong proponent of of having

1731
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:10,799
there be a you know a phone a friend out

1732
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:14,279
there just so there's somebody who isn't

1733
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,920
on a psychedelic in case they are

1734
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:18,840
needed yeah that's great and again you

1735
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:21,800
know back to the idea of sitters that

1736
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:25,440
person might even be with you in the

1737
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,039
house mhm like they might be they might

1738
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:31,158
be traveling with you at the concert you

1739
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:34,039
know there there is you know the idea of

1740
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:37,519
sort of like the mom you know you know

1741
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:39,639
the the the the the denm mother of sorts

1742
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,679
and you know it could be not to gender

1743
01:11:39,639 --> 01:11:43,840
anybody but you know it it could be

1744
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:46,639
whatever but you know somebody who is

1745
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:49,920
there and they are you know making tea

1746
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:52,319
and they're sort of there if you need

1747
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,800
them and does everybody have a blanket

1748
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:57,079
and okay it's hard for you guys to pick

1749
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,719
the music right now I will do that and

1750
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:00,600
that sort of thing yeah the way you just

1751
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,000
described it sounded really nice

1752
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,280
actually I I might actually like that in

1753
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,800
my regular

1754
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:09,198
life yeah yeah um and you know it

1755
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,679
doesn't mean that the that the person

1756
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:13,559
needs to you know be right there because

1757
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,679
very often when people are having a

1758
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,159
psychedelic experience it becomes very

1759
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,480
intimate and they really only want the

1760
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:20,238
people who are high there um but it's

1761
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:21,839
you know if you're going to have

1762
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:23,319
somebody it's it's perfectly fine that

1763
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,000
they're in another room reading or

1764
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:27,198
something and if and if you need them

1765
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,960
they they're there and if not maybe they

1766
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:31,119
just like go through the room you know

1767
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,800
every half hour and just like make sure

1768
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:35,000
everybody's doing good you know it

1769
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,119
really just depends on on everybody's

1770
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,479
Comfort level you can really design this

1771
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:42,319
however you want this is this is your

1772
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:44,479
adventure this is your experience and

1773
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:45,960
and all Daniel and I are doing are are

1774
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:47,919
pointing out a whole bunch of best

1775
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:51,119
practices that work for lots of

1776
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:54,199
different kinds of people um yeah

1777
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:56,359
sometimes I like to think of a sitter as

1778
01:12:54,198 --> 01:12:59,079
kind of like

1779
01:12:56,359 --> 01:13:01,639
um Alfred from

1780
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:04,119
Batman like you're I like that yeah

1781
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:05,239
you're in the dark right you're like you

1782
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:07,679
imagine you're laying there with your

1783
01:13:05,238 --> 01:13:10,759
eyes closed right you're in the dark um

1784
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,760
saving the universe and then you come

1785
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:14,119
out of the dark and you open your eyes

1786
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,600
and he's there and he said would you

1787
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:17,800
like some tea

1788
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,440
sir and the thing is he's been there

1789
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,920
like if you follow the history of Alfred

1790
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:22,479
like Alfred used to go on missions with

1791
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,920
Batman he would like he was the driver

1792
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:28,839
for a while oh you know he knows how it

1793
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,359
goes like you know he can he can um

1794
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,440
stitch up like you're saying like Alfred

1795
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:33,639
one of the things Alfred does is he

1796
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:36,479
stitches up Batman right fixes his

1797
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:37,960
wounds and offers him counsel you know

1798
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:40,919
if he needs

1799
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:44,439
it so I've got two more topics before we

1800
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:49,239
go to Commercial and and one is um there

1801
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:51,319
are some classic foods and beverages

1802
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:54,279
that just seem to work well with

1803
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:58,039
psychedelic experience for so you know

1804
01:13:54,279 --> 01:14:00,359
water coconut water fruit is almost

1805
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:03,079
always fun especially like bright citrus

1806
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:05,359
fruit oh my goodness gracious what what

1807
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:07,840
are some in your experience that are are

1808
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:10,799
you know loow hanging fruit for being a

1809
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:13,719
good U good thing to have along yeah I

1810
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:16,039
like a nice fruit plate M um I I

1811
01:14:13,719 --> 01:14:18,600
generally

1812
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:22,359
like yeah I like a nice fruit plate and

1813
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:24,079
and so often berries and citrus and I I

1814
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:26,000
like berries a lot you know they're

1815
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,519
they're bite-sized um you have to check

1816
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,079
because not everybody likes every Berry

1817
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:35,920
um I like dark chocolate a lot I think

1818
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:39,198
dark chocolate is great um I like

1819
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:41,399
cashews personally quite a bit so you

1820
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:44,879
know the I I really

1821
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:48,119
like um the

1822
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:51,319
presentation as well so you know there's

1823
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:55,960
there's a difference between having just

1824
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:59,039
a plastic bin of berries like over by

1825
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:03,239
the sink versus like taking a really

1826
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:05,920
nice plate and AR making a mandala of

1827
01:15:03,238 --> 01:15:08,799
treats honestly if you could spend your

1828
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:11,199
entire trip making that mandala of

1829
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,279
snacks Well it Well actually we were

1830
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:15,759
talking about preparation yeah sure it's

1831
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:18,639
a really nice preparation activity

1832
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:21,079
because it's creative and it's nurturing

1833
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:23,480
and it's focused right and it's

1834
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:26,399
intentional so you're starting off your

1835
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:28,919
journey by okay like I'm here to I'm

1836
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:30,479
taking care of my future self yeah and

1837
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,319
you know I'm just kind of bringing my

1838
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:34,759
attention you know whatever I was doing

1839
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:37,079
in the world now I'm creating this kind

1840
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,760
of little work of art this little edible

1841
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:41,760
work of art and there's okay there's the

1842
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,520
chocolate and then you know maybe

1843
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,119
there's olives I don't know some people

1844
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,440
like that you know sometimes it's it's

1845
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:49,559
nice to have something that's like a

1846
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:51,238
little in congruous mhm well because

1847
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,440
then you can hit all the flavors here's

1848
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:55,678
my sweet here's my Citrus here's my

1849
01:15:53,439 --> 01:16:00,559
salty Olive whatever

1850
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:04,039
yeah that kind of thing um um you know

1851
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:06,120
mushrooms seem to like uh well you know

1852
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:09,279
you might have like a drinking chocolate

1853
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:10,479
as well like cacao could be nice um you

1854
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:12,800
know you you'd want to know if that

1855
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:15,479
would disturb somebody's stomach but um

1856
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,639
Cacao is nice ginger tea is really nice

1857
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:20,238
crystallized ginger is really

1858
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:25,239
nice um you know you certainly don't

1859
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:27,238
want to have to do much prep MH not in

1860
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:30,519
the moment exactly you want to you want

1861
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:32,079
to do it well in advance yeah yeah and

1862
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,840
also you know with most psychedelics

1863
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:37,359
most psychedelics in the short term are

1864
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:39,480
appetite suppressants too and so um you

1865
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,960
know when when you're you know going up

1866
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:44,759
and up that's not usually when you're

1867
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,760
going to get hungry after you have you

1868
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,760
know some time you you might get a

1869
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:51,920
little snacky which is what we're kind

1870
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:55,159
of talking about here but um it while

1871
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:57,840
it's not never it is atypical my

1872
01:16:55,158 --> 01:16:59,679
experience that when you're in the in

1873
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,159
the throws of a psychedelic experience

1874
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:06,199
that you'll be very hungry now when you

1875
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:08,559
come down you will often be hungry and I

1876
01:17:06,198 --> 01:17:11,678
think it's a good idea to plan in

1877
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,880
advance what your you know and end of

1878
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,399
trip meal is going to be like so so at

1879
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:18,400
least you know where the food's going to

1880
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:20,599
come from um because when you're when

1881
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:23,319
you're coming down you might be tired

1882
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,719
and you might be feeling glowy um you

1883
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:28,359
might not want to be making you know

1884
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:30,880
like serious food decisions that time so

1885
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:33,000
maybe maybe you already have it or or

1886
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,639
maybe you have a plan that oh at the end

1887
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,840
we're going to order delivered food from

1888
01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:40,480
our favorite place or whatever um like

1889
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:43,760
most everything we've been talking about

1890
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:46,158
you can do it however you want um but

1891
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,360
it's good to plan this out ahead of time

1892
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:51,119
especially if it's one of your first

1893
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:54,319
times so that the whole thing just goes

1894
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:57,679
well for you right and and people do you

1895
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:59,198
you want to be mindful that and this

1896
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:02,039
goes with setting I'll go back to

1897
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:04,678
setting as well that what is appetizing

1898
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:07,319
to you in your regular life might not be

1899
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:10,079
good point um whereas you know you might

1900
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:12,399
be a person like uh U psychedelics have

1901
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:15,319
have minted many

1902
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:17,879
vegetarians you know who were who were

1903
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:21,359
very comfortable just eating whatever

1904
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,960
and then they tried to eat whatever and

1905
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:25,359
it wasn't working for them

1906
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:29,198
anymore um they was like oh that's

1907
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:32,039
that's not that's not it um so you know

1908
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:33,638
in general one of the really cool things

1909
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:36,198
about psychedelics that I think a lot of

1910
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:38,199
people don't recognize you know with all

1911
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:41,198
the stigma and stuff is that in many

1912
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:43,960
cases they make people kind of more

1913
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:47,079
wholesome in a lot of ways right they

1914
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:48,198
make people Kinder and more gentle and

1915
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:52,359
more

1916
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:55,039
attentive um and perhaps wanting to um

1917
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:58,359
have fun in simpler ways right eat simp

1918
01:18:55,039 --> 01:19:01,600
foods not always of course but you know

1919
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:04,238
that that's one of the things and you

1920
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,920
know on that note well going back to

1921
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:08,759
setting is sometimes the things that

1922
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:12,158
people think are trippy when they're

1923
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:15,039
sober are not trippy when they're trippy

1924
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:16,198
also true yeah like you know like like

1925
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:18,479
sometimes there'll be like you know

1926
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:22,238
cheap plastic crap with flashing lights

1927
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:25,439
in it is not as interesting as like a

1928
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:28,279
smooth gray rock yeah

1929
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,198
well it's odd too because very often you

1930
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:32,840
see the plastic and you're like this is

1931
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:34,238
an unreal thing you know it's it's it

1932
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,880
you just don't really know how you're

1933
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:39,559
going to um interpret things and I don't

1934
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:43,480
know I I think that there are reasons

1935
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:46,120
why people tend towards um natural

1936
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:48,479
things when they're on

1937
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:50,439
psychedelics yeah yeah yeah I mean there

1938
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:55,879
is a really there's a cool book called

1939
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:58,559
psychedelic prayers by Timothy ly he um

1940
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:01,800
had I think like seven copies of the Dao

1941
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:04,480
de ching and a vial of acid and I think

1942
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,000
he was in India he fled the country and

1943
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:09,959
he read the da ching and he took the

1944
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,679
acid and he wrote psychelic prayers and

1945
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,880
one of the things that it talks about in

1946
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:14,639
there are the things that are nice to

1947
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:17,440
have

1948
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:20,119
around you know and he um I'm seeing if

1949
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:22,960
I have it nearby uh we can put it in the

1950
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:26,800
show notes I I don't have it nearby but

1951
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:30,600
you know something like handwoven cloth

1952
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:33,719
right uncarved wood right raw

1953
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:37,440
rocks right he said in in his poem he

1954
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:42,119
says bread bread cheese and

1955
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:44,960
wine right um anything that is over 500

1956
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:46,800
years old right when you have like like

1957
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,158
an ancient artifact that can be really

1958
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,560
fun yeah um and then of course he ends

1959
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:52,599
by saying of course it's best to be

1960
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:55,400
secluded in nature

1961
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:59,000
right um but just simp

1962
01:20:55,399 --> 01:21:00,759
natural things you know can go a long

1963
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,399
way

1964
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,520
yeah

1965
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:06,799
handmade right things that have care in

1966
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,159
them you can see that's an interesting

1967
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,719
thing it's like one of those superpowers

1968
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:11,279
you know in the shows that sometimes

1969
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:13,079
there's a superhero and they can touch a

1970
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:15,559
thing and they know it's history right

1971
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:17,800
yes like a Tripper knows if there's care

1972
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:20,560
in a

1973
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:23,239
thing so the last thing I want to touch

1974
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:26,120
on here is is just the preparation of

1975
01:21:23,238 --> 01:21:28,638
the drug itself um I think it's always

1976
01:21:26,119 --> 01:21:31,439
good um whether you're on your own or

1977
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:34,319
with a group to be really clear well in

1978
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:37,039
advance on what your dosages and to

1979
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:40,158
pre-make it so that you're not debating

1980
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:42,600
on your dosage or preparing it right

1981
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:44,559
there at the last moment because you

1982
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,440
know some of these molecules they you

1983
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,199
know you really have to do it with care

1984
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:50,519
and slowly if you're going to be making

1985
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:51,519
a capsule or you know you want to be

1986
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,400
clear if you're going to do it with

1987
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,480
friends are we going to make a tea or

1988
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:58,879
are we going to you know eat the

1989
01:21:55,479 --> 01:22:00,439
mushroom fruit itself um I I I

1990
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,279
discourage people from leaving that to

1991
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:04,638
the last

1992
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:07,519
minute yeah I mean

1993
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:09,800
I am cautious about answering this too

1994
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:13,440
much because I don't want it to seem

1995
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:14,520
like too much advice about like that

1996
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:18,519
kind of

1997
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:20,960
stuff but you know test kits are

1998
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:24,000
available scales are

1999
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,119
available you know um Guy aroid is

2000
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,399
available

2001
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:29,039
right you know there are many reference

2002
01:22:27,399 --> 01:22:31,399
materials so that you can know what a

2003
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,840
thing is supposed to do right you can

2004
01:22:31,399 --> 01:22:35,000
decide based on the effects that you

2005
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:37,239
want that some things lean more towards

2006
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,079
one thing or lead towards another right

2007
01:22:37,238 --> 01:22:41,599
guidel dosage guidelines are online

Shango Los and my guest today is

2133
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:22,520
psychedelic integration coach Daniel

2134
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:24,880
shankin so my friends here we are at the

2135
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:27,400
final set and we are going to talk about

2136
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,840
integration integration is actually the

2137
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:32,439
first reason why I became interested in

2138
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:34,279
your teaching because integration is a

2139
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:38,079
part of the process that I am least

2140
01:27:34,279 --> 01:27:40,639
familiar with and by watching your um

2141
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:42,840
your Tik Tok and Instagram accounts um I

2142
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,480
started really getting a good sense of

2143
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:47,199
the integration I was doing right and

2144
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:49,799
the integration I could be improving on

2145
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:51,799
and the quality of the advice that I was

2146
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:54,639
offering to others has absolutely

2147
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:57,239
increased since um since I started uh

2148
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,960
listening to your insights so so let's

2149
01:27:57,238 --> 01:28:01,198
that's amazing to hear thank you oh good

2150
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,239
excellent so so let's start with with

2151
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:06,599
just asking you to kind of give us an

2152
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:08,479
umbrella integration um is is is

2153
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,719
probably a pretty vague term for most

2154
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:13,238
folks and so why don't we start with

2155
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:16,158
that like what is integration and what

2156
01:28:13,238 --> 01:28:19,039
are we looking to get out of it right

2157
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:20,719
okay so and we can look at this from a

2158
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:24,639
lot of different levels like depending

2159
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:28,079
on how we view who and what we are

2160
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:30,880
but on a most basic level you might say

2161
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:32,559
Hey you learn some stuff you learn some

2162
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,600
stuff about yourself you got some

2163
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:36,560
messages we we like to call them

2164
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:39,159
downloads these days

2165
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:41,840
sometimes and maybe marching

2166
01:28:39,158 --> 01:28:44,118
orders and so it was like okay maybe you

2167
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:46,480
should start doing this be nicer to

2168
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:48,079
people say you're sorry clean your room

2169
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:51,959
and maybe you should stop doing this

2170
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:53,600
smoking drinking too much whatever and

2171
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,399
and maybe on the long term you want to

2172
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,719
kind of move move towards this in your

2173
01:28:55,399 --> 01:29:00,399
life you want to become a chef you have

2174
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:04,319
to go to culinary school right and so

2175
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:07,118
figuring out how to get those done like

2176
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:09,319
what might what is it like to genuinely

2177
01:29:07,118 --> 01:29:11,519
be kinder to people what is it like to

2178
01:29:09,319 --> 01:29:13,679
be more humble and say you're sorry when

2179
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,719
you mess up even though sometimes it

2180
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:17,600
feels like you might die if you have to

2181
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:19,520
say you're sorry that it's the most

2182
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:23,000
vulnerable thing in the world what might

2183
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,880
it be like to quit drinking when that's

2184
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,359
what you know right and that's how you

2185
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:30,920
interact with people and then what does

2186
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:33,759
it take to actually get yourself to and

2187
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:36,239
through culinary school right all of

2188
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:38,480
these kinds of dreams and upgrades that

2189
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:40,439
are available and what is it going to

2190
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:41,718
take to kind of make this happen right

2191
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:46,198
so that's part of

2192
01:29:41,719 --> 01:29:48,439
integration um and what often happens is

2193
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:49,839
people start off with good intentions

2194
01:29:48,439 --> 01:29:51,359
and then it drops off life gets in the

2195
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,679
way they don't have any accountability

2196
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,319
they don't have anything anybody um to

2197
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,920
support them right we just kind of

2198
01:29:55,319 --> 01:29:59,279
forget our lessons yeah we can forget

2199
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,039
our lessons and then you know what

2200
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:03,439
happens when we forget our

2201
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:06,679
lessons is our Vibe

2202
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:08,439
drops right so also this is my favorite

2203
01:30:06,679 --> 01:30:12,279
I really like integration of

2204
01:30:08,439 --> 01:30:15,238
transcendence and mystical experience so

2205
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:16,399
this is what keeps me coming back is I

2206
01:30:15,238 --> 01:30:20,879
have these

2207
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:26,960
experiences of bliss Oneness connection

2208
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:29,039
God love all of that stuff right and I

2209
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:31,118
like that and I like that feeling and I

2210
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:33,719
can feel speaking about shapes like

2211
01:30:31,118 --> 01:30:36,079
being in that kind of ecstatic con

2212
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:39,560
connected State shapes us in a certain

2213
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:42,238
way right we get shaped by Bliss and joy

2214
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:44,360
and the spiritual experience which is

2215
01:30:42,238 --> 01:30:45,959
awesome and then perhaps we vibrate in a

2216
01:30:44,359 --> 01:30:48,319
certain way or we show up for the world

2217
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:49,520
in a certain way um depending on whether

2218
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:51,840
or not you know whatever you think of

2219
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,760
Vibes but we show up different and we

2220
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,360
feel amazing and we want to hold on to

2221
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,119
that

2222
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:59,880
but then the thing is is that that

2223
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:02,238
starts to downgrade too and it starts to

2224
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:04,480
downgrade because we stop practicing

2225
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:06,718
humility we stop practicing kindness we

2226
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:09,158
stop practicing truth and we drink too

2227
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:10,399
much and we eat the wrong stuff right so

2228
01:31:09,158 --> 01:31:13,479
it's like the

2229
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:16,479
lessons kind of correlate the doing and

2230
01:31:13,479 --> 01:31:18,118
the being we start to see a connection

2231
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:20,638
if I want to be the person that I want

2232
01:31:18,118 --> 01:31:22,238
to be it means I have to do the things

2233
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,440
that I know I'm supposed to do yeah

2234
01:31:22,238 --> 01:31:26,559
ain't ain't that the rub

2235
01:31:24,439 --> 01:31:28,118
yeah and you know if you want to stay

2236
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,560
connected to one one of the things I I

2237
01:31:28,118 --> 01:31:31,158
say to people like if you want to Stay

2238
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,000
Connected To Source you have to serve

2239
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:35,599
the

2240
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:39,118
source right and so there's that um

2241
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:43,679
integration might also mean that there

2242
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:46,759
are kind of parts of you that you

2243
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:48,520
haven't been embodying or living right

2244
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:51,199
maybe kind humility Parts but like

2245
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:52,800
sometimes we discover that there are

2246
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:54,479
that we maybe are a more creative person

2247
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,000
that we gave ourselves credit for for

2248
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:59,319
and so there's like again this kind of

2249
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,319
integration of uh being our our full

2250
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:03,960
potential like letting our full

2251
01:32:01,319 --> 01:32:05,920
potential really have a chance instead

2252
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:08,439
of just squashing it down and saying it

2253
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:11,359
doesn't matter and and putting it away

2254
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:14,279
there might also be

2255
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:16,158
um like integrate like healing might

2256
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:18,719
have to happen right we might need to

2257
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:20,479
heal from like some really difficult

2258
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:22,359
stuff we might have uh repressed

2259
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:24,039
memories come up of abuse or something

2260
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:26,920
like that and we have to kind of

2261
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:31,279
integrate our own personal history in a

2262
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:34,039
new way so that we can uh be a whole

2263
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:36,238
healed healthy person so we can look at

2264
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:37,600
it from like a lot of different angles

2265
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:39,158
and depending on who you are and what

2266
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,480
you're going through at any particular

2267
01:32:39,158 --> 01:32:42,719
time in your Soul's Journey it might

2268
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:47,519
mean different

2269
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:49,198
things so um let's say that uh you know

2270
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,119
somebody just had this psychedelic

2271
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:53,519
experience and they want to do

2272
01:32:51,118 --> 01:32:55,639
integration because they want to really

2273
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,440
embra embrace the lessons that they

2274
01:32:55,639 --> 01:33:01,039
learned and you know if this person

2275
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:03,439
already has a therapist you know chances

2276
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:04,960
are very likely that they will do this

2277
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:07,439
integration with the therapist they

2278
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,880
already have but lots of people who are

2279
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,960
doing psychedelics don't actually have a

2280
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:14,199
relationship pre-existing with the

2281
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:16,319
therapist what kind of advice do you

2282
01:33:14,198 --> 01:33:19,158
have for those

2283
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:23,079
people um well get one if you can afford

2284
01:33:19,158 --> 01:33:24,559
one mhm um and it's of course cool if

2285
01:33:23,079 --> 01:33:27,118
you find you know there's an increasing

2286
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:29,520
amount of therapists who are willing to

2287
01:33:27,118 --> 01:33:32,880
talk about psychedelics with you so

2288
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:35,719
that's cool um you

2289
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,880
can find an integration Circle you can

2290
01:33:35,719 --> 01:33:39,319
find an integration coach or an

2291
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:44,000
integration Circle um an integration

2292
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:47,399
circle is kind of halfway between like a

2293
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,760
meditation group and a support group MH

2294
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:51,198
right so it's like it it it kind of

2295
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:54,719
might look like a support group on the

2296
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:56,439
outside but um it doesn't necessarily

2297
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,520
mean anybody's broken or wounded or

2298
01:33:56,439 --> 01:34:00,960
anything you know I mean we all are but

2299
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:02,920
it's not it's not like a Survivor type

2300
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,600
support group you necessarily it's it's

2301
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,600
a slightly different vibe you know

2302
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,800
people are just kind of like really

2303
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:11,280
growing right so it's it's got that kind

2304
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,760
of thing to it um as well as healing in

2305
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:16,000
some cases and that is a place where you

2306
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,360
can talk about you know what's important

2307
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,840
to you and what you got out of your

2308
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:21,880
experience and how you want to keep it

2309
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:24,119
going with a group of people who are you

2310
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:26,719
know semi-regular

2311
01:34:24,118 --> 01:34:28,920
and you kind of form a relationship with

2312
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:32,079
folks and sometimes you know we have

2313
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:33,960
three a week um you know on our on our

2314
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:35,238
website they're all on zoom and then

2315
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,920
depending where you live in the world

2316
01:34:35,238 --> 01:34:39,718
there might be one in

2317
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:42,639
person um you know it just so happens

2318
01:34:39,719 --> 01:34:44,279
that I have a uh an online a little mean

2319
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,279
online course on how to make your own

2320
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:47,079
you can you can start your own

2321
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:51,158
integration Circle then it's not rocket

2322
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:54,238
science um so you know some Community

2323
01:34:51,158 --> 01:34:56,599
Support is a big deal

2324
01:34:54,238 --> 01:35:00,000
um some of it you have to do on your own

2325
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:03,239
of course like nobody can nobody cannot

2326
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,279
drink for you MH right right you know

2327
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:07,039
nobody can journal for nobody can

2328
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:10,329
journal and meditate for you you have to

2329
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:11,639
do that on your own so

2330
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:14,000
[Music]

2331
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:15,800
um yeah I I don't know if that answers

2332
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,359
your question sure it does and and and

2333
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:21,400
the next question would be um I know

2334
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:24,679
that there are some independently minded

2335
01:35:21,399 --> 01:35:27,638
people who are listening and and um you

2336
01:35:24,679 --> 01:35:30,679
know people who have got you know always

2337
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:33,159
seeking autonomy like I am and and we're

2338
01:35:30,679 --> 01:35:37,600
thinking oh well I can just do that on

2339
01:35:33,158 --> 01:35:40,679
my own and um you know I just I have

2340
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:45,800
this belief without any real evidence

2341
01:35:40,679 --> 01:35:48,118
that that doing integration with others

2342
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:50,159
um who are not U who have got a

2343
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:52,479
different perspective and are are a

2344
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:54,359
little more objective and especially if

2345
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:56,319
they've got therapy training

2346
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:57,439
that it just seems to be more effective

2347
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,519
to do

2348
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:02,879
integration um along with someone else

2349
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:04,719
if if if only to have someone to bounce

2350
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,560
stuff off of what are your thoughts

2351
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:11,000
about that yeah you can't we can't see

2352
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:13,639
ourselves like you can't see your own

2353
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,520
eye you know what I mean like you just

2354
01:36:13,639 --> 01:36:19,239
we just can't and because because I'm in

2355
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:22,520
the Skinner box right so so me looking

2356
01:36:19,238 --> 01:36:25,000
me observing myself is is incredibly

2357
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:26,679
subjective so so we need it it's help

2358
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,520
for us to have somebody who's looking at

2359
01:36:26,679 --> 01:36:31,840
us on the outside is that the

2360
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:33,920
idea um yeah yeah you you you're

2361
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:36,279
strategies of evasion are highly

2362
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:38,000
sophisticated yes they are I'll say that

2363
01:36:36,279 --> 01:36:40,158
once say that for those of you in the

2364
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,118
back your strategies of evasion are

2365
01:36:40,158 --> 01:36:43,960
highly

2366
01:36:41,118 --> 01:36:46,599
sophisticated right and so there there

2367
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:49,439
you know you one would I I don't want to

2368
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:50,840
say need but I will you know we need to

2369
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:53,638
have a little bit of willingness and a

2370
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:56,440
little bit of humility sometimes and to

2371
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:57,920
recognize that we are relational beings

2372
01:36:56,439 --> 01:37:00,319
and you've just been talking this whole

2373
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:01,760
time about oh I I did the psychedelics

2374
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:04,359
with my friend and it friends and it's

2375
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:07,039
good to have a group it's good to have a

2376
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:09,118
group right like you could meet you know

2377
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:12,039
what would it be like if you and your

2378
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:15,399
your party people said okay like we're

2379
01:37:12,039 --> 01:37:18,880
going to meet once a week at the same

2380
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:20,399
time right for an intentional meeting

2381
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,840
much like that intention that you all

2382
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:25,319
brought to fixing your friend's foot

2383
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:27,639
right we're going to meet for 4 weeks

2384
01:37:25,319 --> 01:37:29,719
before our journey for an hour and a

2385
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:30,840
half uh we're going to have a a

2386
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:32,439
conference call or we're going to meet

2387
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:35,279
at the coffee shop or whatever we're

2388
01:37:32,439 --> 01:37:37,559
going to get on Zoom and we're going to

2389
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:39,000
wrap about what we want and we're going

2390
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,960
to talk about we're going to listen to

2391
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,359
the shaping fire podcast and we're going

2392
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,079
to make our own checklist we're going to

2393
01:37:42,359 --> 01:37:45,479
set it up and we're going to talk about

2394
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:46,639
our hopes and our dreams and our desires

2395
01:37:45,479 --> 01:37:49,238
we're going to be vulnerable with each

2396
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:51,760
other right and then after the trip

2397
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:53,158
we're going to meet for four to 6 weeks

2398
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,639
for an hour and a half and we're going

2399
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:56,439
to talk talk about how our experience is

2400
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:58,440
unfolding and we're going to hold each

2401
01:37:56,439 --> 01:38:00,439
other accountable and we're going to

2402
01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:02,960
focus on what's important we're going to

2403
01:38:00,439 --> 01:38:05,198
reflect back what we saw from each other

2404
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,880
in our Journeys and we're going to see

2405
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:08,638
what we learned about ourselves and each

2406
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,880
other and we're going to be there if

2407
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:15,279
somebody is confused about something and

2408
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:18,359
offer them um support and and good and

2409
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:20,079
good um Fellowship without again laying

2410
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:22,359
our trips on each other or offering each

2411
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:24,319
other a lot of advice but just kind of

2412
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:26,799
recognizing that we're growing together

2413
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:29,479
like how would that change the journey

2414
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,079
if it was it would wildly improve it

2415
01:38:29,479 --> 01:38:32,519
hearing you describe it I'm like man

2416
01:38:31,079 --> 01:38:35,000
I've never done that I want to sign up

2417
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:37,960
for that like like that level of

2418
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,960
integration would really expand the

2419
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:41,118
healing that any particular psychedelic

2420
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:43,719
experience

2421
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:46,960
has right and right and I say it and

2422
01:38:43,719 --> 01:38:49,800
it's almost like duh right yeah yeah it

2423
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:51,840
is but but honestly I you know I don't

2424
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:54,440
know about how psychedelics are done in

2425
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,119
the rest of the world but you know i'

2426
01:38:54,439 --> 01:38:58,319
I've been involved with the Psychedelic

2427
01:38:56,118 --> 01:39:02,439
world for you know 35 years and

2428
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:05,599
integration is not historically a part

2429
01:39:02,439 --> 01:39:08,879
of the you know every person's

2430
01:39:05,599 --> 01:39:10,400
psychedelic experience yeah and my God

2431
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:13,159
it should

2432
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:16,638
be yeah yeah yeah for sure and it's

2433
01:39:13,158 --> 01:39:19,598
almost like keep in mind that you know

2434
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:22,199
in Peru like the iasa people of Peru

2435
01:39:19,599 --> 01:39:24,840
shapo tribes and such don't really do

2436
01:39:22,198 --> 01:39:26,359
integration circles they live very

2437
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,279
different

2438
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:30,799
lives you know what I mean like they

2439
01:39:28,279 --> 01:39:33,719
live like a slower paced life right

2440
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:36,119
their society in a lot of ways was built

2441
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:37,960
off of people doing iasa like if you

2442
01:39:36,118 --> 01:39:40,598
were a tri if you if you and your

2443
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:44,319
friends had the wherewithal to start a

2444
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:45,639
society based on your Journeys together

2445
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:47,198
like what would that Society look like

2446
01:39:45,639 --> 01:39:51,880
and then that's what you have right in

2447
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:54,039
Peru in many ways um so so it's built

2448
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,719
into some cultures it's not built into

2449
01:39:54,039 --> 01:39:58,198
our culture and and you know

2450
01:39:55,719 --> 01:39:59,880
vulnerability and Community is not

2451
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:02,598
necessarily built into our cultures at

2452
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:04,920
least not like a vulnerable kind of

2453
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:08,039
community thing right like it's it's

2454
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:12,239
more like it's more external you know

2455
01:40:08,039 --> 01:40:14,118
it's exoteric and in a lot of ways um

2456
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:17,158
you know still built around like what

2457
01:40:14,118 --> 01:40:20,279
what the individual can get out of it on

2458
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:24,079
a real mechanical level if if somebody

2459
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:27,599
wants to do integration with a a

2460
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:29,319
professional um what would you recommend

2461
01:40:27,599 --> 01:40:31,159
they look for like what are the

2462
01:40:29,319 --> 01:40:34,039
attributes and what are the things that

2463
01:40:31,158 --> 01:40:36,000
they should think of when choosing who

2464
01:40:34,039 --> 01:40:38,319
to work with I mean you've you've taught

2465
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,679
so many so many facilitators and

2466
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:44,118
integration specialist you probably have

2467
01:40:40,679 --> 01:40:46,800
got you know a good a good list of uh

2468
01:40:44,118 --> 01:40:48,920
best practices for choosing one right

2469
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:52,199
well I mean you should start with me

2470
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:54,480
right reach out to me um you know you

2471
01:40:52,198 --> 01:40:57,879
would probably want somebody who was

2472
01:40:54,479 --> 01:41:00,839
very familiar with the territory so you

2473
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:03,599
know I don't have an advanced

2474
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:05,360
degree you know I I I don't I don't like

2475
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:08,239
I don't like traditional schooling you

2476
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:11,479
know I've uh taught and trained many

2477
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:13,479
people with Advanced degrees um but you

2478
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:15,039
know I as soon as I got out of college I

2479
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:17,519
just I found a yoga mat and I hung out

2480
01:41:15,039 --> 01:41:18,639
in yoga studios and meditation halls and

2481
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,840
stuff like that and that's kind of where

2482
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:22,880
I did a lot of my

2483
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,800
training um so you have to decide like

2484
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:27,239
is

2485
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:28,719
the degree important like to what extent

2486
01:41:27,238 --> 01:41:30,479
is the degree important and to what

2487
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:32,279
extent is the experience important and

2488
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:33,519
if you can get both that's great yeah

2489
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:35,439
you know especially if there's rightness

2490
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:38,440
of fit so you want to be working with

2491
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:41,559
somebody who you feel seen and not

2492
01:41:38,439 --> 01:41:45,719
judged and held by right then and

2493
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:47,560
they're clever right so um so you want

2494
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:49,760
to be that's what you're kind of looking

2495
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:51,840
for you know if somebody is kind of just

2496
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:54,400
out of school and they've you know

2497
01:41:51,840 --> 01:42:00,119
they've done a little bit of aamine

2498
01:41:54,399 --> 01:42:01,920
training maybe maybe not mhm you know um

2499
01:42:00,118 --> 01:42:05,000
but you know you can vet people you can

2500
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:07,158
ask people stuff um and you know in the

2501
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,359
realm of social media you know there's

2502
01:42:07,158 --> 01:42:12,079
there's people out there sort of like

2503
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:14,679
you know blabbing about how smart they

2504
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:17,439
are all the time and maybe you find one

2505
01:42:14,679 --> 01:42:19,639
that resonates with you I think that's

2506
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:21,919
the very important part is is to find

2507
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:24,960
somebody who's got a communication style

2508
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:27,118
that that I feel blends with my own

2509
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:31,239
because we're going to be talking about

2510
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:33,279
but intimate and subtle and um you know

2511
01:42:31,238 --> 01:42:34,879
I think subtle is the right word things

2512
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:36,559
and I I want somebody where we're

2513
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,599
already kind of speaking the same

2514
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,360
language so that we can get to the core

2515
01:42:38,599 --> 01:42:41,960
of the matters uh

2516
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:44,839
swiftly

2517
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:47,198
effectively yeah right so somebody is

2518
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:49,159
one of the best compliments I've gotten

2519
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:51,719
was

2520
01:42:49,158 --> 01:42:53,638
disarming right which almost sounds kind

2521
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:55,039
of you know I I almost had would be like

2522
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:56,760
wait what do you mean and they were like

2523
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:58,880
well you just you make me want to like

2524
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:01,320
put down my weapons my defense my

2525
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:03,279
defensive structures you know I can I

2526
01:43:01,319 --> 01:43:05,840
can drop my defenses and and be myself

2527
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:08,359
and I was like oh okay that's nice you

2528
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:09,599
know you want to feel like you can take

2529
01:43:08,359 --> 01:43:11,960
your armor

2530
01:43:09,599 --> 01:43:13,920
off so now that we've been talking with

2531
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:15,399
integration uh about integration a

2532
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,960
little bit because I I've been learning

2533
01:43:15,399 --> 01:43:20,039
as you've been talking um I think that I

2534
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:21,359
would probably summarize it like if I

2535
01:43:20,039 --> 01:43:22,679
were if I were to be talking with

2536
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:23,839
somebody else later on today about

2537
01:43:22,679 --> 01:43:26,960
integration

2538
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:29,039
I think I would describe it as um so we

2539
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,639
learn lessons when we're on

2540
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:33,359
psychedelics and we you know those of us

2541
01:43:31,639 --> 01:43:35,719
who have done psychedelics we've all had

2542
01:43:33,359 --> 01:43:38,079
the experience of of forgetting our

2543
01:43:35,719 --> 01:43:42,760
lessons and leaving them behind in the

2544
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:46,599
Psychedelic experience and so what um an

2545
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:49,440
integration coach or or similar will do

2546
01:43:46,599 --> 01:43:52,800
is help you bring those lessons from the

2547
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:56,479
Psychedelic psychedelic experience and

2548
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:59,719
help to integrate them into your non

2549
01:43:56,479 --> 01:44:01,559
psychedelic everyday life so that the

2550
01:43:59,719 --> 01:44:03,880
good things that you have discovered

2551
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:05,920
during the Psychedelic experience you

2552
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:07,760
actually get to use those to improve

2553
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:09,599
your life instead of just having a

2554
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,440
psychedelic experience and having these

2555
01:44:09,599 --> 01:44:13,719
thoughts and then H and then having them

2556
01:44:11,439 --> 01:44:15,919
slip away is that a is that a fair

2557
01:44:13,719 --> 01:44:18,960
assessment yeah yeah that's a that's a

2558
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:22,239
great place to be with all that right on

2559
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:25,719
well thank you for explaining that so um

2560
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:27,479
so let's w up there Daniel so um I'm

2561
01:44:25,719 --> 01:44:29,198
going to put you on the spot a little

2562
01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:31,559
bit but in a in a way that you're

2563
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:35,439
probably very used to yeah lightning

2564
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:38,360
round um so so what would be your what

2565
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:41,479
would be your last advice for somebody

2566
01:44:38,359 --> 01:44:44,000
who has never done psychedelics before

2567
01:44:41,479 --> 01:44:45,919
they have found a good source for the

2568
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:50,359
Psychedelic of choice that they want to

2569
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:53,520
use and they're just trying to like rev

2570
01:44:50,359 --> 01:44:55,039
up The Moxy or the gumption they know

2571
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,040
they want to do it they they have it

2572
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:59,760
they're they're good to go but it sounds

2573
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:02,198
like it sounds like you know taking the

2574
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,039
step off of a cliff or something to them

2575
01:45:02,198 --> 01:45:06,079
and and and and they don't know what

2576
01:45:04,039 --> 01:45:08,158
it's going to be like and and so they've

2577
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:09,679
got a little hesitation maybe they've

2578
01:45:08,158 --> 01:45:11,479
even maybe they've even had the

2579
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:13,079
Psychedelic in their pocket for months

2580
01:45:11,479 --> 01:45:16,158
and they haven't like taken the next

2581
01:45:13,079 --> 01:45:20,519
step um what what would be your advice

2582
01:45:16,158 --> 01:45:24,719
for them to to to help them in this next

2583
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:27,520
step oh I don't I don't know um I don't

2584
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:28,840
I don't love this question um well if

2585
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:32,280
you don't love the question maybe speak

2586
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:36,360
to that and we'll learn from that well

2587
01:45:32,279 --> 01:45:38,479
it's you know it's it's not for me to to

2588
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:41,319
you you you you you can lead a horse to

2589
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:44,559
water right like it's not for me to push

2590
01:45:41,319 --> 01:45:45,759
somebody off um you know to push

2591
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:49,880
somebody into the

2592
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:52,639
pool right I mean I would just be really

2593
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:54,400
curious if if I was coaching them right

2594
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:56,000
so it's I if I was coaching them it's

2595
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:59,079
it's not a performance coaching it's not

2596
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,560
like um Glen Gary Glenn Ross you know

2597
01:45:59,079 --> 01:46:03,319
there not coffees for closers right this

2598
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:06,320
is this is what we call development

2599
01:46:03,319 --> 01:46:07,799
coaching and so I just want to hear

2600
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:11,238
about your

2601
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:14,679
anxiety right I just want to know what's

2602
01:46:11,238 --> 01:46:17,598
coming up for you and what is holding

2603
01:46:14,679 --> 01:46:20,639
you back because it's entirely possible

2604
01:46:17,599 --> 01:46:23,079
it's highly probable that that

2605
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:24,719
trepidation that you're feeling has has

2606
01:46:23,079 --> 01:46:27,920
served you really well throughout your

2607
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:29,039
life M right like that trepidation there

2608
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,560
may have been times when that

2609
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:31,479
trepidation was the difference between

2610
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:34,360
life and

2611
01:46:31,479 --> 01:46:37,479
death right and so I want to honor like

2612
01:46:34,359 --> 01:46:39,559
I deeply honor people's

2613
01:46:37,479 --> 01:46:41,079
hesitancy right it's it's a it's a

2614
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:44,560
display as far as I'm concerned it's a

2615
01:46:41,079 --> 01:46:48,599
display of wisdom and discernment and so

2616
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:51,400
I you know I I bow to your trepidation

2617
01:46:48,599 --> 01:46:53,679
and I want you to know that it is safe

2618
01:46:51,399 --> 01:46:54,559
and acceptable for you to be hesitant

2619
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:57,920
and

2620
01:46:54,560 --> 01:47:01,639
anxious right and like let's learn more

2621
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:05,440
about that um how has it served you in

2622
01:47:01,639 --> 01:47:09,319
the past right what is its aim how is it

2623
01:47:05,439 --> 01:47:11,839
held in the body um what is it make

2624
01:47:09,319 --> 01:47:14,359
possible for you does it limit you from

2625
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:17,279
things sometimes right it's like what

2626
01:47:14,359 --> 01:47:19,598
can we learn about our this is their

2627
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:21,359
shape right coming back to it the your

2628
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:24,639
person is showing up and that's their

2629
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:25,920
shape right they're bracing perhaps I'm

2630
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,920
just picturing in my head you know as I

2631
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,920
picture this person who's hesitant I'm

2632
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:32,199
picturing like a musculature like a

2633
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,800
tension almost as if they're bracing for

2634
01:47:32,198 --> 01:47:36,839
impact right I'm picturing like like oh

2635
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:38,719
like I'm hand like if somebody would be

2636
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:41,000
handing them the mushroom and they're

2637
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:43,279
like ah right and their hands go out

2638
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,238
like they're pushing away like oh like I

2639
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:46,880
like it's I fear I'm not safe it's

2640
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:49,158
dangerous right and so there's that

2641
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:52,118
tension there and that's their shape and

2642
01:47:49,158 --> 01:47:53,479
they can't do anything else they can't

2643
01:47:52,118 --> 01:47:56,079
not do that

2644
01:47:53,479 --> 01:47:58,879
that's the thing that has been keeping

2645
01:47:56,079 --> 01:48:00,960
them in as good a shape as they are

2646
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:04,440
right and so let's explore it let's

2647
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:06,639
learn about it let's see if there are

2648
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:08,638
other ways to practice being in a

2649
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:10,400
different shape that is more in line

2650
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:12,520
with your higher intentions and value

2651
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:15,439
and

2652
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:17,440
purpose well I really like how you took

2653
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:19,960
the question that you weren't a big fan

2654
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:23,000
