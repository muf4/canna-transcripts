00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,910
for decades there have been two families

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,370
in cannabis the outdoor growers who use

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,829
a sunshine and indoor growers who used

5
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:19,589
lights they each developed their own

6
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:21,899
approaches both dabbled in synthetic

7
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,390
nutrients but indoor growers really

8
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,149
approached synthetic and process

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,580
nutrients as an art form outdoor folks

10
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:32,549
generally were using less process inputs

11
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,649
but certainly not always and both groups

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,769
tended to use chemical pesticides when

13
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,370
needed over the last 20 years as people

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,660
became more aware of eating organic food

15
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:45,538
health-conscious cannabis farmers both

16
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:47,699
indoors and outdoors began reducing

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,270
their synthetic inputs and using more

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,039
raw natural materials very generally

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,960
though it was the outdoor folks who were

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,670
leading in that direction and indoor

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,829
growers were still focused on bottled

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,739
nutrients especially hydroponic folks

23
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,558
all of that has been turned upside down

24
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,359
as more cultivators in every part of the

25
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,780
industry began to use more natural

26
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,760
inputs and then with state taxation of

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,368
cannabis came regulations that nearly

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,049
demanded the exclusion of many of the

29
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:19,170
traditional chemicals growers would use

30
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,659
as a person who's dedicated to living

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,180
soil you can imagine my curiosity and

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,180
glee when I came across images on

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,610
Instagram of grow operations in just

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,090
about every legal state beginning to

35
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:35,188
bring living soil techniques indoors the

36
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,189
lushness of the poly culture and

37
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:40,949
companion planning but done indoors in

38
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,629
raised beds or on tables I started

39
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,549
talking to other folks like me about

40
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:46,289
these amazing photos I was seeing and

41
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,470
they were all jazzed about these new

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,290
possibilities to a bright future of

43
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,989
climate controlled indoor growing but

44
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,170
with real living soil and worms instead

45
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:00,000
of mechanized hydroponics if you want to

46
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,500
learn about cannabis health business and

47

education and has himself evolved from

79
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:08,639
using synthetics to using organic

80
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:10,798
bottled nutrients and is now dedicated

81
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,509
to living soil no-till and raw

82
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,590
amendments today we're going to talk

83
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,530
about all those things

84
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,969
welcome to the show Joshua hey thanks

85
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,609
for having me oh I'm so glad to have you

86
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:23,009
on so let's start by giving a little

87
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:24,180
context of folks about where you come

88
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:26,729
from kind of I don't know

89
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,819
philosophically so how did you find your

90
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:32,129
way to indoor polyculture like were you

91
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:35,039
an indoor guy who wanted to be more

92
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,568
natural or were you an outdoor guy who

93
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,530
then you brought your outdoor skills

94
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:43,469
indoors for work yeah I'm actually it

95
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,199
always been an indoor cultivator and I

96
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,750
just I'd never had the space to do it

97
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,638
outdoors and always just I was really

98
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,439
intrigued with the idea of being having

99
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,739
a controlled environment and being able

100
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:59,849
to control all those different various

101
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,530
variables and and eventually just kind

102
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,299
of gravitated towards wanting to do

103
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,120
things in a more natural fashion and

104
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,799
that's how I ended up where I'm at it's

105
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,109
really interesting because you know for

106
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,209
so long you know a lot of the indoor

107
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:14,670
folks are like listen you just can't use

108
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,009
these outdoor techniques indoors they

109
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:18,719
just don't make the transition and for a

110
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:20,759
long time people kind of you know some

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,250
people believe that and now suddenly in

112
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,918
the last few years people like you are

113
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,019
actually doing it so when you first

114
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,459
started you know

115
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,258
implementing this stuff and you know

116
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:32,418
telling your buddies about it did you

117
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:34,699
get some disbelief and pushback and you

118
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:36,948
had to push you know you know prove them

119
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:40,098
wrong or were people like hell yeah man

120
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:44,509
go that direction uh there was a fair

121
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:47,598
amount of healthy skepticism and and as

122
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:50,120
I just kept progressing and kept pushing

123
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:52,810
forward people were seeing the results I

124
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,240
was getting and they're they're kind of

125
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,889
speak for themselves yeah they sure do I

126
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,930
mean that's that's what started all of

127
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,519
this with me reaching out to you is I

128
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,400
just started following you on Instagram

129
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,978
and the the the images of your

130
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,769
polyculture tables at fresh water which

131
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:11,870
is like astonishing it was you know just

132
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:13,908
like looking them and making the picture

133
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,709
big you know and so that you can look

134
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:17,990
really closely and going oh my god he's

135
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:20,448
actually doing this so that was all

136
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,389
really exciting so so you know aside

137
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:25,879
from the cannabis team of ours that

138
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,949
you're choosing how did you go about

139
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,509
choosing your companion plants because

140
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,759
you've got a lot of options to choose

141
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,908
from how did you think through that that

142
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,710
that challenge that's a good question I

143
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:38,149
mean there's a lot of really good

144
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:39,888
information and there's a lot of great

145
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:42,049
companies like build a soil that put

146
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:45,139
together cover crop blends that are kind

147
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,300
of pre-made for living soils that have

148
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:51,889
lots of clover and you know

149
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,319
nitrogen-fixing companion plants with

150
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,750
that avail that kind of information

151
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,669
available readily available it was

152
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,728
really easy to kind of just dive in and

153
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:03,918
start learning what was happening below

154
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:06,589
the surface you know not with just the

155
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,810
cannabis roots but with the roots of the

156
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:10,638
other plants and and even like the

157
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:14,329
foliage with the dynamic accumulators

158
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,460
like comfrey and whatnot that I just

159
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:18,978
really just douve in and started looking

160
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,870
into what all those what all the

161
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:24,649
benefits are and everything that I kept

162
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,000
coming up with was diversity is key you

163
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:29,929
know you really you really want to

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,899
diverse population of companion plants

165
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,968
too because they all do something

166
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:39,218
different they all have their their

167
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:40,740
little part to play in this symphony and

168
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:43,110
it just seemed

169
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,310
to me that the more parts and the more

170
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,889
things are allowed to play their part

171
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,348
the sweeter the music oh right on that's

172
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,538
nicely put so so how many notes do you

173
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:53,370
use you know this may be this may be a

174
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,159
question that you don't actually know

175
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:59,340
but do you know how many other species

176
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,370
of companion plants you've got outside

177
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,138
of the cannabis oh my goodness it's it's

178
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,780
pretty considerable I started with the

179
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:10,228
twelve seat cover cropland from bill to

180
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,689
soil and then from which says you know

181
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:15,240
like 60% clovers different clovers and

182
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:18,589
and vetch and whatnot and then I started

183
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,978
adding other things like daikon radish

184
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:24,839
beets broccoli we have and and I've

185
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:27,180
recently learned that broccoli might

186
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:31,049
actually not be good because of a

187
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,150
potential fungal inhibiting component of

188
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,180
its of it so I have to some research to

189
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:39,388
do on that but so we're always learning

190
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,269
you know we're all I'm forever educating

191
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,500
myself and if I learned that something's

192
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:45,060
not good for the bed like if I learned

193
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,139
that broccoli is not good I'm taking it

194
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,759
out for sure but I've got so many so

195
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,819
many things in there I'm really just not

196
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,979
afraid to throw anything in there so so

197
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:59,779
so alright so the broccoli may not make

198
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:02,189
it or may not stay but have you already

199
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:05,129
experimented with any other plants that

200
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:08,189
you decided don't work for you to be

201
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:11,668
honest with you know you know everything

202
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:14,009
tends to the things that some things

203
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:16,889
just don't come back from the flowering

204
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:20,218
period because the canopy gets so dense

205
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,870
there's a relatively large die-off that

206
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:24,300
happens underneath so during the

207
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,399
vegetative stage when there's lots of

208
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,560
light penetrating the cover crop

209
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,620
flourishes and then your companion

210
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,200
plants flourish and then the canopy kind

211
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,639
of overtakes things and you get a lot

212
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,370
less light down there to the soil

213
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,468
surface and then there's this die-off

214
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,328
and sometimes things just don't come

215
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:45,360
back like I've had comfrey die-off and

216
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:47,159
not come back and I don't really foster

217
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,629
or worry about it I just figure if it

218
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,669
the conditions weren't right for that

219
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,679
particular one to come back then I'm not

220
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:54,370
really worried then that's really

221
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,479
interesting I've never really considered

222
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:01,600
how the the dense canopy of a cannabis

223
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,460
plant would block out the light from the

224
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,320
unders and suddenly it's like you know

225
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,839
like when you visit the the giant

226
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,500
redwoods right it's mostly just ferns

227
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,110
and and you know Duff on the ground at

228
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,879
that point and so a lot of the plants

229
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,050
that when the plants start when the

230
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,278
cannabis plants are young they're

231
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:20,879
getting full light suddenly they're

232
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:25,450
gonna get choked out its have you ever

233
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:29,379
like replanted or added low light plants

234
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,790
like when you start bloom um no that

235
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:32,799
that's a that's an interesting

236
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:36,250
consideration I really have I haven't

237
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,979
though I do reseed occasionally like if

238
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,080
we get a significant die-off and for one

239
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,629
reason or another sometimes the the

240
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,259
large leaves likes a specialty of

241
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,600
comfrey

242
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:49,569
they'll die off and they'll completely

243
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,670
choke out any light from the soil

244
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,528
surface so you end up once the comfrey

245
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:57,849
leaves have been kind of consumed by the

246
00:09:53,528 --> 00:10:00,939
soil biology you're left with a bare

247
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:04,389
spot and so occasionally I'll have to

248
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,770
reseed those bare spots and but us

249
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:10,389
making specific light low light plant

250
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:13,269
considerations I just haven't done that

251
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:15,909
I've really kind of appreciate the

252
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:18,490
nutrient cycling faction factor that

253
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:21,819
happens when the cover crop flourishes

254
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,549
it's got all this nutrient capacity in

255
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,560
its leaves and then the flowering period

256
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:29,379
starts and then so it dies off and

257
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:32,169
creates like a multi layer over the soil

258
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,419
so it's just building to the human heir

259
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:37,809
it's contributing to a nutrient cycling

260
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:39,639
and more importantly it just allows me

261
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:43,079
to spend less time in the garden and

262
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:46,330
just allow that kind of little micro

263
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:49,089
ecosystem to do its thing so I certainly

264
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:52,778
get the value of when you get the

265
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:55,390
die-off that that that nutrient nutrient

266
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:57,970
cycling is natural and good I've got

267
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:59,740
I've got to I guess really specific

268
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,070
questions about that so the first one

269
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,060
would be you know if if having the cover

270
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,270
crop with one of the benefits

271
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:10,909
of it is that it creates this like mini

272
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:14,449
rainforest down near the bottom so in

273
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:18,319
holds in moisture and and in water vapor

274
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:21,320
down towards the the top of the soil so

275
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,350
that your microbes can live closer to

276
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,060
the top of the soil does it do you worry

277
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,340
at all that if you've got these patches

278
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:32,449
that you're losing that advantage or

279
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,360
over the over the size of an entire bed

280
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,940
it doesn't really matter that much I

281
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,310
think when you take the whole bed into

282
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,050
consideration its it's not as big of a

283
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:45,429
factor and that that's the benefit I

284
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:50,359
think of having a larger soil volume

285
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:52,699
I've often used the analogy of aquarium

286
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,279
keeping your fish tanks and that I used

287
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,680
to keep little nano reef tanks and 55

288
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,689
gallon tanks and and for obvious reasons

289
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,899
the smaller the tank the harder it is to

290
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:05,060
keep things in equilibrium you know and

291
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:08,269
the larger the volume of water in the

292
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:11,839
tank it's a lot easier to keep it pH

293
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:13,850
stable and and everything so it's really

294
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,080
similar in soil beds if you've got a

295
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:22,460
larger 4 by 8 you got 1.2 or 1.3 yards

296
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:26,810
in of soil in your bed little pockets of

297
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,340
KCA anaerobic bacterial activity or you

298
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:30,919
know little pockets of areas that are

299
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,530
running less than optimally aren't

300
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,479
aren't such a big deal right on imma

301
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,909
take a little sidebar here

302
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,490
you mentioned aquariums and and I too

303
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:43,610
have got a background in aquariums and

304
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,740
actually after my brain injury one of

305
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,830
the only things I could do was raise a

306
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,870
specialty aquarium shrimp and sell those

307
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,030
other aquarium people and you know not

308
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,279
only do like you know stoner folk just

309
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:57,860
like looking at fish right but other

310
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,769
than that I find that people who are

311
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,409
into aquariums and building that kind of

312
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:06,740
natural and yet artificial environment

313
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:09,829
also take quickly to growing cannabis

314
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,210
because they are similar similar ideas

315
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,850
where it's like okay I want to make this

316
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,970
as natural as possible but I want to do

317
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,430
it in this artificial environment and

318
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,889
encapsulate nature you know in

319
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:23,620
side my home it was that kind of an

320
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,629
experience for you to absolutely I've

321
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,360
said I've had similar conversations with

322
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:30,490
people about this very topic that and at

323
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,870
the time at one point in time I was

324
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,870
really big into hydroponics and

325
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:38,919
recirculating deep water culture and and

326
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,539
I very often just kept feeling like it

327
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,949
was back in my aquarium days because

328
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:44,559
we're really in both of those instances

329
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,240
you're just water keepers you hit your

330
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,458
water tenders and it's here and it's

331
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,649
your job to keep the water you know the

332
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:52,958
water conditions perfect and so there's

333
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:56,528
a there's that obvious correlation there

334
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:59,829
and I think you kind of touched on it

335
00:13:56,528 --> 00:14:03,820
too that there's this kind of desire to

336
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:05,920
recreate something natural and and do it

337
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,200
you know in the most pristine way

338
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,449
possible and there's just there's kind

339
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,580
of this intrinsic reward there I like

340
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,770
your idea of aquarium being where water

341
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,950
keepers it reminds me I mean it reminds

342
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:20,230
me of the famous natural farming guy

343
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,900
Joel Saladin who always said listen I

344
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,089
don't I don't farm foods and chickens

345
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:27,579
and cattle he's like I'm a grass farmer

346
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:29,980
and so long as the grass is healthy you

347
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,320
know and pesticide and chemical free all

348
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,360
the animals that live upon it will do

349
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,700
well and I always thought that that you

350
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,100
know related really well to regenerative

351
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,350
cannabis growing as well where a lot of

352
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,300
what we're doing is is where soil

353
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:47,230
farmers we're microbe farmers and as

354
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:49,419
long as that soil is bountiful it will

355
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,459
offer the buffet of all the nutrients

356
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:53,439
that are cannabis plants need and then

357
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:56,259
they just do it on their own without

358
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,180
question it's it's a it's a wonderful

359
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:01,179
beautiful miracle that we've been you

360
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:04,799
know that we've been given and I'm a

361
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:07,299
really proud and impressed to see the

362
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,870
speed at which people are starting to

363
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:12,609
kind of reclaim this old you know this

364
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,980
old ways you know there's like this

365
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,789
revival of the old ways people are sick

366
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,250
of you know being lied to and being

367
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:24,129
poisoned and and and you realize that

368
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,899
there's just a simpler way and if you

369
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,559
just take care of the soil it takes care

370
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:28,509
of you

371
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,839
so circling back to when we were talking

372
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:35,019
about some of the spots of the

373
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,090
her crop dying out do you ever find that

374
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:39,490
that is helpful like a canary in a coal

375
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:42,160
mine where if something's going on with

376
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,950
your cover crop and maybe it's it's like

377
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,689
letting you know of a problem early that

378
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,540
you might experience with the cannabis

379
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:53,140
plants themselves yeah I mean I think if

380
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:58,209
you allowed yourself to kind of hyper

381
00:15:53,139 --> 00:16:00,220
analyze things you could definitely kind

382
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:03,040
of postulate what's going on I tend to

383
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,269
I'm really tend to be very very very

384
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:11,740
hands-off I'm very Fukuoka esque in I

385
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:13,990
like to just observe you know once once

386
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,419
the plants are in once things are going

387
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,430
it's really just our job to observe and

388
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:21,759
kind of do gentle steering and guiding

389
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:23,769
and and that's what really works for me

390
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,809
my days of being kind of the mad

391
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:29,980
scientist in the grow room and spending

392
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:31,839
hours in there you know fussing over pH

393
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:36,250
levels and all these other things those

394
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:38,830
are over those are long gone okay so to

395
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,169
get to your question is when I see bear

396
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,780
spots on there it's usually always been

397
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:46,740
because of a thick patch from the

398
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:50,289
die-off and if it and when I Reeve edge

399
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,250
if it doesn't get kind of repopulated by

400
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:56,079
there the reap the bloom of regrowth

401
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:59,980
then I'll you know the next cycle I'll

402
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:03,759
reseed it and I really don't worry or

403
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,799
concern myself too much because you know

404
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,869
it's a it's a really simple process and

405
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,720
if you long as you follow a few a few

406
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:14,229
simple rules it's really hard to go

407
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,019
wrong so this next question I'm gonna

408
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:19,930
I'm gonna suggest three categories of

409
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:22,720
poly cultural planting and and you are

410
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:24,820
clearly more advanced than I am on this

411
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,680
so I mean I'm gonna suggest this theory

412
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,929
and then I just want to hear your

413
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,140
thoughts on it even even if you

414
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,000
vehemently disagree so sure so I find

415
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,740
that I've so far in my learning about

416
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,589
poly culture planning they seem to fall

417
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,029
into three categories like first is

418
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:42,789
companion planting of plants that seem

419
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:44,920
to encourage cannabis plant grow

420
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:47,409
and then there seems to be inter

421
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,600
planting which is just simply green

422
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,940
filler to cover soil so that the

423
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,069
moisture is higher up in the soil

424
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,450
towards the surface and they Gen you

425
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:58,029
know they participate in a generally

426
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,640
healthy raizou sphere and then and then

427
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:02,649
there's I guess there's four categories

428
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,630
IPM planting of plants that it has

429
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,400
something to do with keeping pests away

430
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,980
and then some people add a fourth

431
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,450
category which is as food right so if

432
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,700
you're gonna go throw this this effort

433
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,170
you might as well get some you know you

434
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,720
know some cherry tomatoes to eat while

435
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,840
you're there or to the extreme example

436
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,370
you know Nick and Liz over at green

437
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,809
source Gardens where where they're

438
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:25,389
getting huge amounts of food out of

439
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:27,220
their outdoor Gardens so so with this in

440
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:30,190
mind you know how do you think about the

441
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:33,579
different categories of polyculture

442
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,380
plants when you are strategizing well

443
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:38,019
that's a really good question and I've

444
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,180
just got to give huge shout out to green

445
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:42,670
source Gardens those guys are just the

446
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,970
shining example of regenerative

447
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:47,860
homesteading and I just you know what

448
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,750
they have is something we should all be

449
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:51,549
striving for you know it's just they've

450
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,220
got a really beautiful thing and I can't

451
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:54,819
say enough good things about what what

452
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,430
they do

453
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:59,559
I second that good the two I got there

454
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,110
this summer floored me it's like this is

455
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,240
the gold standard for what we're all

456
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:06,069
trying to do yeah without question

457
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,349
without question they are this shining

458
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:10,809
example of the tip of the spear and they

459
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:13,629
they deserve all the alkaloids that that

460
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:16,720
come with that as far as the poly

461
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:19,920
culture you know at all the categories

462
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,110
that you mentioned I think we should win

463
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,960
when participating in this cultivation

464
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:28,299
style we should try to achieve all of

465
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:32,230
those things in the beds you know I

466
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:35,129
think at first my first concern was

467
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,839
maybe just kind of nutrient cycling and

468
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,050
moisture retention so there was a time

469
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,809
when I just used rye grass one time I

470
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:47,019
just planted a bunch of rye grass just

471
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:50,079
just specifically to kind of eliminate a

472
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:52,389
lot of the composting material that I

473
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,329
had because I had a problem with wood

474
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,970
louse of roly-polies and so I was trying

475
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,409
to eliminate

476
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,779
their food source you know is just kind

477
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,090
of messing around with things and I

478
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:05,089
didn't I didn't really like how the how

479
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:07,099
it felt and then what I what I got in

480
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:08,809
the end when the die-off happened I

481
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:11,000
ended up with just this huge Madoff

482
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:14,269
ryegrass and it just didn't really work

483
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,200
for me and and I've really learned that

484
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:20,799
the once again the greater diversity I

485
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,690
had the healthier things seemed to be

486
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,180
and that's when I started to include the

487
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,610
food crops that I don't really harvest I

488
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,880
just leave in to rot like the beets and

489
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:34,490
the daikon parsnips and those kinds of

490
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,570
things you know I think they're just

491
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:39,950
just wildly valuable to the soil that's

492
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:41,659
interesting that you leave them in

493
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,850
because I can see the advantages from

494
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,860
that of course as well I mean I like the

495
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:48,319
idea of of growing the food and being

496
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:50,059
able to extract extra value out of the

497
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,129
garden and also you know that the

498
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:53,960
novelty right oh hey look what I grew

499
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,360
next to my cannabis plants indoors right

500
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,110
that's kind of cool but the idea of

501
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:02,629
letting it go through its lifecycle and

502
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:04,189
then rotting there in the soil of course

503
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,130
that's going to create the opportunity

504
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:10,039
for so many micronutrients that you

505
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,980
wouldn't normally have so I mean now I

506
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:16,940
want to play with that sure yeah I think

507
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:20,380
of it as just varying the kind of the

508
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,490
new [ __ ] volumes in the earthworm

509
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,350
castings that with the natural earthworm

510
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,079
castings that we get you know if we give

511
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:29,779
them various food sources you know then

512
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:31,519
the the quality of the castings that we

513
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:35,139
get fresh from the source and the beds

514
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:41,180
it's going to be better so so you know

515
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:45,380
when we design our our arc of light if

516
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:47,930
we will for the cannabis plants and you

517
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,670
know I think I think you do 18-6 a lot

518
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,710
of folks do eighteen six and then we we

519
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:56,120
switch to twelve twelve for the bloom

520
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:58,519
but that's not really a true for a lot

521
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:02,479
of the plants that we are putting into

522
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:04,789
our poly culture and I'm curious what

523
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,460
your experience has been finding these

524
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:08,869
other plants these multitude of plants

525
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,630
that you're putting alongside the

526
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:13,169
cannabis

527
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,150
how do they react to 18 six and then

528
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,250
twelve twelve and specifically when you

529
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,980
flip because I would think that while we

530
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:23,130
do that to kind of startle the cannabis

531
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,410
plants to suddenly bloom that may well

532
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,030
freak out a lot of the companion plants

533
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,950
but I've never grown it at the level of

534
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:31,950
you have to like you know have a good

535
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,240
set of data no that's that's a really

536
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,930
good question I mean I what I've

537
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,109
observed over time is the like for

538
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,789
instance the broccoli never flowers it

539
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,979
just for whatever reason and I don't

540
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:46,139
know enough about how broccoli works

541
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,259
necessarily that it just is all it just

542
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,300
stays in this perpetual vegetative state

543
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:54,319
and so that's the one one thing that

544
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:57,149
I've noticed different it's hard to tell

545
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:59,970
what difference is what the differences

546
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:02,460
are attributed to when we flip flipped a

547
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:05,460
flower because the canopy is so dense by

548
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,710
that time that changes have kind of

549
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,049
already started to happen at the lower

550
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:13,079
levels before we even flipped it to

551
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:16,169
twelve and twelve because of the reduced

552
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:18,539
light so it's really difficult to say

553
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:21,300
you know there's a pretty drastic and

554
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:24,000
pronounced die-off you know late in veg

555
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,759
once the canopy is thick enough you know

556
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,250
to initiate flower at that point in time

557
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:33,930
they've been under reduced light for

558
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:36,029
several weeks and it it's really hard to

559
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,190
say what what light is doing at that

560
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:40,109
point yeah you got a lot of variables at

561
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,160
that point and no control group yeah

562
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:47,149
that's absolutely so as far as water

563
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,080
usage goes you know I find that

564
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,050
generally the way that I've done it in

565
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,269
the past kind of pre polyculture since

566
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:55,829
this is new to me as well but I have

567
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:58,319
found that indoor generally needs to be

568
00:23:55,829 --> 00:24:01,289
watered more than outdoor but when you

569
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:04,769
companion plant this much you know

570
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:07,230
you're retaining a lot of water and the

571
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:10,460
plants create that moist rainforest

572
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:13,410
effect at soil level so how does

573
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:17,759
planting polyculture impact the water

574
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:22,440
requirements it's it's incredible how

575
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,430
little water is needed for for a four by

576
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,370
eight bank

577
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:29,070
it's when it's properly cultivated the

578
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:31,169
the companion plants do such a good job

579
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:33,230
or even if you just used a straw mulch

580
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:37,080
and you weren't even companion planting

581
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:39,870
the anything covering the soil is gonna

582
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:43,109
help retain that moisture and help

583
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:47,369
prevent you know the transpiration of it

584
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:50,429
and and yeah so I get by like my home

585
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:54,000
grow I got three four by eight beds and

586
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:56,430
they're fed by a like a seven gallon

587
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,259
reservoir to bloom at drippers and if I

588
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,650
had to turn the water off that seven

589
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:05,009
gallons would last me four or five days

590
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:07,980
maybe even a week so the water

591
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:10,980
requirements are so nil and I think it's

592
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,990
just insanely valuable especially as we

593
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,839
you know when we start thinking about

594
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:18,380
conservation yeah that polyculture plus

595
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:21,299
bloom at really is a nice system

596
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,980
game-changer yeah totally so hey uh

597
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,419
we'll take our first short break and be

598
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,910
right back you're listening to shaping

599
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,980

regenerative cannabis agriculture are

603
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:38,730
surging in popularity and to implement

604
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,220
these biological solutions real science

605
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,170
education is vital if you are interested

606
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,880
in all things probiotic growing you will

607
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:47,610
probably want to attend the upcoming

623
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:20,190
there there will be a grower panel a

624

the

633
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:40,699

00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,560
importance of living soil when growing

660
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,630
cannabis when you have active microbe

661
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:41,700
communities in your substrate you go way

662
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,370
beyond simply fertilizing with nitrogen

663
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,019
phosphorus and potassium having active

664
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,879
microorganisms in your substrate

665
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:49,769
supports vigorous plant growth

666
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,130
throughout the plants root zone making

667
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:54,839
for higher yields and thriving flowers

668
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,360
mammoth pea is the first organically

669
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,799
derived microbial inoculant that focuses

670
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,409
on your plants nutrient cycling

671
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,149
processes to release soil phosphorus and

672
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,460
other micronutrients from they're bound

673
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:08,040
forms making them more available to the

674
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,720
plant increased levels of phosphorus

675
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,579
will also keep internode shorter and

676
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,740
focus your plants energy on bud

677
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:15,750
production not only that but the

678
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,000
microbes act as a defense shield for the

679
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,039
plants rise fear by out competing

680
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,539
potentially harmful pathogenic microbes

681
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,250
pretty cool right

682
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:25,409
mammoth pee not only unlocks the

683
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,289
nutrients in your soil but it also helps

684
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,269
protect your plant from disease mammoths

685
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,950
peas beneficial bacteria act like

686
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:34,349
microbial reactors

687
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,779
continually producing enzymes that

688
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:38,699
release nutrients mammoths pee was

689
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,920
developed at a u.s. university has been

690
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,259
extensively tested by Colorado growers

691
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,690
and independent laboratories mammoth pee

692
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:47,879
is proven to increase growth and enhance

693
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,740
blooming one of the great things about

694
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,700
supplementing with microorganisms is

695
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,079
that they won't come

696
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,630
Keit with whatever fertilizer program

697
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,429
you're already running simply dose on

698
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,800
top of your fertilizer schedule for

699

find out where you can buy namma pee

701

near you check out their website at WWF

702
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,269
microbes calm partner with

703
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,420
microorganisms to create beautiful

704
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:14,039
thriving cannabis mammoth pee welcome

705
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,170
back you are listening to shaping fire

706
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:18,000
and I'm your host Shango Lowe's and our

707
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:21,240
guest this week is Joshua Stein's 'land

708
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,180
lead cultivator at freshwater farms so

709
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,490
before the break we were talking about

710
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:30,990
the variety of polyculture plants and

711
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:34,049
the positive impacts that they offer in

712
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,480
your indoor grow I'm really curious when

713
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:39,450
you are choosing your plants for

714
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,809
integrated pest management did you

715
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:45,539
choose for all potential pests that

716
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:47,429
could happen or did you choose plants

717
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,529
that would be helpful for the ones that

718
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:52,560
you usually have to deal with locally in

719
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:56,670
your bio region well that's a good

720
00:29:52,559 --> 00:30:00,379
question I didn't give it a heck of a

721
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:03,930
lot of consideration aside from just

722
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,480
just basic knowledge like I meant I use

723
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:10,019
mint and marigold

724
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,009
at times mint has been my main kind of

725
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:16,920
IPM companion plant but but mainly I

726
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:22,379
tend to use companion plants less for

727
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:25,890
IPM and more for pests kind of like the

728
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,290
canary in the coal mine for pest ID I've

729
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,750
learned that clover flower when it's

730
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:34,920
allowed to flower really a the thrips

731
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:37,349
really like clover flowers so once you

732
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,940
have flowering clover if you it they're

733
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:42,659
gonna threats are gonna attack that

734
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:45,539
clover first spider might seem to really

735
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,100
like clover over cannabis as well so I

736
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:49,889
mean these are the those that's kind of

737
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:52,079
a low hanging fruit so to me the

738
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,900
companion plant is really more of an

739
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:57,299
observational tool to to kind of help me

740
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,730
see where we have a potential hot spot

741
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:01,889
and and then and also just knowing

742
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,049
things that like clover flower attracts

743
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,500
thrips you can take some preventative

744
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,750
measure

745
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,079
you're preventive IPM measures by adding

746
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:12,990
the proper beneficials say before your

747
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:16,199
clover is flowering to tackle the

748
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:19,109
potential influx of thrips I like that

749
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,700
idea of the plant as the canary and coal

750
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:23,279
mine because you know I had not really

751
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,480
considered that perspective in for when

752
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,849
planting companion plants to for ipm

753
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,400
normally it's either okay I'm gonna add

754
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:34,500
this plant because it gives off terpenes

755
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,600
that Ward's off pests right so that's

756
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,490
one kind and then and then just simple

757
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,409
trap plants which is kind of what you're

758
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:43,440
talking about about the clover flowers

759
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:45,630
because it will attract the thrips to

760
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,570
your clover flower instead of to your

761
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:51,480
cannabis but but this ID this additional

762
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:53,789
idea that oh it's a third you know these

763
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,930
these trap plants are actually a

764
00:31:53,789 --> 00:32:01,259
thermometer letting me know how how much

765
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:03,720
my my pest infants infestation is

766
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:06,900
because you know as as all of us living

767
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,220
soil folks know it's not about having

768
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,680
zero thrips

769
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,259
it's about keeping the thrips you have

770
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:17,220
in balance and never letting them you

771
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:20,190
know overrun the grow and I think that's

772
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,700
a really novel idea yeah it's it's it's

773
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:25,470
one of those things that you know clover

774
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,029
spider mites like the clover it doesn't

775
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,559
mean they're not going to make their way

776
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:30,930
on to your cannabis but they certainly

777
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,149
hit the clover first and same definitely

778
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,230
with the thrips and it's just one of

779
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,090
those deals where like I said the

780
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:37,860
low-hanging fruit and you if you're

781
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:40,439
observing that that's usually where

782
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:42,119
you're going to start to get your first

783
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,900
signs and indications and it's been an

784
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:47,879
insanely invaluable tool over the years

785
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:53,100
while we're talking about pests let's

786
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:55,980
let's talk about the use of of essential

787
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:57,299
oils so a lot of folks you know there's

788
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,360
there's a there's an ongoing debate

789
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:03,750
right people say that if you foliar feed

790
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:05,729
certain essential oils that the the

791
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,410
pests don't like it and so they'll avoid

792
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,559
your cannabis plants and certainly we're

793
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:13,050
talking about you know veg or only in

794
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,789
the first you know maybe week of flower

795
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:16,559
or not talking about late and flower but

796
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:17,759
but then other folks right the other

797
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,289
folks will say

798
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,720
nah nah you don't want to spray

799
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:24,450
essential oils on your plants because

800
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,120
the oils plug stomata and make it more

801
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,519
difficult for the plants to breathe and

802
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,250
and I've watched enough of the videos on

803
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,200
your fabulous YouTube channel to know

804
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:37,589
that you've got a pretty strong

805
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,019
understanding of cannabis botany itself

806
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:44,639
so so what were your thoughts to be on

807
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:48,059
this ongoing debate um well I think I

808
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,240
think context is important here I mean

809
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:53,009
if if if we're talking about just you

810
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,349
know you're like if we're talking about

811
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:57,269
like say a method one PPS which is

812
00:33:55,349 --> 00:34:01,709
essential oils and I think a little bit

813
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:03,539
of alcohol you know I have no problem

814
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:06,450
with those I I think that there is a

815
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:08,369
potential before cuz they save me Moyles

816
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,079
or some just really heavily applied

817
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:12,418
essential oils to clog the stomata

818
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,549
especially if you're using them in in

819
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:18,929
succession like you're just one

820
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:20,460
essential oil spray after another yeah I

821
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:24,480
think there's a potential for buildup

822
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:26,190
and and impossible stomata blockage but

823
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,730
I think that if you're if you're IPM

824
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:31,829
practices we're such that you're hitting

825
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,740
it with an essential oil on day one

826
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:37,769
and so maybe day three doing like an

827
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:40,648
aloe rinse on your leaves or whatever as

828
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:43,110
a foliar like that those if you're

829
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:45,000
practicing your IPM in that fashion I

830
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:47,190
think if that's drastically gonna reduce

831
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,829
the possibility of that happening I

832
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,929
think that if you went with kind of a

833
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:55,110
commercially produced oil product those

834
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:58,470
tend to be really light in the oils it's

835
00:34:55,110 --> 00:35:00,240
going to be your DIY guys that might go

836
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:02,909
a little heavy with the oils and whatnot

837
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,369
or and they could run into potential

838
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:08,460
issues but I think I think adding a

839
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:10,829
rinse is important yeah I have been that

840
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,780
place myself when I was more of a rookie

841
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:15,029
than I am now where it's like well if it

842
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,830
says this much is good if I add three

843
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:19,320
times that amount it's gonna be triple

844
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:20,940
strength you know but in the end it

845
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,580
doesn't really work and like most of

846
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,159
these ideas that we're talking about

847
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:27,719
it's about balance right so an error

848
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,879
moderation is what I meant to say

849
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,759
moderation so so yeah if you're going to

850
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,490
use these faux layers

851
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,920
mmm use them in moderation don't plan on

852
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:40,409
leaning on them to do to do all the

853
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,950
lifting definitely definitely less is

854
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:45,000
more

855
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:46,589
aye it's easier to add than subtract in

856
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,530
situations like this if you've overdone

857
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:52,050
it it's especially with foliar feeding

858
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:54,210
or with with IPM or even like if if

859
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:57,000
you're feeding some kind of bottled

860
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,220
nutrient regime it's it's always you

861
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,079
always want to start with less because

862
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:03,059
it's easier to add the things that maybe

863
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,889
you didn't get in the first time than it

864
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:06,570
is to kind of take it back once you've

865
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:12,329
applied it to the plant yeah it's way

866
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:14,820
hard to take so you know pretty much

867
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:16,650
everybody has been in the situation

868
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,580
where they're they're late into bloom

869
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:22,980
and you get a pest infestation at you

870
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:25,019
know the worst possible time and and

871
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,110
granted you know if if you've got a

872
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:31,619
clean room if you've got you know IPM

873
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:35,340
plants planted if you are are doing

874
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:37,619
foliar zin in vegetative state if you

875
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,900
are you know if you're doing all of this

876
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,150
stuff your likelihood should be very low

877
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,530
however you know sometimes bad things

878
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:46,920
happen to good people

879
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:48,690
so so if you were to get an infestation

880
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,450
let's just pick spider mites but you can

881
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,220
give you know whatever example you most

882
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:56,699
appropriate to you but something like

883
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:58,169
that in weak safe or where you're not

884
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,730
going to be doing a lot of these sprays

885
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,889
because it'll mess with the taste of the

886
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,289
flowers and then could potentially risk

887
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:06,329
molds then because the the flowers will

888
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:09,269
be getting wet what are your go-to

889
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:12,358
solutions at that point where everything

890
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:14,699
is so limited our options yeah I mean I

891
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:16,529
think if nobody wants to be in that

892
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:19,529
position and it's um

893
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:21,869
you have to kind of just gauge how how

894
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,480
severe your infestation is and in the

895
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:27,210
the beautiful thing about about this

896
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,309
situation is is it if you've had had

897
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:32,070
good practices like you were saying up

898
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:35,099
to it's up to four weeks and you just

899
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:37,019
got kind of an incidental exposure back

900
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:39,858
and that could be pretty easily fixed

901
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:42,719
with a heavy dose of beneficial

902
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:45,059
predators you know that that's pretty

903
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:48,629
much your only go-to in this in this

904
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:50,219
instance and you know if if you're at

905
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,890
week four and you have a severe

906
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:56,819
infestation with webbing and whatnot you

907
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:59,909
messed up somewhat so so there's some

908
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,680
serious user error so if that week four

909
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:05,219
you've got just kind of a light little

910
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:07,199
hotspot in your grow you know things to

911
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:10,259
consider are hitting it with a very

912
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:15,089
heavy dose of it like you know facility

913
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:18,359
really like very hungry predators or

914
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,829
just kind of rooting that spot out and

915
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:22,349
cutting it out and cutting your losses

916
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:24,000
so if it's one or two plants in the back

917
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:26,759
of your greenhouse or one or two plants

918
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,619
in one of your beds it might be worth it

919
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,000
to just kind of cut your losses get rid

920
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:34,530
of the ones that that could be

921
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,920
problematic but I tend to want to throw

922
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,570
live stuff at it and and try my luck

923
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,760
with that I'm glad you mentioned the

924
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,740
beneficials because I've become a big

925
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,550
fan of beneficials and this year was the

926
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:49,679
first year that I used them heavily from

927
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,230
veg all the way through the end with

928
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,239
three different applications and it was

929
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,219
it was delightful I didn't have any pest

930
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:59,099
issues this year which was like

931
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:01,500
astonishing and fantastic so did you

932
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,139
find that your companion plants

933
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,030
especially the trap plants we're also

934
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:08,519
attracting your beneficials or were you

935
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:13,170
able to choose trap plants that were

936
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:15,179
more interested that the pests were more

937
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,880
interested in them than any of the

938
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:20,519
beneficials you are using well that's a

939
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,200
good question I I think that any time

940
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:26,960
that I've had that experience where I've

941
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:30,329
seen it on the clover we took really

942
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,970
quick and decisive action so we didn't

943
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:35,579
really don't give it much time to to

944
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:37,500
observe whether it liked the cannabis

945
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,989
more or what are the Predators had more

946
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:43,739
of an effect at first the first sign of

947
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:46,889
any kind of nonsense we just throw an

948
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:49,169
obscene amount of bugs at it and and and

949
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:51,529
that you that every time has done the

950
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:54,090
trick you know I really think that I

951
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:57,480
would love to be able to do a no spray

952
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:58,170
IPM on the commercial scale and I think

953
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,800
it's dual

954
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:04,740
I think that no-spray IPM is is really

955
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,600
the most ideal way to go about that way

956
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:09,419
you can just focus on your foliar

957
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,449
feeding and and know that your pests are

958
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:14,070
are handled by the Predators but

959
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:16,139
unfortunately a lot of times like in our

960
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,990
situation to freshwater farms we are in

961
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:22,379
or we're surrounded by hemp fields and

962
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:25,769
we're also surrounded by other cultivate

963
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,750
cultivation facilities and so it it

964
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:29,340
became really apparent to us in our

965
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,489
first cycle that we were not going to be

966
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:35,970
able to get away with a no spraying IPM

967
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:39,449
that because the influx of bad guys was

968
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:41,699
just more than we could throw bugs at

969
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:45,210
that's an interesting idea the idea that

970
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:47,309
you know if you were by yourself over

971
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,440
there that you would not attract nearly

972
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:52,019
as many from all the dirty ass forearms

973
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,840
around you yeah absolutely absolutely

974
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:56,969
well you know and I've got no you know

975
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,500
no no problem with anybody else I think

976
00:40:56,969 --> 00:41:00,359
that there's just kind of a natural

977
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,460
thing that happens to you know you get

978
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,380
that many cannabis plants in one area

979
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,409
they just send a signal out you know

980
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,940
they the bugs just know like oh in that

981
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:11,369
building there's a bunch or there's a

982
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,559
huge hint field so everywhere in the

983
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:15,000
area they're just kind of migrating that

984
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:17,880
way and they just find their way into

985
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,059
the facilities so during the first set

986
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,039
we were talking about water and how

987
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:24,869
between all of the companion plants and

988
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:27,239
the blue mats that your water

989
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:29,069
requirements are actually really low I

990
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:31,829
wondered what your thoughts were about

991
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,630
nutrients because for folks new to

992
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:35,969
companion planning it's a pretty common

993
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,250
push back for them to say well you know

994
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:40,349
my nutrients are really expensive and I

995
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,530
don't want them to be all taken up by

996
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:46,650
the companion plants and and and I get

997
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:48,030
that I usually start with hmm what

998
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,809
nutrients are you're buying that are so

999
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,780
expensive right

1000
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:54,420
but but to their point I was curious if

1001
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:58,440
you find that to what degree the

1002
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:01,680
companion plants swipe nutrients from

1003
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,619
the cannabis plants and so how does that

1004
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,599
impact your feeding sure that that's a

1005
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,579
that's a good consideration to have I

1006
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,639
mean I I had the same thoughts when I

1007
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:15,509
was first getting into this and I think

1008
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:18,569
I think we as a whole don't really

1009
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:22,380
understand the vastness of what's

1010
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:25,110
available in the soil and and in a

1011
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,539
properly amended soil so like in my

1012
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:30,150
situation we don't I know that tad would

1013
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:32,909
keep it simple he always recommends that

1014
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:35,660
we remanned every cycle and and I really

1015
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:38,819
value his opinion but I I really hold

1016
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:42,690
fast to my minimalist approach and we do

1017
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:44,280
it every other cycle and and we're still

1018
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,309
finding that even though we're waiting

1019
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,370
you know six months basically are

1020
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:53,219
amending our beds twice a year that

1021
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:56,279
there's plenty to go around in that six

1022
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:58,500
months and you just kind of have faith

1023
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,390
you gotta have faith in the in the

1024
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,820
process and the system and know that

1025
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:04,829
those those plants they're there they

1026
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,870
are up taking some minerals and some

1027
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:09,779
nutrients but they're also going to give

1028
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:11,699
it back in that cycling process you know

1029
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,160
and even if you were cutting down your

1030
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:16,139
cover crop and then fermenting it and

1031
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,509
applying it back to your soil as a tea

1032
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:19,949
you know you can you can capture all you

1033
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,690
can capture a percentage of those

1034
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:24,000
nutrients that the plants took and give

1035
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,010
it back or just allow the plant to give

1036
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,860
it back when it when you go through your

1037
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,840
die-off process so going further down

1038
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:35,309
that line of thought you know when when

1039
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:37,500
when people ask me about the nutrients

1040
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:40,349
that the companion plants take up and

1041
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,329
and it's taking away from my cannabis

1042
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:44,789
plant what I normally tell them is if if

1043
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:47,130
you are going to go to the point of

1044
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:50,989
having companion plants and to be

1045
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:55,260
feeding the whole bed a natural diet

1046
00:43:50,989 --> 00:43:57,359
whatever you are out financially for the

1047
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,180
nutrients that the companion plants are

1048
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:04,430
going to uptake you will end up

1049
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:09,839
receiving far far more from the

1050
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:12,000
additional micronutrients and nutrients

1051
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,850
that are germane to the soil that will

1052
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,400
be created because you've got all these

1053
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:19,769
additional plants and and and the

1054
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,559
mycelium that comes with it and they are

1055
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:24,599
you know all the additional microbes so

1056
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,369
so you may be putting in some new

1057
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,588
and those plants maybe taking them up

1058
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:30,749
but the symphony like you were talking

1059
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:32,759
about will actually cause far more

1060
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:35,188
nutrients than you paid to put in the

1061
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:37,259
backs absolutely it's over unity it's an

1062
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:38,428
investment you know it's just like in

1063
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:40,168
the old days when I used to own a

1064
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:42,568
brick-and-mortar hydroponic shop in

1065
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:44,699
Southern Oregon and you know the thing

1066
00:44:42,568 --> 00:44:46,168
we would always say is you know if

1067
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:47,548
you're in here spending a thousand

1068
00:44:46,168 --> 00:44:48,748
dollars you shouldn't feel terrible

1069
00:44:47,548 --> 00:44:50,818
because that thousand dollars is going

1070
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:53,129
to earn you ten thousand you know so

1071
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:55,079
it's kind of a similar thought process

1072
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,088
you know what you've got to sacrifice a

1073
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,160
little but in the bigger picture you

1074
00:44:57,088 --> 00:45:01,768
know you get more in the end so that's

1075
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:04,318
really really well put I like that so

1076
00:45:01,768 --> 00:45:07,108
along that same vein my favorite part of

1077
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,150
poly culture is the interplay of the

1078
00:45:07,108 --> 00:45:13,199
roots of the different plants right and

1079
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:15,239
and you know my science knowledge is is

1080
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:18,088
growing but I would still call it

1081
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:21,528
somewhat limited so so at a certain it's

1082
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:24,239
like when when you know people say any

1083
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:26,119
justifiably evolved technology is

1084
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,278
indistinguishable from magic

1085
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:31,798
you know it's for me soil science still

1086
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:34,409
I since I consider myself still a novice

1087
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:36,719
at a certain point I get down a level of

1088
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:38,789
a detail and then it's just magic right

1089
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:42,749
so so one of my favorite parts is the

1090
00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:46,140
interplay of roots and mycelium and the

1091
00:45:42,748 --> 00:45:48,058
soil through the soil and the

1092
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:50,188
rhizosphere of speaking you know these

1093
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:52,589
these networks where they're they're

1094
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:54,748
moving around nutrients and then they're

1095
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:58,409
sending signals about pests that are on

1096
00:45:54,748 --> 00:46:00,988
the other side of the bed and for some

1097
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:03,568
because of some reason this the symphony

1098
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:07,019
as you put it it really seems to

1099
00:46:03,568 --> 00:46:10,259
increase the thriving nature of the

1100
00:46:07,018 --> 00:46:14,068
entirety of the bed even though this is

1101
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:16,559
mostly invisible to us so over time you

1102
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:18,808
know I know that you spent a lot of time

1103
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,119
with your beds and you've got you know

1104
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:23,699
at this point decades of experience so

1105
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,429
as the cultivator over time can you

1106
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:29,039
sense any of that activity below the

1107
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:32,249
soil and since you're with them for such

1108
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:35,939
long periods of time yeah I mean without

1109
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:38,459
sounding too you know starry-eyed youth

1110
00:46:35,938 --> 00:46:41,710
there's definitely

1111
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,849
there's something that happens when you

1112
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:45,990
like when you feel like you've achieved

1113
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:48,910
homeostasis and everything is just

1114
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:51,758
firing on all cinder cylinders your

1115
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:53,318
plants and your yourse there's this kind

1116
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:55,210
of iridescent that happens with your

1117
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:57,759
plants the lipid layers on your cannabis

1118
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:59,349
are thick and beautiful and and it's

1119
00:46:57,759 --> 00:47:01,528
when you show people pictures they're

1120
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:05,650
just like oh my gosh supreme health like

1121
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:08,679
it's that feeling you get when you look

1122
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:11,858
at a plant that's just you can tell that

1123
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:14,440
it's at its maximum genetic potential is

1124
00:47:11,858 --> 00:47:16,328
expressed you know there's just a

1125
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,670
feeling that happens and and I think

1126
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:21,220
that's what caused a lot of us to this

1127
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:24,190
living soil process it allowed a lot of

1128
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:26,230
us to kind of put our ego aside cause

1129
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:28,960
it's really hard really to take credit

1130
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,579
for the cannabis that I've that I grow

1131
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,170
in these systems because I literally

1132
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:39,430
don't do anything I literally plant them

1133
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:41,650
in and observe I mean I'll lop I'll thin

1134
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:43,419
a little bit but I'm not in there

1135
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,849
fussing over things and I'm not and I'm

1136
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,829
just observing in that and that's that's

1137
00:47:45,849 --> 00:47:50,829
when having the trust in the in the

1138
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:52,568
process and having faith in that magic

1139
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:54,369
that happens because I'm no I'm no soil

1140
00:47:52,568 --> 00:47:55,929
scientist I'm a high school graduate and

1141
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:57,910
I went to I went to school for I went to

1142
00:47:55,929 --> 00:47:59,889
a trade school for audio engineering so

1143
00:47:57,909 --> 00:48:03,159
you know I'm Pro Tools certified I have

1144
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:06,639
no idea about the soil science right I

1145
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:09,940
just know what has worked and from what

1146
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,889
my you know very basic understanding and

1147
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,778
I think you know your actual soil

1148
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,940
scientists themselves like dr. Elaine

1149
00:48:13,778 --> 00:48:18,309
Ingham in and lo and fells they'll be

1150
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,730
the first ones to tell you that we're

1151
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:23,619
only at they are only at a ten percent

1152
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:25,719
knowledge of what's happening so there's

1153
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:28,630
still a lot of magic that needs to be

1154
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:30,759
deciphered there so even though that you

1155
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,798
say that you you don't mess with it much

1156
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:34,420
and then earlier on you said that that

1157
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:36,219
you're kind of past your days of

1158
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,079
bothering about pH because of how you

1159
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:41,409
grow your pH is going to be correct and

1160
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:45,009
stable I'm curious where you fall I mean

1161
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:47,018
how regularly do you test your soil this

1162
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:49,900
is something that I wanted to tighten up

1163
00:48:47,018 --> 00:48:50,308
on my regime at my home grow I've never

1164
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,949
test

1165
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:55,140
in my soil so my soil has been in I know

1166
00:48:52,949 --> 00:48:57,329
Todd has been really wanting me to get

1167
00:48:55,139 --> 00:49:00,208
oil samples in just just to kind of get

1168
00:48:57,329 --> 00:49:02,219
the data because I've been I'm over

1169
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:03,719
three years on these beds and I just

1170
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:05,188
have kind of like if the plants look

1171
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:07,858
like they're doing good I'm not fussing

1172
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:09,989
about it but now that we're on this

1173
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:12,208
commercial level of fresh water we're

1174
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:13,769
going to start to implement you know at

1175
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:16,919
least twice a year

1176
00:49:13,768 --> 00:49:19,438
soil samples and soil analysis so we can

1177
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,959
kind of see what's being consumed what's

1178
00:49:19,438 --> 00:49:23,639
being left behind and then maybe move

1179
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:26,429
forward with kind of a more

1180
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:29,038
conscientious amending as opposed to

1181
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:30,629
just kind of throwing a basic amending

1182
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,999
kit that's kind of got a little bit of

1183
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:35,818
everything you know

1184
00:49:32,998 --> 00:49:38,998
it's a soil analysis I think it's

1185
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:41,880
crucial for data and crucial for moving

1186
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:43,409
forward and keeping costs down and those

1187
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,539
kind of things because now that we're

1188
00:49:43,409 --> 00:49:47,129
not black market or medical you know

1189
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:48,569
we're really concerned with cost of

1190
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:53,239
goods produced and all these type of

1191
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:55,798
things so analysis and data is crucial

1192
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:59,309
taken another step down this this

1193
00:49:55,798 --> 00:50:02,728
science path you know when when in

1194
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:05,189
medical days in each state before the

1195
00:50:02,728 --> 00:50:08,009
heavy regulation and taxing comes along

1196
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:11,639
we all had a lot more flexibility in our

1197
00:50:08,009 --> 00:50:13,289
grow locations and so places that I have

1198
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:17,699
worked in places that I have visited

1199
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:19,949
very often we I would see two stations

1200
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:22,409
there would be a dab station and then

1201
00:50:19,949 --> 00:50:24,088
there would be a science station and and

1202
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:25,409
and and you know they'd have a rig on

1203
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:28,259
one side and then they'd have a

1204
00:50:25,409 --> 00:50:29,879
microscope on the other side so I was

1205
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:31,829
curious you know clearly you know you

1206
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,259
can't have the dab station anymore under

1207
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:36,390
under the new regulations but but

1208
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:40,920
perhaps you are the kind of guy who

1209
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:42,688
keeps a microscope station in case you

1210
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,519
know maybe maybe to check out your bugs

1211
00:50:42,688 --> 00:50:46,969
or what everything so I was curious if

1212
00:50:44,518 --> 00:50:52,318
you if you keep a microscope in the grow

1213
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:54,239
we I have a like your little USB 400 x

1214
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,509
scope that you see lots of folks have

1215
00:50:54,239 --> 00:51:00,719
and I think that sometime in the next

1216
00:50:56,509 --> 00:51:03,269
six months to a year I'm definitely

1217
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,019
going to be interested in taking some

1218
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:07,139
actual

1219
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:09,480
courses on microscopy because Elena

1220
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:10,980
Ingham has some really good courses and

1221
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,170
I'd like to get into that because I

1222
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,179
think that that's kind of that's the

1223
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,920
next level is being able that's why one

1224
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:20,519
of the reasons why I don't like doing

1225
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:22,380
aerated compost teas because I just

1226
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:24,210
don't you don't know what you're getting

1227
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,730
really until you can get in there and

1228
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:30,389
look at what you're actually cultivating

1229
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:33,240
in that tea and so I've been hesitant to

1230
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:36,059
go down that route simply because my

1231
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:38,609
skillset just kind of didn't didn't

1232
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:40,289
allow for me to know exactly what was

1233
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:43,019
happening in the soil I think it's a

1234
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:45,119
very very valuable skill to have and

1235
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:49,110
it's something that I'm definitely going

1236
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:52,199
to be putting into my future toolkit

1237
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:53,700
isn't it cool that so much what what

1238
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:56,369
I'll just throw in one big basket and

1239
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:59,669
called soil science that this stuff is

1240
00:51:56,369 --> 00:52:02,339
becoming so much more available to all

1241
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:04,680
of us you know when when cannabis had to

1242
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:06,600
be you know in the dark and in the

1243
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:09,119
Prohibition days and even farther back

1244
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,549
when all we could find was you know a

1245
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:14,369
column or two in High Times magazines in

1246
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:16,830
the Stone Age right nowadays though not

1247
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:20,039
only can we talk more publicly about

1248
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:23,190
soil cultivation and soil science as it

1249
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:25,019
relates to cannabis but now like you

1250
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,820
know you mentioned Elaine you know you

1251
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:29,039
can you can take her classes you can

1252
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:32,600
take her online classes there's uh

1253
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:35,400
there's that great traveling science

1254
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:37,429
classes that Joshua Rutherford is

1255
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,440
running what is that organic

1256
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:41,789
regenerative cannabis calm I think but

1257
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,280
he's you know he's taking these soil

1258
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:46,259
scientists and you know taking them

1259
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,750
across the country so people you know in

1260
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,640
Michigan and and Maine can get the same

1261
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:54,510
kind of stuff too it really is a game

1262
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:56,279
changer I think from everybody from you

1263
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:58,110
know the high commercial level who

1264
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,030
certainly needs it but really you know

1265
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:02,730
so many patient and just you know

1266
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:04,380
enthusiastic home growers are diving

1267
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:06,179
into the soil science which always

1268
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:10,769
brings me back to the idea that that

1269
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:13,049
really cannabis cultivation is a you

1270
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:17,269
know is an entryway to all sorts of

1271
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:18,980
horticulture yo absolutely yeah I really

1272
00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:22,340
love what Joshua was doing I went to his

1273
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:24,710
first one last year in in Portland and

1274
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:28,100
he's he's got such a great vision and

1275
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:29,570
really proud to know him and happy that

1276
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:33,739
he's doing that because you're right

1277
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:35,120
this is uh it's a very interesting time

1278
00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:36,649
because you've we have a lot of people

1279
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,319
we touched on it earlier a lot of people

1280
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:42,200
that are just kind of sick of the system

1281
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:46,010
as it is as it's been presented and are

1282
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:49,129
realizing that there's a safer way to

1283
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:52,360
produce your medicine or to produce your

1284
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:55,940
cannabis and and not have to sacrifice

1285
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:57,740
yields or or anything you actually it's

1286
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,720
a win-win you're producing a safer

1287
00:53:57,739 --> 00:54:03,109
higher-quality medicine and it's and

1288
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:03,589
it's a better product than you would

1289
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:06,650
otherwise

1290
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:09,440
and and in doing so I've seen lots of

1291
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:11,990
people go from cannabis and now they've

1292
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,099
got Hugo culture vegie beds and and

1293
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:19,069
they're they're taking this living soil

1294
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:21,099
idea and bringing it once again back to

1295
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:24,050
the old days like this is how we grew

1296
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:26,179
you know before commercial fertilizers

1297
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:28,670
so that so it's people are just really

1298
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:32,690
reclaiming our past and there's this

1299
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:34,940
kind of maybe this inherit nostalgia

1300
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:37,010
that happens you know when we when we

1301
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:39,650
participate in that yeah I want to I

1302
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:41,900
want to go back and fix the URL that I

1303
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:43,010
put out cuz I'm sure that that Joshua is

1304
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,519
out there listening to this going you

1305
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:47,930
gave the wrong domain because I wasn't

1306
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:49,940
planning on mentioning it so it wasn't

1307
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:53,629
in my notes but but it's regenerative

1308
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:55,039
organic cannabis dot-com and so he's

1309
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:57,349
doing four or five of these that are

1310
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,239
gunner going across the entire US and

1311
00:54:57,349 --> 00:55:01,250
he's bringing people like you know Kevin

1312
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:03,529
Joe jury and laying Ingham with him

1313
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,960
across the country that's super cool so

1314
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:07,910
so let's go ahead and take our second

1315
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,559
commercial break you are listening to

1316
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:12,379
shaping fire and my guest today is

1317
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:15,320
Joshua Stein's Lindh lead cultivator at

1318
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,910
freshwater farms now that the health

1319
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,769
benefits of terpenes have become well

1320
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:20,389
known in the cannabis industry people

1321
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:23,000
everywhere are looking for the purest

1322
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:24,500
terpenes without adulterants the problem

1323
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,119
with most terpene providers is that

1324
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,889
they're not sourced naturally and

1325
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:30,659
instead are made as a byproduct of

1326
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:32,848
refining petroleum and that's so sketchy

1327
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:34,858
the terpenes sold by true terpenes are

1328
00:55:32,849 --> 00:55:37,829
entirely different they are certified

1329
00:55:34,858 --> 00:55:39,420
organic non-gmo and food grade that

1330
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:41,849
means that they are extracted from real

1331
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,068
plant sources there are no solvents of

1332
00:55:41,849 --> 00:55:47,009
any kind they are distilled only with

1333
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:49,440
steam that's right only steam in fact

1334
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:51,659
terpenes from true turbines are so pure

1335
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,460
that you can eat them not only that but

1336
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:56,338
you can stack them with better results -

1337
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:58,380
what I mean is other company's terpenes

1338
00:55:56,338 --> 00:56:00,239
have got a few percent of impurities and

1339
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,309
when you stack those terpenes to make

1340
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,108
your blend you're adding a variety of

1341
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:06,809
impurities that degrade your final

1342
00:56:04,108 --> 00:56:08,730
product true terpenes also have strange

1343
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:10,559
specific terpenes for a wide range of

1344
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:12,920
cannabis strains like Durbin poison

1345
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,900
sunset sherbet and granddaddy purple

1346

does you've got so many responsibilities

1371
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:15,539
every single day that often you just

1372

don't have the time to really dig into

00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,289
time for it and you're not really ready

1379

website very pretty

1387

proving your bottom line up to you they

1389
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,809
don't want that kind of responsibility

1390
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,780

1408
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,619
Kirsten and her team put together a

00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:34,659
whole brand package for them built their

1410
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:37,239
website and wrote their sales materials

1411
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:38,769
no doubt this is a paid commercial spot

1412
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:40,750
but that does not mean that they bought

1413
00:58:38,769 --> 00:58:42,429
my opinion I've worked with blunt

1414
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,469
branding on four projects now for

1415
00:58:42,429 --> 00:58:45,669
various clients and every single time

1416
00:58:44,469 --> 00:58:47,980
they have done more than they've

1417
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:50,559
promised and over delivered on results I

1418
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:52,690
love how they generate new revenue and

1419
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,269
focus on that as the goal instead of

1420
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:57,099
just making you a pretty logo similarly

1421
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:59,259

addition to all this groundbreaking

1443
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:46,780
polyculture stuff that you're doing and

1444
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:48,160
the fact that you're doing it indoors is

1445
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:50,890
even more mind-blowing

1446
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:54,250
you're also no-till and no-till is

1447
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:56,349
becoming exceptionally popular and so

1448
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:58,269
would you just take a moment and

1449
00:59:56,349 --> 01:00:01,599
explain a little bit about how you're

1450
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:04,239
implementing no-till in your 4x8 beds

1451
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:07,179
and what you're planting and harvesting

1452
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:09,939
processes look like yeah yeah yeah no

1453
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:14,919
toe has really become kind of a buzzword

1454
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:18,340
as of late over the past couple years so

1455
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:22,510
when I think of no-till I literally

1456
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:27,370
think of not tilling so you know I try

1457
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:31,450
to when I plant my my crop plants my

1458
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:35,799
cannabis I will put them in the ground

1459
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:37,779
in a small container as possible so if I

1460
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:41,080
can if I can take my cuttings in clone

1461
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:43,780
form as just rooted cubes or rooted

1462
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:46,259
cuttings I'll put those directly into my

1463
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:49,210
beds because I don't want to displace

1464
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:51,280
any of that soil that were we were

1465
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:54,099
talking earlier about the the fungal

1466
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,180
components and the bacterial components

1467
01:00:54,099 --> 01:01:01,269
you don't want to disturb that delicate

1468
01:00:57,179 --> 01:01:05,259
system like if we had 1 gallon pots and

1469
01:01:01,269 --> 01:01:07,929
we had 24 or 18 plants in a 4 by 8 bed

1470
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:13,210
or even 12 in a 4 by 8 bed you're

1471
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:17,049
displacing 12 gallons of medium that was

1472
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:19,510
in the beds happy doing its thing and

1473
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:21,640
you just tearing it up and displacing it

1474
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:25,510
you know and and I think ultimately

1475
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:27,819
that's not it's not the end of the world

1476
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:31,270
your beds will recover but I think over

1477
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:33,090
time there's this cumulative benefit

1478
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:37,150
that happens to really just allowing

1479
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:39,760
that soil structure to remain intact you

1480
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:41,889
know if you haven't disturbed areas of

1481
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,740
the bed for over three years you can

1482
01:01:41,889 --> 01:01:46,659
imagine the the strength of that

1483
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:49,029
communication network that resides in

1484
01:01:46,659 --> 01:01:50,349
there is gonna be pretty fast yeah it's

1485
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:53,019
like it's like oh we've got all this

1486
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:55,420
mycelium superhighways why on earth

1487
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:57,699
would we break that up and then start

1488
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,369
over every year when when we already

1489
01:01:57,699 --> 01:02:03,099
have all that maturity in the soil

1490
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:05,769
exactly yeah so so ok so if if your

1491
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:08,289
optimum situation is just to create a

1492
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:08,889
little opening and put a bare root it'ld

1493
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:12,250
start

1494
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:16,170
in there how do you go about amending

1495
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:20,019
your beds without disturbing the soil

1496
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:23,980
sure yeah I tend to just top dress and

1497
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:26,500
so when I amend I I once again I tend to

1498
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:29,829
under amend I know that it's been

1499
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:34,690
recommended that you do about 14 pounds

1500
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:39,670
of dry nutrients and minerals per 4 by 8

1501
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:42,220
bed I do about seven and so I do half of

1502
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:43,809
what's been recommended from tatak kiss

1503
01:02:42,219 --> 01:02:46,719
and then we've been doing quite well

1504
01:02:43,809 --> 01:02:48,639
with that once again and I just top

1505
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:51,609
dressed top dress and maybe sprinkle it

1506
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:54,069
a little in and then what happens is the

1507
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:56,349
cover crop will kind of grow over it and

1508
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:59,710
that the soil life just kind of pulls it

1509
01:02:56,349 --> 01:03:02,469
in oh that's interesting good Wow hmm

1510
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:04,449
well that that actually speaks to my

1511
01:03:02,469 --> 01:03:06,339
next question which was how do you

1512
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:09,339
actually do it because all right so

1513
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:12,970
let's say that today your you harvest

1514
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:15,100
and you're going to start a new cycle in

1515
01:03:12,969 --> 01:03:17,799
just a couple days what a lot of people

1516
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:20,739
will do is is top dress and then kind of

1517
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:23,019
flood it with water to to cause the

1518
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:24,789
nutrients to soak in more but then

1519
01:03:23,019 --> 01:03:27,239
you've got a really wet bed and so you

1520
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:30,340
need to let that even out a little bit

1521
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:35,099
but I like your idea that you are using

1522
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:39,190
a less top dress over a wider area

1523
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:42,579
watering regular and then the idea that

1524
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:45,970
the soil comes up and and sucks it down

1525
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:47,610
you know it takes it itself right yeah

1526
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:50,829
that's that's kind of the the the

1527
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:52,510
visualization I have is like is that

1528
01:03:50,829 --> 01:03:53,860
really just like the worms will make

1529
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:55,480
their way up to the surface they'll

1530
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,160
they'll know that the kelp is there the

1531
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,199
crab meal is there they'll come up there

1532
01:03:57,159 --> 01:04:00,849
they'll start to consume it the process

1533
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:04,329
of them making their way to the surface

1534
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:06,569
and then and then heading back down

1535
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:09,489
again is going to pull some of that down

1536
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:11,920
and then just the natural person a

1537
01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:13,899
chiral microbial activity is going to

1538
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,230
just break it down and and you'll get

1539
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:19,000
like a kind of a precipitation so let's

1540
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:21,679
select so we talked about the the

1541
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,199
beginning of the cycle for no too

1542
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:26,449
let's talk the end of the cycle of

1543
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:29,449
no-till so so what does your no-till

1544
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:32,539
Harvest look like sure um it's just like

1545
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:34,579
any anybody else we I don't do I want

1546
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:36,380
don't do it dry out or any kind of weird

1547
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:38,480
stressing

1548
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:40,970
I shouldn't say weird cuz some people do

1549
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,250
it and they like it it's just for a

1550
01:04:40,969 --> 01:04:45,049
living soil bed it I don't like to

1551
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,610
stress temperature stress the plants

1552
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:49,010
because I don't want to affect the soil

1553
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:51,820
temperature and obvi for obvious reasons

1554
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:55,820
I don't want to dry out or over you know

1555
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:58,670
over stress that that soil microbiome so

1556
01:04:55,820 --> 01:05:00,590
with no-till it's literally just cutting

1557
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:03,340
the plant right at the soil level and

1558
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:07,490
then proceed with your dry and cure

1559
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:10,370
methods as normal and then after that is

1560
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:13,909
in my particular methodology in my

1561
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:16,480
minimalist kind of water only thought

1562
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:19,549
process and our methodology is we just

1563
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:22,400
will re amend at that time once we have

1564
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:24,769
no cash crop in the bed at that time

1565
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,690
we've harvested then I'll do my area

1566
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:28,849
mend mean amendment if it's after the

1567
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:30,800
second cycle and then I'll let it sit

1568
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:33,440
for about a week before I transplant the

1569
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:35,660
clones in and that's just kind of the

1570
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,940
ease my mind I don't feel like the

1571
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:40,579
nutrients amendments that we use are

1572
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:42,710
necessarily hot or would or would be a

1573
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:46,429
detriment I just kind of like to give

1574
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:48,590
the soil time to acclimate to its its

1575
01:05:46,429 --> 01:05:51,649
new influx of nutrients and minerals

1576
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:54,470
before putting the plug in the plants in

1577
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:57,559
do you pull the root ball and plant in

1578
01:05:54,469 --> 01:05:59,959
its place or do you plant beside the

1579
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:01,759
former root ball we plant beside the

1580
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:05,360
former root ball once again we don't

1581
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:08,990
want to disturb that kind of that that

1582
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:12,340
delicate infrastructure in there and the

1583
01:06:08,989 --> 01:06:15,319
the roots become worm food and they also

1584
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:19,610
leave air cavities in there for aeration

1585
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:21,500
and water to flow it's just a really

1586
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:23,809
good thing to leave in your soil I

1587
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:26,480
always I just drove by a hint field

1588
01:06:23,809 --> 01:06:29,840
recently and they had 15 or 20 people

1589
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:32,059
out there digging the root balls of

1590
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,530
their hemp crop out and I was and piling

1591
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:34,500
it in a big pile and burning it and I

1592
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:37,769
was just like

1593
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:40,139
Oh what are you doing not only are you

1594
01:06:37,769 --> 01:06:41,940
wasting man-hours and labor you're

1595
01:06:40,139 --> 01:06:44,789
wasting a valuable resource and you're

1596
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:48,030
depleting your soil use their just it

1597
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:50,969
pains me and if and if it was medical

1598
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:53,460
grade hemp instead of fiber hemp there's

1599
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:55,469
actually really valuable medicinal

1600
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:56,840
properties in those root balls as well

1601
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:59,539
what a waste

1602
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:02,550
absolutely yeah it's really a shame

1603
01:06:59,539 --> 01:07:04,590
unfortunately there's just still a lot

1604
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:07,470
of funky cultivation practices going

1605
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:09,780
around yeah yeah for sure so so I

1606
01:07:07,469 --> 01:07:12,769
haven't done enough volume to have an

1607
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:16,470
informed opinion on this with or

1608
01:07:12,769 --> 01:07:20,550
experience when you plant next to the

1609
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:23,039
old root ball will that root ball break

1610
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:26,700
down and nutrients cycle back into the

1611
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:30,300
soil within one cycle or will it be

1612
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:32,279
there for a couple cycles now the the

1613
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:34,500
delicate parts of the root ball will go

1614
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,990
away pretty quick as you can imagine so

1615
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:39,030
like the finer roots and whatnot those

1616
01:07:36,989 --> 01:07:40,889
tend to go really fast and I would say

1617
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:46,170
that those are gone from after the first

1618
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:48,449
cycle and and I've never done I've never

1619
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:50,340
sliced into my soil to look I mean would

1620
01:07:48,449 --> 01:07:54,059
be really interesting to kind of see but

1621
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:56,490
all I can judge is by what the the stem

1622
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:59,239
and stocky material that's above the

1623
01:07:56,489 --> 01:08:03,149
soil line that I've left after clipping

1624
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:05,969
its it sticks around and is visible for

1625
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:07,710
about six months but if you went in and

1626
01:08:05,969 --> 01:08:09,779
touched it it would be spongy and you

1627
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:12,480
could break it apart really super easy

1628
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:15,840
so my guess is that the stuff that's

1629
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,729
below the soil is long gone after your

1630
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,460
second cycle after the second cycle

1631
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:23,459
post-harvest if the stuff that's above

1632
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:25,079
that has access to air that tends to

1633
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,960
stay around a little more but if you

1634
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:28,890
touched it or it was stepped on or

1635
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,838
anything like that it would just be

1636
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:32,130
nothing it would it would break apart to

1637
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:35,489
nothing right on right on

1638
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:38,069
so um mm-hmm in preparation for a fur

1639
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:39,869
chatting with you you know I spent a lot

1640
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:44,120
of time on your YouTube channel which is

1641
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:47,408
really easy to do and one of the videos

1642
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:51,038
informs this next question you know raw

1643
01:08:47,408 --> 01:08:54,879
inputs like kelp and crab meal cannot be

1644
01:08:51,038 --> 01:08:56,139
eaten directly by the plant and so one

1645
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,338
of two things either has to happen

1646
01:08:56,139 --> 01:09:03,368
either you have to purchase a

1647
01:08:59,338 --> 01:09:08,168
predigested you know nutrient in a

1648
01:09:03,368 --> 01:09:11,009
bottle or you have to introduce the

1649
01:09:08,168 --> 01:09:14,979
whole kelp or crab meal or whatever and

1650
01:09:11,009 --> 01:09:17,618
give the microbes time to digest it

1651
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:20,739
which will then be picked up by the

1652
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:23,618
cannabis plant what are your views on

1653
01:09:20,738 --> 01:09:27,818
this which do you prefer and why well I

1654
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:29,768
mean I I clearly prefer the kind of the

1655
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:33,400
amending I don't like the plant ready

1656
01:09:29,769 --> 01:09:36,609
soluble bottle nutrients simply because

1657
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:38,588
you're not allowing the plant to

1658
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:40,630
regulate its own uptake at that point so

1659
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:42,729
when you have it when you have a soluble

1660
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:44,529
plant ready nutrient it's the plants

1661
01:09:42,729 --> 01:09:47,650
just gonna take it up because it's it's

1662
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:51,429
designed to be absorbed readily by the

1663
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:53,408
plant and and it typically my my very

1664
01:09:51,429 --> 01:09:56,498
rudimentary understanding is that is

1665
01:09:53,408 --> 01:09:58,029
that the root exudates play less of a

1666
01:09:56,498 --> 01:10:00,998
part when you're dealing with those kind

1667
01:09:58,029 --> 01:10:02,859
of water-soluble synthetics or even like

1668
01:10:00,998 --> 01:10:06,099
a water soluble organic nutrient that's

1669
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:08,198
just plant ready this this came up

1670
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:10,679
because people there there was a

1671
01:10:08,198 --> 01:10:15,069
question in the community of whether

1672
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:18,969
no-till beds need to be flushed and so

1673
01:10:15,069 --> 01:10:21,188
so this came about a basically from that

1674
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:23,229
there's that there's a group of folks

1675
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:25,659
who think that all plants need to be

1676
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:28,900
flushed in that because if you check the

1677
01:10:25,658 --> 01:10:31,779
runoff of a no-till bed it's got 3 or

1678
01:10:28,899 --> 01:10:34,138
400 parts per million that that that

1679
01:10:31,779 --> 01:10:37,029
means that it's you know your plants

1680
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:39,819
aren't flushed properly and I think that

1681
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:42,238
that's where that kind of video came

1682
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:47,498
from was me kind of addressing that

1683
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:50,168
aspect that you know a rock help is a

1684
01:10:47,498 --> 01:10:53,260
lot is a lot different in the soil than

1685
01:10:50,168 --> 01:10:55,898
a water soluble plant ready nutrient and

1686
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:59,110
so I definitely am on the side of the

1687
01:10:55,899 --> 01:11:00,710
fence that raw nutrients and minerals

1688
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:04,460
that you you

1689
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:06,469
Wow the soil biology to process and have

1690
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,449
their exchange with the plant you're

1691
01:11:06,469 --> 01:11:10,850
gonna you're gonna get a your maximum

1692
01:11:08,449 --> 01:11:14,420
genetic expression your maximum terpene

1693
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:17,989
expression and that's just based based

1694
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:21,590
on my experience I cultivated for 15 16

1695
01:11:17,988 --> 01:11:23,359
years with synthetic nutrients and

1696
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:26,090
organic bottled nutrients and plant

1697
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:28,549
ready nutrients and the second I

1698
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:31,670
switched to living soil there was a

1699
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:35,449
marked improvement the quality of the

1700
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:37,130
product was outrageously good and and

1701
01:11:35,449 --> 01:11:39,979
and it was now I was never turning back

1702
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:42,260
it makes a really good case to for not

1703
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:44,869
swapping out your soil every cycle -

1704
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:46,550
right I mean oh my gosh you know you

1705
01:11:44,869 --> 01:11:49,670
know in the older days it was like oh we

1706
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:52,940
want fresh soil and and nowadays that

1707
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:55,219
seems so foolhardy because we spent all

1708
01:11:52,939 --> 01:11:56,689
this time and effort building this

1709
01:11:55,219 --> 01:11:58,399
rhizosphere and all these healthy

1710
01:11:56,689 --> 01:12:00,829
microbes into mycelium and everything

1711
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:03,619
and and then you throw it out and you're

1712
01:12:00,829 --> 01:12:07,010
like ah you know it but nowadays you you

1713
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:11,000
you know with living soil you not only

1714
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:13,909
are giving your microbes say for example

1715
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,189
kelp but they may not process it all

1716
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:18,500
during this cycle and so you might get

1717
01:12:16,189 --> 01:12:21,939
some advantages from that kelp next

1718
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:23,899
cycle because you kept the same soil

1719
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:25,609
absolutely absolutely and that's the

1720
01:12:23,899 --> 01:12:27,710
other that's the other benefit of this

1721
01:12:25,609 --> 01:12:31,460
kind of this process is that you're

1722
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:34,730
allowing the plant and and in one of my

1723
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:37,340
youtube videos the no-till tox series

1724
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:39,289
that I kind of did that which was based

1725
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:42,469
on a lot of people just asking me to

1726
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:45,140
explain my minimalist kind of water only

1727
01:12:42,469 --> 01:12:48,680
approach and so I'd like to think of

1728
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:51,710
that interaction between the soil and

1729
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:53,900
plant is this sacred union and so when

1730
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:57,770
the plant is interacting with a healthy

1731
01:12:53,899 --> 01:12:59,988
microbiome in the soil it's asking it's

1732
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:01,760
calling for only the stuff that it needs

1733
01:12:59,988 --> 01:13:03,559
and nothing more and that's that goes

1734
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,510
back to that why we don't have to flush

1735
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,760
is because it's not over feeding itself

1736
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:11,289
the plant doesn't have a capacity to

1737
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:14,840
over feed itself it's a it's a highly

1738
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:17,658
finely tuned mechanism in itself

1739
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,760
allows it to only ask for what it needs

1740
01:13:17,658 --> 01:13:22,759
and only receive that so there's never

1741
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:25,090
like an over it doesn't over feed itself

1742
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,400
nitrogen ever so when you allow that

1743
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:31,219
natural kind of process that was

1744
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:33,408
designed in the plant that it evolved in

1745
01:13:31,219 --> 01:13:35,270
the plant and you're not bypassing that

1746
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:37,039
I think that's the one of the

1747
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:40,760
contributing factors to getting plants

1748
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:42,319
that so clearly are exhibiting maximum

1749
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,539
genetic expression you know their

1750
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,420
genetic potential is fully expressed

1751
01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:49,158
because you're allowing those little

1752
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:51,380
those little micro mechanisms in the

1753
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:53,710
plants to play itself out I mean they're

1754
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:56,599
there for a reason when you put it

1755
01:13:53,710 --> 01:14:00,618
elegantly like that it really points out

1756
01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:04,279
how you know the soil has an

1757
01:14:00,618 --> 01:14:09,079
intelligence and a heart and and a

1758
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:11,479
strategy for itself and and and mostly

1759
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:14,868
so long as we can set up the soil to

1760
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:17,089
succeed it will do its work absolutely

1761
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:21,170
yeah so kind of changing gears a little

1762
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:23,840
bit I've seen from the fantastic

1763
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:26,868
freshwater farms Instagram which

1764
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,039
unfortunately was deactivated but but

1765
01:14:26,868 --> 01:14:29,598
we've got a new and we'll give you the

1766
01:14:28,039 --> 01:14:32,300
address for in a little bit but

1767
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:35,060
freshwater farms uses LED lights what's

1768
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:37,400
your experience been using LED oh boy

1769
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,000
I'll tell you what I was a really hard

1770
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:42,198
sell

1771
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:46,789
I've been an HID cultivator from the

1772
01:14:42,198 --> 01:14:49,488
beginning so over 20 years and I just

1773
01:14:46,789 --> 01:14:51,500
had never had any personal experience I

1774
01:14:49,488 --> 01:14:54,649
hadn't seen any flowers grown with LED

1775
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:56,719
and having been a former owner of two

1776
01:14:54,649 --> 01:15:00,348
brick-and-mortar kind of indoor grow

1777
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:03,079
shops I am intimately aware of the vast

1778
01:15:00,349 --> 01:15:08,029
quantity of snake oil that permeates the

1779
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:10,010
industry and this kind of no Rd products

1780
01:15:08,029 --> 01:15:11,329
that hit the market where the consumers

1781
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:13,310
end up becoming the research and

1782
01:15:11,329 --> 01:15:16,429
development size I was really really

1783
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:18,980
weary of stepping into this realm and

1784
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:21,819
looking towards other large scale

1785
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:25,098
cultivators that just simply never

1786
01:15:21,819 --> 01:15:26,929
having even to this to this date haven't

1787
01:15:25,099 --> 01:15:28,550
made the transition because they're

1788
01:15:26,929 --> 01:15:30,408
skeptical and weary

1789
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:34,239
of the technology and that whether it

1790
01:15:30,408 --> 01:15:36,799
had arrived or not so I was extremely

1791
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:40,158
extremely trepidatious moving forward I

1792
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,570
had I looked to grow mouse I don't know

1793
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:45,948
if you're familiar with him he's kind of

1794
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:49,158
a really popular DIY LED guy who's

1795
01:15:45,948 --> 01:15:52,308
working with killed Ellie D now and he's

1796
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:55,308
I really value his value his opinion and

1797
01:15:52,309 --> 01:15:58,639
so I reached out to him when I connected

1798
01:15:55,309 --> 01:16:00,559
with Mike at freshwater farms you know

1799
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:02,118
when he was like we were discussing how

1800
01:16:00,559 --> 01:16:07,909
we wanted to go about setting up his

1801
01:16:02,118 --> 01:16:10,069
facility and long story short he put me

1802
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:12,319
in contact with the current light

1803
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:15,319
company that we use now lighting company

1804
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:19,578
for LED and it took about six months of

1805
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:21,738
talks and visiting places that were

1806
01:16:19,578 --> 01:16:23,750
using them and and just getting

1807
01:16:21,738 --> 01:16:27,888
assurances from folks that I knew were

1808
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:30,948
using similar technology and getting the

1809
01:16:27,889 --> 01:16:32,989
results they were getting you know it it

1810
01:16:30,948 --> 01:16:35,779
was enough for me to move forward and

1811
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:38,629
try it out so that being said we're

1812
01:16:35,779 --> 01:16:40,609
really impressed with LED tech I think

1813
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:43,400
it's arrived you know we're getting to

1814
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:45,019
the point where we have lights where you

1815
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:46,729
have independent spectra tuning

1816
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:49,300
abilities you're allowed to tune your

1817
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:52,250
Reds your yellows and your blue whites

1818
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:55,340
independently so you can actually affect

1819
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:59,210
this how your plant grows the nodal

1820
01:16:55,340 --> 01:17:00,559
spacing the lateral growth all those

1821
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:02,118
types of things so there's a there's a

1822
01:17:00,559 --> 01:17:03,920
bit of a learning curve for folks like

1823
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:07,279
me who's just used to hanging you know

1824
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:09,889
HIV really high and letting it fly

1825
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:11,779
so there's if there was a bit of a

1826
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:15,949
learning curve on my part but I really

1827
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:20,029
think that you know the the the the

1828
01:17:15,948 --> 01:17:25,460
chance for LEDs to kind of overtake the

1829
01:17:20,029 --> 01:17:28,639
HID lights in the industry it's not if

1830
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:31,039
it's when it's happening like where

1831
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:34,219
we're seeing we're seeing yields you

1832
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:36,229
know that are you know three pounds two

1833
01:17:34,219 --> 01:17:38,779
and a half to three pounds per 700 watts

1834
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:40,669
of LED fixture you know which is

1835
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,500
privileged is pretty impressive and and

1836
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:43,449
then it's

1837
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:45,550
sacrificing terpenes we're not

1838
01:17:43,449 --> 01:17:50,289
sacrificing any of those things i think

1839
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:53,650
i think as we refine our abilities with

1840
01:17:50,289 --> 01:17:55,510
the lights will start to that they'll

1841
01:17:53,649 --> 01:17:58,149
start to be a greater appreciation of

1842
01:17:55,510 --> 01:18:00,010
what the leds can do there's got to be

1843
01:17:58,149 --> 01:18:04,000
some people out there who are begging

1844
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:05,800
that you name drop the the kind of light

1845
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,720
that you decided to use so do you do you

1846
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,289
want to plug your lighting fellow yeah

1847
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:11,530
absolutely

1848
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:14,619
we're going with the protec evey seven

1849
01:18:11,529 --> 01:18:18,819
hundredths they're a really great

1850
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:20,199
company and the light that they have the

1851
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,579
fixture that they have in all of our

1852
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:22,899
research we went around and i'm not

1853
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:27,369
going to name the ones that we didn't

1854
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:30,849
like but we saw and talked to many many

1855
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:33,430
LED lighting manufacturers and they all

1856
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:37,570
seemed so cheap and they seemed so

1857
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:40,600
flimsy and this this unit from prokhor

1858
01:18:37,569 --> 01:18:43,479
tech is really durable sturdy it's

1859
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,820
completely waterproof if there's a lot

1860
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:47,439
of a lot of benefits to this fixtures I

1861
01:18:45,819 --> 01:18:50,049
highly recommend people check them out

1862
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:51,849
all right fantastic so you know before

1863
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:54,489
we wrap up Joshua I want to I want to

1864
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:57,579
give you a nice big open question kind

1865
01:18:54,489 --> 01:19:01,840
of a fishing expedition you know I have

1866
01:18:57,579 --> 01:19:03,939
folks with a depth of experience like

1867
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:07,390
you on the show and and sometimes you

1868
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:10,210
know I can put together a question path

1869
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:13,360
like I did for today but but I'm really

1870
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:16,750
curious what what did I not ask you what

1871
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:19,689
what what do you know that you are

1872
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:22,420
excited about that people in the scene

1873
01:19:19,689 --> 01:19:25,149
just aren't talking about yet and I'm

1874
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:27,250
not experienced enough to ask you so so

1875
01:19:25,149 --> 01:19:29,109
I just want to like you know open it up

1876
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:30,670
for you to say what are you excited

1877
01:19:29,109 --> 01:19:33,639
about that we should know about that you

1878
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:35,440
want to break down for us sure sure well

1879
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,640
I think that I don't think there's

1880
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:39,099
anything really that you haven't touched

1881
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,410
on but I do think that what I'm

1882
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:44,700
personally have been excited about over

1883
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:49,899
the past six months or so is diving into

1884
01:19:44,699 --> 01:19:51,340
biodynamic cultivation practices and in

1885
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:55,329
looking into that I don't it's almost

1886
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:57,610
like thinking of your sort of thing

1887
01:19:55,329 --> 01:20:00,779
of handling your soils in a homeopathic

1888
01:19:57,609 --> 01:20:04,899
fashion so really very thick very small

1889
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:07,119
powerful kind of head sounds starry-eyed

1890
01:20:04,899 --> 01:20:09,759
again it's kind of like you dealing with

1891
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:11,890
energy almost more like so there's

1892
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:15,400
things like a horn manure and horn

1893
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:18,610
silica where they take manure and cow

1894
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:20,439
manure and pack it into cow's horn and

1895
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:22,989
it's specifically a cow's horn they've

1896
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:25,750
tried to use other horns like goat and

1897
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:27,760
and ibex and it just doesn't have the

1898
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:30,390
same effect that they'll bury it for the

1899
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,500
winter and then what happens is this

1900
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:34,390
transmutation takes place and you're

1901
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,579
left in the springtime when you dig

1902
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:40,840
these things up you're left with this

1903
01:20:36,579 --> 01:20:43,269
ball of rubbery humic material that's

1904
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:46,989
pleasant to smell it doesn't smell like

1905
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:49,300
manure it's and it's a highly valuable

1906
01:20:46,989 --> 01:20:53,019
resource for your soil for your soil

1907
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:56,079
microbiology and you can use super small

1908
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:59,620
quantities of this to refight revitalize

1909
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:01,479
a very large amount of area and and so

1910
01:20:59,619 --> 01:21:04,149
that there's this horn manure there's

1911
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:06,819
horn silica where they'll take quartz

1912
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:10,199
crystal grind it up put it into the horn

1913
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:13,569
cow horn bury it in the summertime and

1914
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:16,359
then dig it out and then use it as a

1915
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:18,909
foliar application to help maximize like

1916
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:21,429
if you have a in a cloudy day and you

1917
01:21:18,909 --> 01:21:23,409
don't have don't have very much light

1918
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:25,810
it'll help maximize the light that you

1919
01:21:23,409 --> 01:21:28,659
do have and there's a lot of really good

1920
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:30,340
research validating a lot of these

1921
01:21:28,659 --> 01:21:32,800
things and that's just a couple of the

1922
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:34,329
inputs the biodynamic inputs there's a

1923
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,590
lot of them and some of them are pretty

1924
01:21:34,329 --> 01:21:40,960
strange when you get down into it but

1925
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:42,430
the science behind it is really really

1926
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,939
interesting and there's a lot of people

1927
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:48,550
like wine producers that are switching

1928
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:50,199
to this biodynamic cultivation because

1929
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:53,710
they've noticed the difference in their

1930
01:21:50,199 --> 01:21:56,979
in their grapes that there are more wild

1931
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:59,829
tasting and the more rich and the flavor

1932
01:21:56,979 --> 01:22:01,689
profile is is very high so I would like

1933
01:21:59,829 --> 01:22:05,500
to kind of take this into the cannabis

1934
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:08,169
realm you know when the first part

1935
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,159
putting the compost in the horn and

1936
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:11,350
burying it

1937
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:14,319
I'm like all right that sounds different

1938
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:16,510
and unique but but I can see how there

1939
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:18,519
could be some subtle science that we

1940
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:20,579
haven't learned yet there but then your

1941
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,900
second example you're like you know

1942
01:22:20,579 --> 01:22:26,109
grinding crystals and I could almost

1943
01:22:22,899 --> 01:22:29,229
hear like everybody in the audience kind

1944
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:34,960
of together roll our eyes yeah but at

1945
01:22:29,229 --> 01:22:37,179
the same time you know I'm not so cocky

1946
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,460
or full of myself that I think that I

1947
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:44,010
know all the ways that the world works

1948
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:47,529
right and so if if people are getting

1949
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:51,579
you know qualitative if not quantitative

1950
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:56,229
positive results and lots of science

1951
01:22:51,579 --> 01:22:57,159
supports the energetics of crystals well

1952
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:58,629
alright

1953
01:22:57,159 --> 01:23:00,460
there's a whole lot of things that

1954
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:03,340
science hasn't unearthed yet and maybe

1955
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:07,060
there's something to that but but holy

1956
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:09,220
smokes right tell me about it I most

1957
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:11,050
hesitant to talk about it for that very

1958
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:13,300
reason because it may mediately put you

1959
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:15,670
in this class of like starry-eyed hippy

1960
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:18,310
just kind of like you know oh that guy's

1961
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:20,170
really like you know he's on one or

1962
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:24,400
something but when you look into it

1963
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:27,460
Steiner the guy who developed this was

1964
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:29,559
was knows was no hacky he really was a

1965
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:32,890
really intelligent man who's very gifted

1966
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:35,560
and when you start looking into some of

1967
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:37,960
this biodynamic stuff and you can get

1968
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:39,130
past that kind of weird feeling is like

1969
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:42,069
we were talking about earlier with the

1970
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:44,770
soil like what what looks like magic to

1971
01:23:42,069 --> 01:23:47,409
us there's science behind it we just

1972
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,910
haven't found it yet and so I think

1973
01:23:47,409 --> 01:23:50,859
that's what we're dealing with when

1974
01:23:48,909 --> 01:23:53,529
we're talking about bio dynamics now I'm

1975
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:55,089
no expert I'm just now starting to kind

1976
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:58,449
of wet my whistle

1977
01:23:55,090 --> 01:24:00,789
in that regard but it's wildly and

1978
01:23:58,449 --> 01:24:04,029
insanely fascinating to me and you're

1979
01:24:00,789 --> 01:24:07,300
clearly a soil adventurer right you know

1980
01:24:04,029 --> 01:24:09,639
so so this is this is novel and kind of

1981
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:11,199
weird and potentially works that sounds

1982
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:14,070
like a recipe that like will totally

1983
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:17,319
attract you personally as a cultivator

1984
01:24:14,069 --> 01:24:19,779
absolutely so the only thing that I had

1985
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:22,090
ever heard about biodynamic really up

1986
01:24:19,779 --> 01:24:23,319
till today I mean I see biodynamic on

1987
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:25,449
bottles of wine

1988
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:28,328
for sure but but you know you'll get

1989
01:24:25,448 --> 01:24:30,819
people arguing back and forth on forums

1990
01:24:28,328 --> 01:24:33,488
like the probiotic farmers Alliance on

1991
01:24:30,819 --> 01:24:35,799
Facebook and and and people will talk

1992
01:24:33,488 --> 01:24:37,809
about either popping their seeds or

1993
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,849
harvesting with different moon cycles

1994
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:41,739
and stuff like that and and I don't I

1995
01:24:39,849 --> 01:24:43,480
don't personally have an opinion one way

1996
01:24:41,738 --> 01:24:45,609
or another because I don't know enough

1997
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:47,799
to have an informed opinion but is that

1998
01:24:45,609 --> 01:24:49,479
part of your bigger picture with

1999
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,869
attraction to by net bio dynamics are

2000
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:55,238
you are you popping seeds with the moon

2001
01:24:51,868 --> 01:24:57,158
not not just yet I haven't drank the

2002
01:24:55,238 --> 01:25:02,289
kool-aid that much I mean I think I

2003
01:24:57,158 --> 01:25:05,219
think that look the moon clearly has an

2004
01:25:02,289 --> 01:25:09,340
effect on bodies of water on the planet

2005
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:12,099
and so the when you think about how it

2006
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:14,739
affects the tides you know and you think

2007
01:25:12,099 --> 01:25:17,710
that we are a very large percentage

2008
01:25:14,738 --> 01:25:19,779
water the plants have a large percentage

2009
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:21,760
of water in them it would stand to

2010
01:25:19,779 --> 01:25:24,429
reason that if the moon is affecting

2011
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,969
large bodies of water like the ocean

2012
01:25:24,429 --> 01:25:30,368
with tides that there's some kind of

2013
01:25:26,969 --> 01:25:35,529
effect on anything that is water based

2014
01:25:30,368 --> 01:25:37,479
on on this globe so you know I can get

2015
01:25:35,529 --> 01:25:38,979
with it I can I can I can see where

2016
01:25:37,479 --> 01:25:41,259
they're going with it I just haven't

2017
01:25:38,979 --> 01:25:43,718
gone that far down the rabbit hole I

2018
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:45,969
think you can incorporate some of the

2019
01:25:43,719 --> 01:25:48,429
biodynamic principles without having to

2020
01:25:45,969 --> 01:25:51,219
go that far into it in planting and

2021
01:25:48,429 --> 01:25:53,590
harvesting according to you know

2022
01:25:51,219 --> 01:25:57,639
astrological signs and whatnot

2023
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:59,469
but once again who are we to kind of say

2024
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:02,170
that there's nothing there you know we

2025
01:25:59,469 --> 01:26:03,279
just we simply just don't know we can

2026
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:04,359
just shrug our shoulders and be like

2027
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:06,250
yeah that sounds crazy

2028
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:09,279
but until we actually practically apply

2029
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:10,960
it if there's we can't really formulate

2030
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:13,719
that opinion what we do know is that

2031
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:16,539
there's lots of people who do utilize

2032
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:18,368
this lots of commercial farms operate

2033
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:21,060
under these biodynamic principles and

2034
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:24,908
they crush it they're they're their

2035
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:26,860
vegetables and fruits are routinely more

2036
01:26:24,908 --> 01:26:29,769
nutrient and mineral dense than

2037
01:26:26,859 --> 01:26:32,109
conventional even organic practices so

2038
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:35,560
there's something there's some something

2039
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:38,559
that that's there that deserves a

2040
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,970
right that's awesome I'm so glad that

2041
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,620
you were willing to go there with me

2042
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:44,590
Joshua that was that was a really

2043
01:26:41,619 --> 01:26:47,619
interesting section so so before we sign

2044
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:50,409
off I want to give you props because it

2045
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:53,140
just came out this week that we're

2046
01:26:50,409 --> 01:26:55,930
recording this the week before Emerald

2047
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:57,520
cup and one of your photographs was

2048
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:58,690
while it did not win it you've got

2049
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,660
information that you were a finalist

2050
01:26:58,689 --> 01:27:03,549
right well I placed in the top 30 so

2051
01:27:01,659 --> 01:27:05,349
it's really kind of a funny thing I saw

2052
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:06,880
that they were doing the photo contest

2053
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:08,710
and I was like oh man I just

2054
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,760
I'll just throw something in and see oh

2055
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:11,649
so I really didn't give it much thought

2056
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,869
I just picked a photo that I really

2057
01:27:11,649 --> 01:27:15,219
thought was was great and sent it in

2058
01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:16,899
with no expectation of any

2059
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:18,310
acknowledgment whatsoever and they got

2060
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:21,729
back and said that I was in the top 30

2061
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:24,880
out of a couple hundred entries so I was

2062
01:27:21,729 --> 01:27:27,219
I was impressed I felt I felt humbled

2063
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,859
yeah well hey it's it's nice to get

2064
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:32,560
those kind of unexpected kudos man so so

2065
01:27:29,859 --> 01:27:34,359
congratulations on that so so Joshua

2066
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,470
thanks so much for being on the show

2067
01:27:34,359 --> 01:27:36,909
not only do you have a wealth of

2068
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:39,430
experience but you're just totally a

2069
01:27:36,909 --> 01:27:41,349
delightful dude so so thanks for coming

2070
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:43,539
on and I look forward to talking with

2071
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:45,789
you again I really appreciate it thank

2072
01:27:43,539 --> 01:27:48,670
you so much for having me on right on so

2073
01:27:45,789 --> 01:27:51,189
so if any of you want to get in contact

2074
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:54,609
with Joshua or just follow along his

2075
01:27:51,189 --> 01:27:58,599
totally awesome Instagram you can get

2076
01:27:54,609 --> 01:28:00,819
that at Joshua Stein's land all one word

2077
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:07,450
and Joshua is pretty easy but Steen's

2078
01:28:00,819 --> 01:28:07,869
'ln is st e e NS la ND Joshua's teens

2079
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:10,199
Lindh

2080
01:28:07,869 --> 01:28:18,489
all one word and then also even though

2081
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:20,439
his farms his farms IG got removed they

2082
01:28:18,489 --> 01:28:22,179
are reset up but they aren't there it's

2083
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:24,309
only like 15 or 20 photos there

2084
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:25,470
somewhere so far but you're gonna want

2085
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:29,080
to follow that anyway and that's

2086
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:31,060
freshwater farms and then to underscores

2087
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:33,250
so freshwater farms and then with two

2088
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:35,410
underscores and and you don't want to

2089
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:38,310
miss that and then finally you

2090
01:28:35,409 --> 01:28:42,250
definitely want to subscribe to Joshua's

2091
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:44,410
fabulous YouTube channel where he

2092
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:47,050
records a lot of live stuff he answers

2093
01:28:44,409 --> 01:28:48,340
questions he does how to's in his garden

2094
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:50,860
at home

2095
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:53,920
