1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,949
so hey Colin thanks again for getting

2
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:10,000
together with me here for a second so so

3
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:12,579
first of all thank you for sponsoring

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,288
the shaping fire podcast we love your

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,198
support yes and we love telling people

6
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:19,480
about mammoths pee and you know since

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,100
your commercials run on the shaping

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,080
fighter podcast a lot of people come up

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,460
to me and ask me about the product you

10
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,899
know I can say you know I use the

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,330
product and I like the product and what

12
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:30,038
it does for me but there are like like

13
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:32,679
four questions and people are always

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,679
asking me that I know I'm giving them

15
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:38,018
sub optimum answers because it's not my

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,819
product right so I'd love to go through

17
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:42,248
those questions with you and just have

18
00:00:39,819 --> 00:00:43,659
you answer them the proper way and then

19
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:45,309
and then when people ask me I can just

20
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:46,960
send them for this video right perfect

21
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:48,459
all right so before we get into those

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,889
four questions for anybody who's not

23
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,408
familiar with the mammoth P product from

24
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:55,359
mammoth microbes we just explain what it

25
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:57,069
does yeah absolutely so my name is Colin

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,120
bellum the co-founder of mammoth

27
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:01,109
microbes and the inventor of the

28
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:03,849
technology mammoth P is a liquid organic

29
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,920
microbial additive that acts as a

30
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,228
catalyst to maximize plant phosphorus

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,240
uptake that allows plants to take up as

32
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:12,340
much phosphorus naturally as a plant

33
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,589
possibly can which allows the plants to

34
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,079
maximize its health development quality

35
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,540
and yield and that's what we see when

36
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,969
growers apply mammoth pee as an additive

37
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,670
in their fertigation or nutrient regime

38
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:26,650
that the plants will maximize their

39
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,409
phenotypic potential maximizing their

40
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,780
quality and increase the yield as much

41
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,609
as that plant can do we typically see an

42
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,760
average of around 60 percent increase

43
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:38,349
yield with Mimas P additions so is the

44
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,460
idea but what's actually in the bottle

45
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:46,059
is a collection of microbes living

46
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:48,250
microbes and and they are helping change

47
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,590
the form of the phosphorus so it's more

48
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,780
readily obtainable by the plant that's

49
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,950
the idea that's exactly right

50
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,170
transforming foster some unavailable

51
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,269
forms of bioavailable

52
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,960
that's a microbial function and that's

53
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,549
why we selected the microbes an active

54
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,439
consortium of microbes it's in mammoth

55
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,140
pH just a concentrated bottle of

56
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,538
microbes but these microbes function to

57
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,340
facilitate phosphorus liberation to

58
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,229
maximize availability for a plain empty

59
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,670
phosphorus liberation I like that right

60
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,590
on all right so here are the four

61
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,329
questions that I get all the time so the

62
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,430
first one since it is a living product

63
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,650
and you know you know probiotic growers

64
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,989
are always trying to you know ferment

65
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,510
things or make compost teas people ask

66
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:30,900
me can they can they just buy one bottle

67
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:33,389
of mammoth pee and then just take little

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,430
bits of it and and incubate it to make

69
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:37,109
it more right - by adding a little bit

70
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,150
of molasses or something - admit to make

71
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,070
it grow and then never have to buy the

72
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,680
product again is it is it possible to do

73
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,599
that so conceptually yes these are

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,980
active microbes that they are viable and

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,469
they will grow in different substrates

76
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,449
the challenge is maintaining the

77
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,759
integrity of the community structure I

78
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:56,369
think what happens as weari propagate

79
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,500
communities of microbes over time that

80
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,030
there's going to be drift in the

81
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,009
relative abundances of the different

82
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,229
microbes and that relative abundances is

83
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:07,500
really important we did a lot of studies

84
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:09,929
to show that the microbes in mammoth pee

85
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,610
in those relative abundances do

86
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,069
facilitate much higher phosphorous

87
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,049
cycling then the isolates the

88
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,949
individuals or different combinations of

89
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,959
the species they're in so you I would I

90
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,609
think that you're gonna compromise the

91
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,680
quality of the product over time by

92
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,360
doing that I do recommend plugging it in

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,340
it's that's what's one of the reasons we

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,190
made it so concentrated so it is

95
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,530
scalable it's 0.6 mils per gallon and so

96
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:37,889
the product does last I'll go a long way

97
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,930
and you can play with it and I'm all

98
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,359
about experimenting but just know that

99
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,340
we have experimented internally and over

100
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,079
time we do see drift and that's why we

101
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,239
recommend going back to the main source

102
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,400
you might even carry it out one

103
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,680
generation but then it'd be nice to

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,870
start from the from the original source

105
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,030
of the bottle that you purchased had to

106
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,969
continue you know just maximizing

107
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,469
confidence so when you say drift if I'm

108
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:03,598
interpretating you're interpreting

109
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:05,489
alright what you're saying is that okay

110
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,419
so when you got the bottle you've got a

111
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,490
particular rate

112
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,530
she loved microbes but when you go to

113
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,890
try to incubate it yourself those

114
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,539
microbes are opportunists so if it's

115
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,608
warmer colder or there's more air or

116
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,469
less air it's going to choose different

117
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:21,180
microbes to favor and then it's going to

118
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,639
get out of balance of what it's supposed

119
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,069
to be and all of your testing of why

120
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,040
mammoths pee works is because of the of

121
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:31,079
the microbe mix that's in the bottle and

122
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,939
so when you go and you try to redo it

123
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,889
yourself you might get drifting

124
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,980
percentages so it's not really the

125
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:40,139
actual product anymore yeah yes there's

126
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,819
confidence and knowing that you have

127
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,400
something very consistent in the mammoth

128
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,459
pee bottle if we start to work on trying

129
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,959
to scale the microbes up just inherently

130
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,699
if you don't have a completely sterile

131
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,049
room which we have pretty much in our in

132
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,399
our facilities when we're scaling the

133
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,079
bottles up when we wash the balls and do

134
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,429
everything you're gonna get a lot of

135
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,039
issues environmental fluctuations

136
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,870
seasonal environmental fluctuation you

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,490
have contaminants coming in Cecily and

138
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,168
so it's really hard to think with

139
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,180
confidence that you can continue to reap

140
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:07,889
rocket mammoths and keep it pristine

141
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,579
right I would be hard to do right on

142
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:13,288
that makes sense so um you know so I'm

143
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,089
gonna bring up this question but I

144
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:17,399
understand that it's pretty farcical but

145
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:20,310
but people will often mention on threads

146
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,750
that there are there are microbes in the

147
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,850
product that are dangerous to humans

148
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,439
right and so some people say I won't buy

149
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,390
it because it's gotten you know this or

150
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,978
you know another microbe and odd thing

151
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,439
is is like people will choose different

152
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:34,139
microbes yeah so so you know is the

153
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,649
product in any way you know dangerous to

154
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,990
humans even if used incorrectly no I

155
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:41,609
mean you don't want to ingest any

156
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,410
fertilizer you don't want to ingest any

157
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,509
life microbial product it's not good for

158
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,490
you I've actually had some growers write

159
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:50,250
me and said hey long story short don't

160
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,680
ask I mean just as a manaphy and nothing

161
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,379
about happen don't try that at home is

162
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,449
not a good idea no matter what but you

163
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,100
know that's part of the rigor of the

164
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,288
regulation we have to register our

165
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,720
product every state with every country

166
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:05,459
we have a really sophisticated team of

167
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,919
actually world leaders of soil microbial

168
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,149
ecologists early on that we brought on

169
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,889
board to make sure that we were doing

170
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:12,509
everything the right way were scientists

171
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,769
and we want to bring value to growers

172
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:16,348
using microbes

173
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,209
Solutions every one of the microbes and

174
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:21,209
the strains that we have in mammoth pee

175
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:22,918
our BIOS bio level safety one which

176
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:24,870
means that you know there is the very

177
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,689
lowest chance of anything bad happening

178
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,939
and we haven't had any cases ever of

179
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,550
anything like that occurring you know we

180
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,288
do recommend using safety precautions

181
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,389
just like any fertilizer would on the

182
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:38,668
label it's just kind of a generic we've

183
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,478
have guys producing the product since

184
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:42,930
day one

185
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,878
you know it's just no different than

186
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,939
brewing a tea honestly the way you're

187
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,349
handling mammoth be the difference in

188
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,209
mammoth pee is are so functionally

189
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:54,060
targeted that the you're gonna use that

190
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:56,489
it's a specific clone or bloom stimulant

191
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,610
to maximize the availability of

192
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,949
phosphorous for plant uptake alright so

193
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,740
this last one this is the most common

194
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,780
question that I get from people and I

195
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,478
guess is kind of a two-part question

196
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:13,168
number one doesn't matter when it

197
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:15,348
changes colors and number two how do you

198
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:18,000
figure out what the expiration date is

199
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:21,509
both great questions so the expiration

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,848
date on the bottle we suggest using with

201
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:26,400
within one year after opening the

202
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:28,259
expiration date is on every single

203
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,718
bottle on the on the but back so you can

204
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,778
see that our shelf-life data now is

205
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:36,060
real-time data and it's out over 27

206
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:39,718
months and so the product is actually

207
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,728
viably good data supported over 27

208
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:43,528
months saying that we do still recommend

209
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:45,750
using it with one year after opening

210
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:47,699
because that that continues to once you

211
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,680
add that oxygen it's a different thing

212
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,449
well the microbial activity actually

213
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,240
increases when you open the bottle and

214
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,550
so it's amazing how long these microbes

215
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,259
lasts in this solution so I'm not

216
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,400
worried about that at all I do think

217
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,199
that you should follow recommended

218
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,810
applications if you can use it within

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,908
two years you're gonna be perfectly fine

220
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,879
and again just so there's no

221
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:09,870
misunderstanding we just gave guidelines

222
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,269
on the back of the bottle because

223
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,740
honestly every time we get more data we

224
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:15,658
can change all the labels or we just

225
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,889
wait till it goes out the first the

226
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:20,259
first shelf life or recomm

227
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,759
a use on the label was six months

228
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:23,770
because we had six months worth of data

229
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,150
so we put that on there then when we had

230
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:28,060
two years we actually changed it out a

231
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:29,799
little further so shelf life is not an

232
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,028
issue it lasts as long and longer than

233
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,560
any product I've seen on the market is

234
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:34,000
actually fascinating what does the

235
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,609
change in the color part change in the

236
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,708
color is oxidation that occurs sometimes

237
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,200
not always and it's very confusing we've

238
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:43,119
dialed in why it's a little harder to

239
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,410
control this is life in a bottle this is

240
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,078
nature in a bottle and there's some

241
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:49,719
variability what we do know is that the

242
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:52,120
guarantee analysis is at least is at

243
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,560
least the same between the lighter

244
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,240
bottles and the darker bottles what we

245
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,939
do know also is they're slightly higher

246
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,860
microbial activity and higher microbial

247
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,810
concentrations see a few counts in the

248
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,879
darker bottles which means that actually

249
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:05,588
the darker bottles are a little more

250
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,000
effective probably than the lighter

251
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:09,370
bottles when we have a lot of growers

252
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,659
that use mammoths and what they do is

253
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,860
they like to grab the darker bottles

254
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,778
because they know it's a little more

255
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,579
concentrated both of them are very

256
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:18,070
effective and work very well that

257
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:19,750
happens because as microbial activity

258
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,120
slightly increases sometimes it can

259
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,470
create a slight oxidation event which

260
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,620
actually colors some of the carbon

261
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,230
constituents in the bottle slight change

262
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:33,190
in color as a effect of slightly higher

263
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:35,528
activity I still our team still can't

264
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,029
figure out how to normalize that to keep

265
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:39,610
it consistent it's a little bit of a

266
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:41,439
mystery again it's really hard to

267
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,778
control every aspect of nature and we're

268
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,990
dealing with nature soil microbes that

269
00:09:43,778 --> 00:09:49,149
we're trying to package for farmers and

270
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,769
for growers and so it's a little bit of

271
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:53,409
a challenge we're still working on it I

272
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:56,139
hope to have a better answer soon but

273
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:58,719
what what I do say and I stand by is

274
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,759
that mammoth microbes work and maybe

275
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,860
even a little better with the darker

276
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,328
color cool well thanks for answering

277
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,649
those questions for me now I can just

278
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:07,778
like move everybody alone in this video

279
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:09,578
