60
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:30,019
stop 40 under 40 so please welcome our

61
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:32,569
panels so the speakers ask me they want

62
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:35,090
to make sure that they they design their

63
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:37,158
answers most appropriate for the room so

64
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,598
in me I'm gonna give you four categories

65
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,919
and if you see yourself in this category

66
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:41,479
raise your hand if you would if you

67
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,358
would so if you're a cultivator raise

68
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:47,138
your hand please all right and then if

69
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:49,579
you are a dispensary owner or employee

70
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:54,519
all right and then if you are a

71
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:56,480
manufacturer all right and then other

72
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,658
all right there you go so there's a

73
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,158
general idea guys so so so let's see so

74
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:02,628
first of all let's get right into it

75
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:05,060
for this question we're gonna start with

76
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:07,310
Colin on the far end and then Jacob and

77
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,469
John Paul can jump in so Colin

78
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,509
regenerative cannabis agriculture is

79
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,848
increasing in popularity and importance

80
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:16,188
and the range of ways to practice it in

81
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:18,289
commercial cultivation is pretty huge so

82
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:20,810
what is an example of a regenerative

83
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:23,628
practice that is easy to get into that

84
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,969
has real benefits within a year you can

85
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:27,500
hear me okay so thank you everyone for

86
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:28,969
being here I'm gonna keep it pretty

87
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,449
simple and they keep it with management

88
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:35,449
ease on the science side regenerate to

89
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:38,030
replace regenerative cells as biology we

90
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:41,540
replace ourselves we grow ourselves or

91
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,739
in farming it's about making sure and I

92
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:45,439
think about this in terms of

93
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,569
sustainability also we're giving more

94
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,859
than we take away that's what I think

95
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:50,899
about when I think about my generative

96
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:53,659
practices and as soon as I think about

97
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,260
regenerative agriculture I think about

98
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:59,298
carbon and carbon is the currency of all

99
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:02,030
life on Earth and it's definitely the

100
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:04,579
currency of soil health and the problem

101
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,250
that we have in agriculture in general

102
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:10,069
agriculture is that we're taking carbon

103
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,469
out of the system as we break it up as

104
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:14,388
we kill it as we farm it we're losing

105
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:18,220
soil organic matter of school organic

106
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:20,889
carbon and that holds everything

107
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,040
for soil fertility nutrient holding

108
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,719
capacity water looking capacity and so

109
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,069
to answer that question what I think

110
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,710
about what I think about regenerative

111
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:32,889
agriculture has one simple thing that

112
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:35,289
you can do is think about the carbon how

113
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,899
are you madam or carbon into your soil

114
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,910
it's your substrate then you are taking

115
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:42,579
away and you can do that through a lot

116
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,510
of different means there's biochar as an

117
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:47,889
example and I just want to preface that

118
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,959
it's about how you're getting it on the

119
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:53,050
back end to you know thinking about

120
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:56,109
where all your inputs are originating

121
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,509
from is a part of regeneration and so

122
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,610
it's a big picture but if you think

123
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:02,980
about it in terms of how you can

124
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,259
maintain your soil you can add as little

125
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,790
as possible you really have to start

126
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,069
with thinking about the carbon in that

127
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,120
soil and that's a pretty big topic but

128
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:12,639
that's where I'm going to leave it right

129
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,530
now that's great Jacob same thing to you

130
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,060
so what's an example regenerative

131
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:19,059
practice that's easy to get into nest

132
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,970
benefits within a year yes I'd say from

133
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,970
a cultivation point of new practices

134
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,220
simple ones mulching you know you're

135
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,690
really trying to build and support the

136
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,780
soil health so that comes with not

137
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:34,779
having bare soil so mulching is a big

138
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:36,759
one I'm also like planting beneficial

139
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:39,159
insect Ares on your edges or in your

140
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,709
feet rose companion planting cover

141
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,210
cropping crop rotation reducing tillage

142
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,519
there's a whole lot of things it depends

143
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,759
on if you're starting where you are but

144
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,469
simple things and kind of also just it's

145
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,300
helpful to take a step back to where you

146
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,740
want to be and then how to do that with

147
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,100
the resources you have on hand

148
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,900
but I guess the goal is to really try to

149
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,879
improve your you know on-site soil

150
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,409
fertility so try to tackle one thing

151
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,000
this plant some concrete put some

152
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,600
chamomile you know different things like

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,879
that

154
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,430
that allow you slowly helped either you

155
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,529
know improve your soil quality and a

156
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,750
nutrient content or also reduce your you

157
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:18,329
know IPM needs I try to tell you know

158
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,329
bring nature into into your grow

159
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,980
and teach online this is question scared

160
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:27,439
to help me and I'll tell you why

161
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,759
just because talked about and I'm gonna

162
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,110
sound like a permaculture listen

163
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,250
permaculturist tend to sound like

164
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:37,189
[ __ ] I'm into that like you know

165
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,720
we're talking about you know thinking

166
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:41,839
about foals and we're talking about

167
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,310
thinking about systems and what we're

168
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,359
talking about now is are the best

169
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:50,600
practices which is a base layer of

170
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:54,170
regenerative thinking and so I think the

171
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,050
best return in a year is to start with

172
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:59,240
you know essence essence is something

173
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,329
that is you know the idea that no two

174
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,980
snowflakes look alike start with essence

175
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:09,769
of self essence of the property that you

176
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:13,730
know the place that you're growing and

177
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:16,579
really good to understand that at a deep

178
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,680
level I think that is the police to

179
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:21,109
start and the things that we're

180
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,100
discussing nowadays these best practices

181
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:28,870
are sort of the functional layers of

182
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:32,750
kind of the one foundational layer of

183
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:35,930
regenerative as a practice applied to

184
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,918
agriculture right on so for this special

185
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,620
were to start with you Jacob

186
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,079
and then John Paul and then column will

187
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,509
jump in again so since some of the

188
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,609
biggest advantages of regenerative

189
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,899
agriculture takes some time to evolve

190
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,729
right where it's the first question was

191
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,529
just about the first year most of the

192
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:53,870
cool stuff about regenerative because

193
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:55,069
five and ten years out since some of the

194
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,418
biggest advantages of regenerative

195
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,829
agriculture take some time we've all

196
00:07:56,418 --> 00:08:00,079
let's talk about the things we can do

197
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:02,478
for the future but take action now

198
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,819
so Jacob what is a regenerative strategy

199
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,399
or series of techniques that take some

200
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:10,189
effort now will result in an outsized

201
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:13,159
advantage down the line yes obviously

202
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:14,750
thing about this and one its it kind of

203
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,790
come up with like a cultivation strategy

204
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,810
but I'm gonna use this opportunity now

205
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,030
so I guess when cultivation type

206
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,399
bringing genetics have

207
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:26,579
stick to your site that's going to

208
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,979
thrive in your specific microclimate and

209
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:30,810
deal with the pest that you have built

210
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,750
up take nutrients and survive you know

211
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,909
the the temperature swings and different

212
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,889
things like that but not everyone is

213
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,679
ready to start doing that so for me you

214
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:42,779
know seed sharing networks but I want to

215
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,379
kind of talk about supporting farmers

216
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:50,490
and supporting your workers and you know

217
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:52,559
creating a healthy positive filling work

218
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,669
environment which comes in from like

219
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,199
you're recruiting giving people

220
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:58,919
opportunities you know across the

221
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,540
spectrum to you know bring in some more

222
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,889
farmers and promote it but I think if

223
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,379
you're looking at like what's gonna pay

224
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:06,870
dividends long-term is building that

225
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:09,419
Network and you know teaching people how

226
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,940
to grow learning sharing knowledge you

227
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,649
know like we're in a situation now

228
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,360
especially if you're a small farmer

229
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,250
you're a homesteader you know there's

230
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,810
big corporations coming and we need to

231
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,799
band together and support each other

232
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,139
it's the only way we're all gonna

233
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,969
survive and I think building those

234
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,519
networks is taking that opportunity and

235
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,139
you know that comes into how do we

236
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,639
compensate or if there's you know

237
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,750
there's financial competition but I

238
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,629
think there's also a lot of other

239
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,519
benefits I would like to see your

240
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:37,620
generative farmer you should be growing

241
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,389
more than just cannabis you know you

242
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,590
shouldn't be mono copying you should be

243
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:42,389
supporting CSAs

244
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,910
or at least providing food to your

245
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:47,460
workers but I think it's providing and

246
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:49,889
you know that kind of fostering of an

247
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,410
environment of you know respecting the

248
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,360
mutual appreciation you're helping the

249
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:56,610
farmer farmers helping you or very

250
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,320
cetera and then the community in general

251
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,539
and I think that's what's really gonna

252
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,850
see dividends in the future it's rather

253
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,519
than styling us and thinking like oh I

254
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,379
have a secret sauce this is my IP this

255
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,449
is my you know edge you know we're all

256
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:12,139
trying to do the same thing when it

257
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,480
comes to regenerative ate path you know

258
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:15,980
forward and

259
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,029
a little bit and we're all learning from

260
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,950
each other so I think it's kind of

261
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:23,629
building that context rather than it

262
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:24,950
specific agricultural thing not great so

263
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:27,320
John Paul this is a more of a

264
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,970
permaculture timeline question right so

265
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,820
what's something that can be done now

266
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,940
that the benefits will cease its are

267
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,860
significant about five or ten years out

268
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,610
yes so how many of you are going

269
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,350
outdoors of all the cultivators so I

270
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,490
think you know specifically for you I

271
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:48,440
think on that baseline this soil health

272
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,769
first and foremost and I think soil

273
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,590
health has you know applications to

274
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:58,639
reduced inputs and and you know lower

275
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:02,540
input cost but also building soil carbon

276
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,379
and if we're able to develop a market

277
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:09,079
for carbon the potential for monetizing

278
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:12,169
ecosystem services monetizing you know

279
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:17,150
carbon credits and so I think from that

280
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:20,929
base level so health is number one and

281
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:23,980
investments you know whether it's show

282
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:26,989
carbon or microbes and I think you know

283
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:30,080
the world of microbes were just you know

284
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,730
you understand it you know more than

285
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,440
most of the world but I think we're just

286
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:37,759
beginning to understand the true

287
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,010
potential and you know but at a very

288
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:46,789
base level for outdoor growers it's it's

289
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:48,590
so yeah I really like what everyone's

290
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,329
sharing hearing from the essence on the

291
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,970
first conversation all the way down to

292
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:55,639
the practices and what I'm hearing is is

293
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,889
honestly it depends on who you are it

294
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,460
depends on where you're growing I think

295
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:03,949
ultimately farmers and farmers of the

296
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,570
grow organically in any kind of crop

297
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,460
understand you're not growing plant

298
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,800
you're growing soil and soils growing

299
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:13,100
plants so you've gotta focus on it and

300
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:15,289
it takes a long time to turn soil from a

301
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,370
degraded soil to a soil that I can

302
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:19,679
actually can sustain life on its own

303
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,929
minimal inputs and so that time line is

304
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,088
critical and we're talking decades in

305
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:26,399
some cases in extreme cases and so

306
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:30,120
that's a big deal I would say on a

307
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,370
broader level do you have plan and do

308
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,490
you have a goal if you don't have the

309
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,889
vision that destination that's where you

310
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:40,139
have to start you know and it's going to

311
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,799
be different depending on the necess of

312
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:45,240
your property and where you are

313
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,250
geographically do you have to capture

314
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,100
the water some places you do some places

315
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,710
that's not on them a major priority the

316
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,120
soil is always going to be important the

317
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,300
amount of inputs is always going to be

318
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,759
important your culture on your farm and

319
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:02,278
the people that you surround yourself

320
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,470
with that's sustainable living as far as

321
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,149
I'm concerned it's choices who do you

322
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,730
want to be around who do one hold it

323
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:12,120
this life with and so all this thing is

324
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:14,399
all these details are critical and you

325
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,889
know there's a plan there's a

326
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,139
destination there's a goal you have got

327
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:23,250
to understand what that is for you and

328
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,929
then you have strategies you have ways

329
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,589
to get there and then you have this

330
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:30,859
series of tactics that are steps along

331
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:32,940
your journey to make it happen

332
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,310
regenerative agriculture is and I have

333
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,100
going to do that this year it's like

334
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:41,069
this is how I'm going to live my life

335
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:43,920
and you'll always progress year after

336
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,959
year probably for your whole life to

337
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,539
continue to improve those types of

338
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,028
practices so it's a lifestyle and the

339
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:54,480
more you can turn your crop to a

340
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:57,179
sustainable level of of regenerative

341
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,269
agriculture you're gonna see benefits

342
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,278
not only economically from how you're

343
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:04,159
living but the quality of crops that

344
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,720
you're growing improve substantially

345
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,370
they're more organic lifestyles I think

346
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,950
we all know that if we've tried I've

347
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,830
seen some of the end products from that

348
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,110
one that's a great transition I'm going

349
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,360
to pass it down to JP here so because

350
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,399
I'm you know a lot of us have got

351
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,080
regenerative agriculture in our heart

352
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,490
right we want to do the right thing we

353
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,560
want to help the planet we don't want

354
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,480
the runoff from our property to be

355
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,359
causing damage on our neighbor's

356
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,940
properties but at the same time you know

357
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,190
margins are tight in cannabis and and

358
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,260
sometimes regenerative agriculture is

359
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,090
considered to be you know time consuming

360
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,710
and laborious and you gotta buy inputs

361
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,269
and sometimes it's just easier to buy a

362
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,629
bottled something on the shelf and go

363
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:47,720
with that

364
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:47,720
right but it's surprising how

365
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,150
financially smart doing regenerative

366
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:55,529
agriculture can be so so with you we'll

367
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:58,110
start with you on this one John Paul and

368
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,819
then Jacob and then Colin so to many

369
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,740
folks regenerative practices appear

370
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,050
expensive in the short term in time

371
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,220
labor and sometimes inputs but those of

372
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:06,870
us are further down the regenerative

373
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,330
path know that regenerative actually

374
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,909
saves money and increases yields both

375
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,320
now and over time so JP please describe

376
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:15,480
a way that you've seen regenerative

377
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,900
practices directly impact the bottom

378
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:24,629
line and create increase revenue sure so

379
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:27,329
you know I think I can apply it I think

380
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:30,240
to to our own company or a regenerative

381
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,879
company and do work with Carol Sanford

382
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,509
who's a really great thinker on

383
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:38,149
regenerative as applied to business and

384
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:40,350
I think you can translate that to

385
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:43,079
agriculture as well so if you haven't

386
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:47,190
seen her work I would highly recommend

387
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,620
looking into it but the idea again

388
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:54,030
starting with essence understanding our

389
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,429
essence as a company which you know

390
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,769
fortunately or unfortunately tendus

391
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:04,289
tends to stem from the founder depending

392
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:05,759
on who it is but and then really why

393
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:09,480
that's important is because in a

394
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,629
marketplace no one you know if essence

395
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,629
is unique and innate no one can copy it

396
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:17,250
if you understand that then it makes you

397
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:18,600
you know non-displaced on the market

398
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,448
then it's incinerate

399
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,670
for what we call our stakeholders in

400
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:25,859
traditional business or say in

401
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:27,629
agriculture you know it's tended to be

402
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,360
pretty biopic we have a

403
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:32,309
multi-stakeholder approach where we talk

404
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,409
about our customers are co-creators

405
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:37,638
which is you know the folks that work

406
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:41,250
with us and then supply chain community

407
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,649
the earth and then also investors and

408
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,019
how do we add value and you talked about

409
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,549
things in balance I think that another

410
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,578
term in terms of regeneration is

411
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:55,620
reciprocity in the system and so it

412
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:57,568
really is is about the critical reason I

413
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,730
pointed to question number one in terms

414
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:03,958
of like one of these best practices that

415
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:06,679
we can get to to return in a year is

416
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:11,879
because there's no best practice that

417
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:13,709
you can just adopt that you know what

418
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,439
might work for another might you know

419
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,900
not work for you might not work for the

420
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,659
property that you're on and there's an

421
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,400
old saying of like you know you could

422
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:29,400
take the engine of like a Mercedes and

423
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,470
BMW I don't know what car for BMW and

424
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,750
you know if you took the best pieces of

425
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,150
those and put those together in another

426
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,950
engine it wouldn't work because it's

427
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:42,048
about the you know it's about the whole

428
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:44,610
it's about the system and for us

429
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:46,200
understanding not only our essence but

430
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:48,439
then the essence of our customers which

431
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,240
is unique rightly so we work with

432
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,429
multi-state operators who want to grow

433
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,519
and want standardized operating

434
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:59,340
procedures but as you guys know like

435
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,168
every girl is different every room

436
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:03,329
within a Grove can be different right if

437
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:05,549
we're talking indoor and so to apply

438
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:08,759
best practices to that just just doesn't

439
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:10,889
work and so seeing customers from the

440
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:15,109
essence of what they want to achieve has

441
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:17,909
opened up a great deal of you know

442
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:20,538
ability for us to help make their lives

443
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:23,280
better and so from a farming perspective

444
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:23,929
you know again starting with yourself in

445
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,819
terms of the SA

446
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:27,980
what you want to achieve what the land

447
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:31,638
is able to achieve and getting to know

448
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:34,970
your in customers and their lives and

449
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:41,839
what they want to achieve I think really

450
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:43,808
helps to improve the value and that

451
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:49,278
exchange of value that reciprocity

452
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:52,519
across the system okay so I'm just

453
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:55,220
telling you said SOP is triggered

454
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:58,159
something so say for my answer to this

455
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,200
question on where to find you know

456
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,129
returns on this video getting certified

457
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,330
which kind of comes in to documentation

458
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:07,339
record-keeping writing down what you're

459
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:09,859
doing for a whole suite of reasons but

460
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:12,019
one is you know you should be planning

461
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:13,638
before this season figure out what's

462
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,200
going on in that season what worked with

463
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:17,329
dinner so that you can refer back to it

464
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,788
and build your own Farmers Almanac but

465
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:22,398
then also you know to have a genuine

466
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:27,169
interaction with the consumer consumers

467
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:29,689
are hungry for buying you know cannabis

468
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:31,788
have that is you know aligned with their

469
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,798
values you know they now have access to

470
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:36,048
information they're entitled to

471
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,509
information you know smart consumers we

472
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:40,638
all want that and they're they're

473
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:41,749
starting to ask for you know certified

474
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,990
products there is still a lot of

475
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:46,850
greenwashing in cannabis and so through

476
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,829
son-in and certified and the cannabis

477
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:50,329
Conservancy they're like you know simply

478
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:53,298
serve I think that we we work with

479
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:55,398
district distributors brands buyers for

480
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:57,798
regenerated farms sustainable farms to

481
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:59,538
try to guarantee them you know premiums

482
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,950
from their product and you know what I

483
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:03,109
would like to see is all of the

484
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,960
certifications working together to have

485
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:08,178
a organic you know certified shelf in

486
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,919
the dispensary and I think that's a big

487
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:11,210
thing is you know putting her and all

488
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,470
our money where our mouth is but like

489
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:17,869
opening our grows and with the consumer

490
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,940
you know I was seeing about this the

491
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:22,240
other day we're a lot like the winery

492
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:26,350
industry on some level and there

493
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,670
million wines out there and like I like

494
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:29,139
wine but like I couldn't tell you know

495
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,009
the differences between all these

496
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,720
different you know where those are

497
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:33,490
something but it's it if I could go to a

498
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,039
winery then I kind of had that

499
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,109
connection so I go to a farm I'm more

500
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,149
likely to have loyalty to that farmer

501
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:41,889
who want that farm to understand how it

502
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,330
was grown and I think you know having

503
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,910
that connection which the kind of a

504
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:47,259
certification does but then also you

505
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,759
know it's just different partnerships

506
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:51,879
that we can have with you know but

507
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:54,279
tenders in the dispensary of as best as

508
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,500
possible showing the consumer where and

509
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,759
how and who is growing their cannabis I

510
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,769
think is that's what really pays

511
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,179
dividends in with different sheets you

512
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:07,599
know regenerative farms when every other

513
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:09,610
farm out there and so so I think what

514
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:14,949
I've had to it's what's been shared is

515
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:16,779
you know we're talking about a wood and

516
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,150
we're also talking about this how I

517
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:23,109
think we've identified that how is

518
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:26,170
different depending on who you are what

519
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:30,459
your farm looks like the needs that you

520
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:34,450
have to get to this what but for me this

521
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:37,900
is also about a y-you know at the end of

522
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:40,150
the day we are people and we're all

523
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,950
driven by a why I know I am in

524
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,540
particular that's what we started

525
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,950
organic microbial company from the

526
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:46,480
University because we're bringing nature

527
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,640
to agriculture and that's what I've been

528
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,740
thinking about for decades

529
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,259
and I realize that my fundamental

530
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,740
scientific training could be applied to

531
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:59,470
bring value to farmers and help me

532
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,259
realize and live my wife and it's a good

533
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,579
thing you have to prosper

534
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:08,200
we should be able to live in abundance

535
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:10,569
as business owners of the growers but it

536
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,500
also and I'll tell you what I think is

537
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:17,139
the value is our Y you know we can reach

538
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:21,308
this destination but we live our whole

539
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:24,580
life in a journey and we'll hit our

540
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:25,638
goals as people who are trying to get to

541
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:28,369
a desk

542
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:31,189
no doubt about it you can walk in a

543
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:35,658
straight line and get places and our

544
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:38,090
whole lives are in that walk and if this

545
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:39,679
is how you want to live your life this

546
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:43,250
is how you want to manage your farm

547
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,679
that's way more valuable then maybe

548
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,990
getting as a extreme example a little

549
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,320
more yield buy porn a bunch of salt and

550
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:53,599
not given a difference you know this

551
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,369
means things to people and the mean

552
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,079
stuff to you and enriches your life and

553
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:59,689
at the end of the day you're not going

554
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:02,658
to think about that extra pound per crop

555
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,038
that you developed by using the salt

556
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:06,769
you're gonna think about how you live

557
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:08,480
your life the way you wanted to live

558
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:11,210
your life and you developed your farm

559
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,788
and you built your soil and it meant

560
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,298
something and it's there after you're

561
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:19,638
gone and honestly that's what we should

562
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:22,339
be doing focusing on a why and for me

563
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:23,898
this topic is all about the what you

564
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:25,878
know and it means something and it

565
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:27,378
drives us all up on this stage I'm sure

566
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:30,109
it drives a lot of you in that audience

567
00:23:27,378 --> 00:23:33,319
also you know if it's not or why it's

568
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:35,839
not it requires extra work it requires a

569
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:39,168
whole different level of Management and

570
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,759
it's a different lifestyle for many many

571
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,480
people they wouldn't have it any other

572
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,759
way

573
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,480
you know I'd deal with them all the time

574
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,259
and I love it and so it's a choice

575
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,538
there's trade-offs

576
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:56,509
there's no perfection but the value can

577
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:58,308
go way beyond that extra whatever if

578
00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:00,079
you're talking about money you know

579
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:02,690
you're talking with the wrong guy to

580
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,548
care less about a dollar I care about

581
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,460
the well in my life and I care about a

582
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:09,798
why that I have and we're allowed to

583
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:13,159
have one more why but this is a big one

584
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:16,460
and it's a special thing to follow and I

585
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:19,220
think it's more gratifying and more

586
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,750
rewarding than anything I'll ever look

587
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,430
at how bank account

588
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,329
and that doesn't mean you have to

589
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:29,820
sacrifice the other it's just a trade us

590
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:32,059
but you want to look at as a business

591
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:32,059
also

592
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:42,960
so I grieve that the so one of the

593
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,400
things that you didn't mention my my

594
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,019
grandfather was nominated as the

595
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,019
agricultural citizen in the century in

596
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:50,519
Wyoming and a lot of the things that he

597
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:52,559
could help pioneer were some of the

598
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,500
things we're trying to move beyond with

599
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,629
regard to regenerative AG and the reason

600
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,390
that I'm sort harping on this idea of

601
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:04,140
like you can't you know take best

602
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,730
practices and apply it without some

603
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,790
understanding of like a baseline the

604
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,710
essence right because that's what

605
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:12,599
industrial agriculture was it was really

606
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,720
like how do we take this method of what

607
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:18,689
we're doing and apply it across any

608
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,870
landscape will flap it will remove trees

609
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,430
will do all those things and where we're

610
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:28,589
living with the repercussions of that

611
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:30,000
right but for farmers and you know one

612
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:32,069
of the things you mentioned a challenge

613
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,349
with these things right with

614
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:37,230
regenerative organic and their standards

615
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:41,429
and typically with consumer advances

616
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:44,160
that we're putting the risk of these

617
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:47,580
things on the most vulnerable right

618
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,800
which is the farmer and that that's a

619
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,569
challenge but I think part of in terms

620
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:56,869
of the long-term horizon from my

621
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:59,129
perspective we have undervalued assets

622
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:03,119
and those undervalued assets are our

623
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:05,550
land that we have sort of looked at

624
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:10,109
really extracted like what what can we

625
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:16,460
take out of it but where we are with

626
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:16,459
climate right and what we need to do to

627
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:24,389
slow or maintain a climate that is

628
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:28,019
habitable for people is remove carbon

629
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,770
from the atmosphere that's a six

630
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,900
trillion dollar opportunity

631
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:36,579
right it's a while hemp and cannabis

632
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:39,460
might seem like a huge market it pales

633
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:42,669
in comparison to the market of what

634
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:45,009
carbon will be and so in terms of you

635
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:48,190
know how that frames how you manage

636
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:51,160
today for tomorrow I firmly believe that

637
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,440
the value of carbon in the next decade

638
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,840
hopefully sooner will be realized and

639
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,380
the practices and these regenerative

640
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:02,470
practices will be something that you

641
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:07,510
know returns the balance back to two

642
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:08,620
farmers and so you know I think that you

643
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:10,660
know the only way to change the system

644
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:13,089
that's sort of within a system and so

645
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,190
you know the system of the goddess is

646
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,230
capitalist and the system we got is you

647
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,880
know what we're dealing with today but I

648
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,390
think there's a huge opportunity and

649
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,960
there's six trillion dollar opportunity

650
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:29,500
to manage or that's a port word but to

651
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,308
bring systems back into balance and I

652
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:36,369
think the value of carbon in the soil is

653
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:38,079
going to be an enormous enormous

654
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:40,750
opportunity and I think farmers are

655
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:44,319
positioned very well who start working

656
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:47,319
towards that a day to to benefit from

657
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,450
that and in so doing benefit the people

658
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,669
they work with benefit the communities

659
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:58,120
where they grow community you know

660
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:59,980
benefit the ecosystem and so forth so so

661
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:01,299
one thing I want to add to that is so so

662
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,130
you're in the room and your think about

663
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,589
going into regenerative agriculture and

664
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,360
and like none of the three guys really

665
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:09,579
said you're gonna make more money so let

666
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,169
me be that person what we're finding is

667
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:13,210
with regenerative agriculture is when

668
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:15,460
you use it you're creating higher

669
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,620
yielding plants you spend a month less

670
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,920
money fighting pests because the plants

671
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:22,928
are stronger and they take care of the

672
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:26,650
pest resistance themselves you get a

673
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:29,259
marketing advantage because people want

674
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,750
to buy products that are aligned with

675
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:33,670
their value the quat the the value of

676
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:36,210
your property increases because you're

677
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,369
not dumping sulfates nutrients on it

678
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,749
and like colin was saying when he

679
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:41,668
brought brought out his boss for

680
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:44,069
scientists you just feel better about

681
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:45,360
life so if you're talking with your

682
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:47,490
business partners and you've got to

683
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,949
convince them to go regenerative there

684
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,480
is lots of evidence out there that shows

685
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,399
that you can actually make more money

686
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,980
going with regenerative techniques than

687
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:58,079
you can by using other techniques

688
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,230
alright so with that we're gonna move on

689
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,009
so so we're doing well on time and so

690
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,389
we're gonna ask you guys one more

691
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:05,038
questions that I didn't let you know

692
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:06,748
about in advance and we will have time

693
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,179
for questions so after this question I

694
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:10,440
will come out to you so so you know kind

695
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,240
of get your question in your head we'll

696
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,220
have a good ten minutes for it so so

697
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,558
guys you know one of the things that's

698
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,308
interesting about regenerative is is how

699
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:21,928
we have to balance the competitiveness

700
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:23,548
because we need to make sure that we're

701
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:26,090
in the market and we can sell our

702
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:29,460
products but at the same time we're not

703
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:31,528
competitive because we're all trying to

704
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,169
make regenerative cannabis agriculture a

705
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:36,808
thing right we want there to be more of

706
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:39,720
it both for just you know the quality of

707
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:42,480
cannabis and human life but but but also

708
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,399
because we want it to replace you know

709
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,470
traditional industrial agricultural

710
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,538
practices which could totally take over

711
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:50,009
a cannabis if we regenerative people

712
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:52,048
don't do something about it right so

713
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:53,819
here's my question that I'm Nessen we'll

714
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:57,269
start with JP and head down the line

715
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:58,950
there so in trying to balance the

716
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:01,319
competitiveness because we want to make

717
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:04,110
sure our products are sold but also we

718
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,778
also need to work together in community

719
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:12,359
as regenerative folk and family right

720
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:14,970
give one example that people can use to

721
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:18,058
you know create some kind of partnership

722
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,440
or community with their people who have

723
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:21,509
other farmers who are essentially their

724
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,548
competitors in the marketplace but

725
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:26,429
actually are all part of that

726
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:29,190
regenerative family sure so I think you

727
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:30,659
know I think you might have similar

728
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:36,600
experiences there like both of you but

729
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:39,210
like I think the canvas industry is it's

730
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,619
one where there is this notion of like

731
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,950
protecting

732
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:47,519
nation and it doesn't exist in other you

733
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:50,580
know sectors of Agriculture to the

734
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,759
extent that that it does in cannabis I

735
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:57,019
think what you're missing is a knowledge

736
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:59,700
share right and also just support

737
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:04,049
because if the truth is like this is its

738
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,940
heart and you know the people that can

739
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:07,619
understand best how hard it is or the

740
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,570
people doing it and so on an emotional

741
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:13,428
level it's beneficial right but then

742
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:15,990
there are you know lessons there are

743
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:19,650
bits of knowledge that can that can be

744
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:21,179
shared and you know we're we were

745
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:26,100
talking about sort of putting together

746
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:28,590
like a group of cultivators to just get

747
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:30,359
together not trying to sell [ __ ] but

748
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:33,659
just get together and just talk and

749
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,969
share it and because I think a lot of

750
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,620
growers feel pretty isolated this but we

751
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,019
understand and that's it that's a shame

752
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,719
because what that leads to is really

753
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:46,319
great people decided not to continue

754
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,600
forward right and so I think there needs

755
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,980
to be more and I think there's a dearth

756
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:57,149
of you know community beyond sort of

757
00:31:52,980 --> 00:32:00,120
surface service level and I know you

758
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:02,250
know from a CEO perspective which is you

759
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,349
know pretty much most cultivators are

760
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:09,569
sort of the CEO it's a very isolating

761
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:12,359
you know activity you're sort of you

762
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:16,109
know solo and I think that a community

763
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,729
of people who can understand and go

764
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:21,599
beyond just empathy but sort of really

765
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:24,269
understand it is beneficial so there's

766
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:27,480
not a lot of it I think there is there

767
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:29,670
needs to be more with it I think getting

768
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,089
back to essence I think the essence

769
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,590
discussion removes this notion of

770
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:38,720
competitiveness

771
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:42,230
and what is really a neoliberal myth I

772
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:47,900
think is like the basis of essence is

773
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:50,630
like you can't be me right I can't be

774
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,690
you and depending on what you believe

775
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:56,510
right like we're we right whatever but

776
00:32:53,690 --> 00:33:00,320
like that essence aspect is is critical

777
00:32:56,509 --> 00:33:02,829
because if you understand that and you

778
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:06,109
stay true to it then you have no fear of

779
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:08,689
somebody you know there's no competition

780
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,278
in that respect so that's why I think

781
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,960
essence in this discussion of

782
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:13,159
regeneration is a very very critical

783
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,350
point to understand

784
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,760
thanks JP so Jacob you mentioned one

785
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:19,398
earlier that I really like which is the

786
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:22,099
regional seed swapping group right so

787
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:26,239
that's a that's a great idea what would

788
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:27,740
tell one thing is cuz like regenerate

789
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,710
it's like we're building this movement

790
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,210
and what we're seeing a lot and a little

791
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,590
bit in Colorado a lot in Northern

792
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,610
California we do a lot of her work out

793
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:38,990
there is being a regenerative farmer

794
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:40,839
abiding by these practices you know

795
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,339
working towards that has formed

796
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,869
partnerships with others similar like my

797
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:46,808
did you know social subscribing

798
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:49,548
individuals were in the distribution

799
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:51,558
manufacturing ranks where we are having

800
00:33:49,548 --> 00:33:52,879
farmers now that are pre selling their

801
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:54,980
product for their ever harvest the end

802
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,570
there's takes a huge relief off of them

803
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,130
because they know that it's going to

804
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:59,898
have either the bagged appeal the

805
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,590
terpene profile you for me girls are

806
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:02,898
gonna be huge

807
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:04,298
I hope so coming up you know so it's

808
00:34:02,898 --> 00:34:06,859
tough losing these you know kind of

809
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:08,088
arbitrary strain names that we'd be

810
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:09,529
giving you and really go into what the

811
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,849
turkey profile is so you know the

812
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,399
effects they're gonna have on us but

813
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:15,530
that's one that's another thing but I'm

814
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:17,000
having that but then I'm having the

815
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,619
quality that they know that you know

816
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,820
especially manufacturers you know so

817
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:22,220
they're coming down to the farms and

818
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,720
they're you know harvesting all of the

819
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:25,730
odds were bucking it right down there

820
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,168
you know and then taking it away and

821
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,570
paying for all that and the farmers just

822
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:32,088
gets us you know set them out right

823
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,710
there per pound that's a huge relief so

824
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:35,809
they don't have to worry about you know

825
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,909
the drying the curing all of that space

826
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:39,299
on-site we're also seeing you know

827
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,970
valleys and different

828
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,830
sheds where the cultivation of climates

829
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:46,319
are very similar are coming together and

830
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:47,759
you know sharing barn space big thing is

831
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,050
sharing harvesting you know

832
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,520
opportunities not everyone's gonna

833
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,230
harvest the exact same times instead of

834
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:54,690
having to hire another place you can

835
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,579
share you know there and really kind of

836
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,190
like the whole barn raising mentality of

837
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:01,380
back in the day easily translates into

838
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,710
you know into cannabis but then I think

839
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,329
a big part of that is also just having

840
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,280
those connections within the farmer

841
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:09,569
community to kind of know what's on the

842
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,760
back you know Mother Nature throws stuff

843
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,740
at us every single day it's really

844
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,360
helpful here's someone you know 20 miles

845
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:17,669
south like hey strips are coming through

846
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,650
you know we have this rustic way and

847
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:22,769
this is what I've done over the last 20

848
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,960
years - that works you know and so we're

849
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:26,670
not trying things on our own and taking

850
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,220
a salesman's word for it but we've got

851
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,780
farmers who've actually do it and you

852
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:33,059
know it's succeeding with one of the new

853
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,470
things I've been seeing is farmers -

854
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:36,029
companion planting with a can of meal

855
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:38,309
and are swearing that they're getting

856
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,840
boosted to see percentages and that

857
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:41,429
they're about to even better for making

858
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,059
you know hash and concentrate since they

859
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:48,029
get used thanks camomile so going cameo

860
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,829
like interspersed in the beds you know

861
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,500
but there's like some you know

862
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:54,750
particular strategies with it but I read

863
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,190
it from 10 farms in sugar you know that

864
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,900
they're like yeah it's working a piece

865
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,250
you know I like when those things are

866
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,599
like I feel pretty confident telling you

867
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,289
guys and you should check it out like

868
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,269
you know I haven't read any bad things

869
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:07,829
from it you know it might affect your

870
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:09,659
watering shutter use a little bit if you

871
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:11,250
really you know really dialed it in on

872
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:13,259
your trip I want to think about that but

873
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,300
like things like that rather than just

874
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,890
hearing it or reading about it you know

875
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,050
on social media or something about

876
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:21,059
having those farmers that are growing in

877
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:26,670
the same microclimate that you are at

878
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:28,170
what's working and what is in it yeah I

879
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,579
really love what everyone shared and I

880
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,340
think about the same things I think

881
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:32,849
about collaborative thing about behind

882
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,680
share

883
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:37,199
you know co-op is one of the things

884
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:39,359
that's a big word in in NorCal or

885
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,589
sun-grown cooperatives where people are

886
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,200
actually banding together

887
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,940
to take a distribution in hell it's more

888
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,469
of the distribution space in the

889
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,630
Northern California market where you

890
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:52,259
know if you're very armed for craft

891
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:55,500
farmers to out-compete everybody it's

892
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:58,380
just not realistic you have so much more

893
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,809
control of your channel if you're

894
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,309
working together at least in the state

895
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:04,440
of their companies you know and I think

896
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:06,150
about it from the micro to a perspective

897
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,670
and atlas product you know everyone

898
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,470
asked what I can competitors I go what

899
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,960
competitors the other companies that are

900
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:14,909
making microbes that I love and this

901
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,559
movement and this value and that's why

902
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:18,779
they're doing the same thing you're not

903
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,029
my competitors they're not allies

904
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,710
I'll sell their products right along

905
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,019
with mine and I want to encourage people

906
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,780
to use those products along with mine

907
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:30,119
they're ones like huh that's a little

908
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,940
different it's the power of a why you

909
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:36,000
know legitimate a farmer's syndrome

910
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:38,389
farmers all these concepts work well

911
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:44,219
together and if you collaborate

912
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:46,799
community line share it works it doesn't

913
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:49,679
have to be a fear-based competition and

914
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,620
honestly talk about the high high tide

915
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,659
rises all ships it's just true and it

916
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:57,210
starts with that that collaboration and

917
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:58,710
community in my opinion that's fantastic

918
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,210
all right so we got about 10 minutes for

919
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:04,530
questions

920
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,530
[Applause]

921
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,750
about ten minutes for questions I want

922
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:10,699
to let the three of you know that each

923
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,318
of you are invited to respond but don't

924
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:13,578
feel like you have to jump on a question

925
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:15,139
that you know you don't really have

926
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:17,059
anything on and we'll just move along

927
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:19,150
but but if all three of you want to get

928
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:21,710
on a question you know don't hesitate

929
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:25,309
Shango thanks guys

930
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:29,510
not all of us armours have filled in

931
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:30,740
soil that we can work with some of us

932
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:34,220
really want to bring on that

933
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:36,259
regenerative mindset to the way we do

934
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:40,429
things maybe in a greenhouse in

935
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:42,710
containers or in indoor spaces and can

936
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:45,558
you speak on some regenerative practices

937
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:48,199
for folks or in those situations

938
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:50,269
exciting as we all start getting a right

939
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:52,460
to grow a lot of us have been able to

940
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:55,190
grow in our backyards or in our house

941
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:58,460
and our tents and so what our solution

942
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:01,298
into the practices that we can do to be

943
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,960
in line with that kind of philosophy and

944
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:05,840
thinking

945
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,230
so if I'm like any door bro environment

946
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,760
or Jenna's a lid and soil if you can and

947
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,010
start to go in there and even if you're

948
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,350
growing in pots use that soil finest

949
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:17,180
phase compost it and get soil test so

950
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:19,429
it's a certain huge yeah so therefore

951
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:21,649
you're not guessing but you can really

952
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:23,359
dial in precisely how much nutrients

953
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,710
that soil needs and we're do you know

954
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,690
how to apply it when to apply it and

955
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,400
that's gonna gonna you know change a bit

956
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,599
and I think confidence we thought we

957
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,820
thought of that but like when it comes

958
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,679
like that BK stuff and and what we need

959
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,530
and you know this my biology but I think

960
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:38,719
also man enduro is as we do a lot of

961
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:40,280
sustainability for indoor grows is

962
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,709
looking at your like energy water and

963
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,600
waste streams and how he gives as simple

964
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,820
as how are you sourcing or products you

965
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,289
know if you can buy super sex and use

966
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,769
them by that rather than you know

967
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:54,110
plastic palletized you know bags of soil

968
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:55,579
and reduce your waste they're actually

969
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,410
measure what your waste is every week

970
00:39:55,579 --> 00:40:00,440
and and what are you looking at what's

971
00:39:57,409 --> 00:40:01,940
compostable what's you know plastics

972
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,230
recyclables and then what's just gonna

973
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,450
be soluble useful ways it's gonna go to

974
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,740
landfill and how you do it and what is

975
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:08,389
it I mean there's always gonna be gloves

976
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:09,679
you know you can't really get away from

977
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:12,170
that but kind of you don't really

978
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,759
fine-tune it and then your lighting

979
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:18,559
systems you know really look at your

980
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:21,590
ppfd and you know can you afford to get

981
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,029
new lights look at the lighting

982
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:25,940
efficiency of that so I'm like almost

983
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:28,430
per tool you really want I would say 1.9

984
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,710
or above so LEDs even double-ended and

985
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:32,690
it's just how much of the Energy's using

986
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:35,119
is going to be turned into usable light

987
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:37,159
and then look at your distribution of

988
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,079
your legs and try to you know have as

989
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:40,969
much biggest spacing as possible of

990
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:44,389
those lights you can reduce your lights

991
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:46,369
their time of day use and staggering of

992
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:49,069
rooms I mean all of those combined can

993
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:51,230
save you 20 to 30 percent of your

994
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:53,150
lighting which Fernando bro could be you

995
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,980
know forty fifty percent of your total

996
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:57,230
row cost so there are a lot of things

997
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,329
there but it's like using data to help

998
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:02,079
inform your decisions and really

999
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:02,079
tracking what that is

1000
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:07,869
all right okay

1001
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:51,849
yes so we're talking about soil not

1002
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:53,559
planet through our products and in in

1003
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,659
natural products out there that you can

1004
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:57,159
probably mitigate a lot of that you know

1005
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:58,719
I think there's composting techniques

1006
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:01,480
depending on the point without where you

1007
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,459
can get rid of my eggs probably burn out

1008
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,170
through the heat of the composting a lot

1009
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,449
of those insects it's a process though

1010
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:11,889
to be clear you there's there's time

1011
00:42:07,449 --> 00:42:13,659
there's resources or a space and to

1012
00:42:11,889 --> 00:42:17,769
actually do that that you can do it and

1013
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:20,139
so I would say also on the front end you

1014
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:24,309
could improve or at least try to

1015
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:27,309
identify your your sources of potential

1016
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:29,920
contamination or her infection and work

1017
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:31,659
on those processes so you don't invite

1018
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,010
those messing whether they come in on

1019
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:35,379
your clothes when they come in on your

1020
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,590
soil identify that because you know once

1021
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:40,240
you got em you got a minute and and

1022
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:42,160
pests and pest pressures everywhere

1023
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:43,509
that's nature you know there's no such

1024
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,239
thing as no pressure

1025
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:48,280
there's just levels of it and so it's a

1026
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,379
probability game and you're playing the

1027
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,750
probability getting there so yeah you

1028
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,119
can treat everything you once you have

1029
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,409
something you might always have a level

1030
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,719
of it you want to keep it low enough

1031
00:42:56,409 --> 00:43:01,089
that you can manage and so thinking

1032
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:04,689
about your front-end processes you know

1033
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,900
people not only spores covering them but

1034
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,400
you

1035
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:11,740
Leyton potentially as soon as you grow

1036
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:14,619
so forget the blush and so we have to

1037
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:23,259
just look at battle that at how we're

1038
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:26,920
managing well so I think one thing is

1039
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:29,770
farmers are notorious for not valuing

1040
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,900
their time and so what I would say is

1041
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:34,389
you know this is like a DC front like

1042
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,900
it's easy for me like you know we have

1043
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:39,699
quality analytics that we deliver with

1044
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,639
every batch of soil because we're

1045
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:44,500
testing and we are testing those things

1046
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:48,219
so you know exactly what comes into your

1047
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:51,250
Grove because we know the impact that

1048
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:54,159
pests can have you know and and how

1049
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,599
important it is to have really good

1050
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:59,109
understanding what's coming in on the

1051
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,659
front end and so from my perspective

1052
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:04,329
this is part of the reason why we exist

1053
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:06,519
I think it's you know who you're working

1054
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:09,130
with and the co-creators are the

1055
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:12,429
suppliers that are supplying you goods

1056
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:14,110
we shipped directly to growers for that

1057
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:16,719
reason because we can manage the supply

1058
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:18,370
chain and we know exactly you know it

1059
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:22,959
came from our door and then to your door

1060
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:24,849
we know you know the analytics when it

1061
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,329
left our facility and arrived at your

1062
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:33,759
door and so I think that's pretty

1063
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:35,679
grateful and that's why we exist I would

1064
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,540
say a couple things to think about the

1065
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,789
media situation with the mics and all

1066
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:41,230
that would be solarization is one thing

1067
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:43,630
recovery in thick plastic you know

1068
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:46,000
letting it really heat up predatory

1069
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:47,890
mites and it potentially planting trap

1070
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,449
plants in there depending on the mic so

1071
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:50,980
plants the mites are gonna love that you

1072
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:53,289
can then remove and take them off site

1073
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,940
or just some ideas but things ever ties

1074
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:56,769
into the whole regenerate thing is that

1075
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,780
we're trying to create ecosystem to

1076
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:00,369
mimic nature within our grossman each

1077
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,440
it's going to work for us and nature

1078
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:04,900
abhors a vacuum so if you have a really

1079
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,970
well balanced ecosystem you're gonna

1080
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:10,180
have mites but they'll never get to like

1081
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:10,719
you know population explosion to where

1082
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:13,029
they're going to be

1083
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,709
huge problem you know they're really

1084
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:16,390
gonna target your wheat plants which is

1085
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,670
kind of nature indicating a plant

1086
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:19,690
doesn't need to be here anyways and so

1087
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,849
instead of using a lot of pesticides

1088
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,619
over you know plants a little ten

1089
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:26,769
percent more and then thin it out as

1090
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:28,180
needed and just do that and then breed

1091
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:29,530
of what you're really seeing on your

1092
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:31,389
property all these plants are feeling it

1093
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,400
right now or they're mic resistant never

1094
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:35,529
had an issue this is genetics we want to

1095
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,690
you know keep going so just somebody

1096
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:38,700
else right got time for one last

1097
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:41,108
question

1098
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:43,659
how you doing this question is to

1099
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:46,719
mammoth it's off the first time for just

1100
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:48,279
get my first girl who September so I've

1101
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,618
talked to you on the internet about

1102
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:54,099
seeing somebody that was using your name

1103
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:56,230
trying to make something but found out I

1104
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:57,730
looked at the scene that the number was

1105
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,639
on his hand see that it said man we

1106
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:02,500
finished found you so sorry this company

1107
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,569
must be somebody that there that's

1108
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,489
worthy of the name last money would be

1109
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:10,420
still in it I said you must be fainted

1110
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:13,659
but my question is now using your

1111
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:15,849
product by using product and my first

1112
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:19,239
grow these said that your product keep

1113
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:20,619
edge when I went to the Hydra story so

1114
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:22,539
now my question is when using your

1115
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:24,820
product is that something that I can use

1116
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:26,139
when I build in Richmond of like when

1117
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,180
I'm watering could I put it on my water

1118
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:29,289
process for do I use it like what's the

1119
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:31,329
weekly what's the timeframe that I

1120
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:33,489
should be using a product first of all

1121
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:36,159
congratulations glad you're getting the

1122
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:39,969
grown thanks a lot yeah I have a lot of

1123
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:42,730
imposters on it sorry about that

1124
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:44,019
and yeah you know it's its nature its

1125
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:46,719
nature in a bottle with precision

1126
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:48,940
functionality yes you have a lot of

1127
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:51,279
flexibility I want you to think about

1128
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,079
the performance and the economics you

1129
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,790
can use a continuous a lot of grossly

1130
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:56,949
read results it's a point six mil for

1131
00:46:54,789 --> 00:46:59,469
gallon using it twice a week in your

1132
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:01,309
feed if you have big if you have big V

1133
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,449
tanks you could add in there and

1134
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:06,799
then through the week there's so much

1135
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:09,889
rain go ahead sorry no is that made the

1136
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,110
point six four - ah destroy Balu yeah

1137
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:14,269
that's a great question so across the

1138
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:16,220
board at early on I used to have

1139
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:18,050
different regimes for a soil versus

1140
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:20,989
hydroponics through hydroponics and what

1141
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,820
we realize is with regular applications

1142
00:47:20,989 --> 00:47:44,269
the data seems so similar with the

1143
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:46,550
quality brings more results won't cause

1144
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:48,349
an issue it's just a diminishing return

1145
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,580
you're gonna find that balance where

1146
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:51,769
you're not going to get deference for

1147
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:53,480
every by that but the actual ad isn't so

1148
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:54,829
