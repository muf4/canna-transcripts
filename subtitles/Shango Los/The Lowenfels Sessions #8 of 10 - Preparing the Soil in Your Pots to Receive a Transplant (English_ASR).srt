1
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,890
every year farmers everywhere are

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:18,969
preparing their soil for the new season

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:22,149
and and no a key part of this soil is

4
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:24,429
everybody wants these complex mycelial

5
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:27,189
networks because these these fungal

6
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:30,000
networks move around nutrients and

7
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:33,939
communication and and they you know they

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,310
create a thriving soil food web and this

9
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:38,979
is why people are so in a note oh right

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,770
because you go from season to season and

11
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:43,779
this this web if you will stays

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,080
consistent from season to season but

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,910
lots of folks have got to move into new

14
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,439
soil either they're expanding their grow

15
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:54,399
or there's something wrong with the old

16
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:57,009
soil or whatever and but if you're going

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,560
to transplant cannabis into one of these

18
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:03,309
pots you want to have some kind of

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,799
maturity in the pot already so that you

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,290
know you can end up with by the end of

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,580
your cannabis cycle that's when the soil

22
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,600
is actually good right because it's

23
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:12,670
gonna take the whole life of the

24
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:16,419
cannabis plant for the my ceiling

25
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,969
networks to to come into being what

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:24,399
would you recommend could be done to

27
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:26,709
these pots before season so that by the

28
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:29,530
time you're transplanting into these

29
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:31,389
pots they're already mycelium rich and

30
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,978
ready to rock good question

31
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,159
really good question let me go back

32
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:38,259
first over corrected no-till it's one

33
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,999
reason you don't know till there are

34
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:42,218
lots of other reasons not the least of

35
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:44,199
which is that the whole soil food web

36
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:46,538
not just the micro zone network gets

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,549
gets messed up on you when you fill up

38
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:50,009
the song you know like say when you kind

39
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,659
of warm in half you don't get to worms

40
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,688
so so you gotta be careful that's that's

41
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,569
that's you know only one reason as far

42
00:01:55,688 --> 00:02:02,468
as the mycorrhizal fungi are concerned

43
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:05,260
they require a plant to survive so there

44
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:08,069
are no mycorrhizal fungi ink

45
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,539
when I when I give advice when I advise

46
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,919
indoor cannabis you know people call me

47
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,909
up and say okay what do you charge back

48
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:19,209
back back and so so my advice is always

49
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:22,120
a stunner to them when they find out

50
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,780
that that what they need to do is do

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,409
what you're doing

52
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:30,449
start early get that so conditioned put

53
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:34,680
a cover crop in get that cover crop to

54
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:38,259
feed a throw or to grow a thriving

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,730
mycelium Network you got about a month

56
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:43,209
month and a half that's that's probably

57
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:46,810
enough time it certainly can't hurt and

58
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:49,719
and then when you put your plant in

59
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,849
there it sends out signals to get the

60
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,609
mycorrhizal to come to it there may be

61
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:58,359
mycorrhizal already growing which it can

62
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,960
feed into so that's key I also take

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,990
mycorrhizal fungal product and I mix it

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:08,700
in my soil so that as the plant grows

65
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:11,469
during the season the roots grow into

66
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,959
mycorrhizal fungi and are able to

67
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:16,479
establish new colonies and you end up

68
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,390
with colonies on the new rooms as well

69
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,759
as the older roots which is key so you

70
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:24,099
want to add it to your soil when you put

71
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,989
your pots together by the way you want

72
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:28,509
to keep that that phosphorous in

73
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,159
particular but nitrogen as well those

74
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:32,889
numbers need to be low or the

75
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,289
mycorrhizae fungi will never grow and

76
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:38,859
then put in something so that you get a

77
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:40,870
signal from a plant that activates the

78
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,340
memorising it's like the spark of life

79
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,569
that gets things going and it's

80
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,550
definitely the plant I think it's I can

81
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:52,060
see them they named it after a plant

82
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,519
stigma something other and the plant

83
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,219
definitely sends the signal out the

84
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,490
fungi and says come hither and if the

85
00:03:57,219 --> 00:04:02,520
plant doesn't do that don't make noise

86
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,500
has no idea that the plant is there Wow

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,780
but you're right the network then

88
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,180
becomes a wonderful feeding network now

89
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,039
maybe we should just spend a little

90
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,170
teeny bit of time talking about why do

91
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,479
people use new soil all the time tends

92
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,550
to be a knee-jerk reaction again when I

93
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,319
advise growers particularly indoor

94
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:22,110
growers because that's people come to me

95
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,599
more often than outdoors you know

96
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,639
they're dumb fabulous no that's where

97
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,970
your phone that's where well even with a

98
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,589
male plant don't throw that soil out

99
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,290
chances are when you think about it you

100
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:35,609
realize wait a second I mean that's

101
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,960
wrong on that so it's been used once

102
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,389
before it might need a little bit of

103
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,049
nutrient in it but that plant that I had

104
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,879
in it before set out extra dates there

105
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,370
in that soil already Wow

106
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,189
if probably brought in the microbes that

107
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:53,579
I want there and that soil already there

108
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:56,850
are there are root color passages that

109
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:59,609
the new plant can utilize and grow with

110
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,480
much less effort there's organic

111
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,150
material left by those old roots the old

112
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:10,170
rhizosphere is still there holy all this

113
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:12,329
stuff is valuable so so really think

114
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:15,810
hard and long about what do you want to

115
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:17,399
use the new soil it really is amazing to

116
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,319
people again particularly these large

117
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,989
commercial indoor growers of a big

118
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:27,930
advice whoa whoa they say you would save

119
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:30,689
money oh my god isn't it huge savings so

120
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:34,079
I and I think yeah that would better

121
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:36,660
soil so last year was my first year to

122
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,609
experiment with with cover crops right

123
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,280
and it does make a huge difference

124
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,650
especially in keeping the soil

125
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,809
pleasantly moist yeah that's right here

126
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:48,089
I also realized that there's a lot of

127
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,280
variability in cover crop right some of

128
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:52,079
it grows more than you wanted to do and

129
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,019
get to be a hassle what do you recommend

130
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,539
as being a good easy cover crop yeah you

131
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:59,859
know

132
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:01,300
I like the red clovers it's it's it

133
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,150
depends not where you live like thank

134
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,350
you so what I do in Anchorage Alaska's

135
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:07,839
gonna be different than what you do down

136
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,310
here is it clover the same everywhere

137
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,199
well it is but I mean there were other

138
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,470
stuff that people have and - oh I sinned

139
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,279
and yeah well in some places it really

140
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,360
grows crazy in Anchorage it grows nuts

141
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,089
and so if you're not careful the

142
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,500
seedling can get inundated but once you

143
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,699
get that plant up and running then it

144
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,519
doesn't matter what you have in there

145
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,289
but oh my gosh it's fun to do it looks

146
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,389
kind of fun

147
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,890
and it's a living mulch so the many ways

148
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,740
it takes care of that mulch and buffing

149
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:38,579
that particularly as these as they die

150
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,410
and start feeding stuff it's just do

151
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:44,379
encourage that you said as they die and

152
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,270
I know that some folks when the the when

153
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:47,829
they get certain pipe they just go ahead

154
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:49,659
and scissor and cut them through and

155
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,620
like that's laborious right not for big

156
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,780
you know big

157
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,310
rows but it's for hunger so do you think

158
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:57,399
that's worthwhile at all or just ignore

159
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,870
just let it die on their own their own

160
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,159
sometimes sometimes it turns out where I

161
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,610
am you're one that when I'm traveling

162
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,550
what not but yeah you know we do we do a

163
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,310
lot of work and sometimes it's just pays

164
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,920
not to it's just too much work

165
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,800
well not fun yeah one more question on

166
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,790
the on the cover crop so one of the

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,250
common opinions against cover crop is

168
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:24,040
that that cover crop is stealing my

169
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,139
nutrients for the plant know that cover

170
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,439
crop should be putting nutrients in the

171
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,819
soil for your plant so if it's stealing

172
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,519
nutrients for your plant using the wrong

173
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,170
Carver crop it's supposed to be making

174
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,839
nitrogen that's why we use nitrogen

175
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:40,000
fixing when you will you use those

176
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,219
nitrogen fixers with mycorrhizal fungi

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,410
you get increased nodules you get you

178
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,270
know it's just you got to use the right

179
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,100
stuff so I think it's properties on a

180
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:50,769
misunderstanding of just thinking that

181
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,200
oh the plant is growing and therefore

182
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:54,729
it's a zero-sum competition between the

183
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,349
handless plant and the cover crop and

184
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,000
that's just false s-pulse that's

185
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,189
completely false and you're getting soil

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,860
structure I have a friend who did the

187
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:07,310
yeah landscape real in its debut for the

188
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,960
st. Louis Arch and he got there and she

189
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,079
thought it was terrible and it was

190
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,849
compacted so he he in the fall he

191
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:18,050
planted long turnips

192
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,710
people are saying Louis look at the hell

193
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,689
are you doing this boy this is art look

194
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,939
an acre is next you you know maybe

195
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:27,290
that's Ireland and the finest greatest

196
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,899
stuff in the world cover crops work

197
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,610
there's a reason people use them and

198
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,990
they make a great deal of sense and

199
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,610
people might want to think about it

200
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,580
again I tell you indoor growers this as

201
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,580
well you know sometimes you have a

202
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,139
fallow field you don't so you just put

203
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,990
the cover crop it you don't put the

204
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,939
cannabis in it for a crop let it just

205
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,889
spend half a season or season growing

206
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,480
the cover crop yeah there you go yeah I

207
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:52,069
think I think you know we kind of expand

208
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,810
our thinking about this stuff where were

209
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,490
too we're too fixated on a hydroponic

210
00:08:55,809 --> 00:09:02,779
model because that's what we all had

211
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,350
back when I was a kid and we don't

212
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,259
happen anymore

213
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,470
I was I was at the regenerative cannabis

214
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:11,929
conference a few weeks ago and and

215
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:16,009
layton Morrison was talking about how he

216
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:17,750
really likes radishes as a cover crop

217
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:20,990
because I guess they've got a very long

218
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,460
tap root turnip concept no so so that's

219
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,860
gonna say is that the same idea except

220
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,019
at a more reasonable size for container

221
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,519
yeah absolutely the only problem I have

222
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:34,939
with using radishes and turnips for

223
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:37,610
cannabis is they are you know

224
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,350
to be allopathic to micro resolution oh

225
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,419
well that's kind of a big deal yes I

226
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,860
think you gotta pay ten time pretty sure

227
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:46,909
that's the truth I don't think back here

228
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,700
now I think they are members of the Cole

229
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:51,860
family are they radishes cabbages are

230
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,100
they on the same yeah yeah there anyway

231
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,120
run for it so so if somebody's going to

232
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,950
you if somebody's gonna think about

233
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,090
using radishes double check on that yeah

234
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,379
double check on that certainly don't

235
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,019
want to use cabbages I can tell yeah

236
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:05,330
yeah nothing nothing in the rossion

237
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,460
family because they are they are

238
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,320
allopathic and so yeah you know if you

239
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,060
plant in that soil the next season you

240
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,260
get a tough time getting the microscope

241
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:14,259
all right fantastic thank you yeah

242
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,199
you
