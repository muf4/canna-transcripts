27
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,919
so it feels good to come back I've kind

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,810
of gone through some things on Instagram

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,280
with using some marketing companies and

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,170
stuff so I hope to give you guys an

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,409
insider's look on what it really takes

32
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,640
to build your Instagram organically so

33
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,439
it kind of ties it into the way that I

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,060
like to grow cannabis and the same way

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,629
that I like to grow my Instagram account

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,000
so for 2020 I really hope that you guys

37
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,949
start to see that social media is king

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,230
and then if you guys aren't on at least

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,510
Instagram especially for your larger

40
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,820
brands you're really missing out so I

41
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,109
hope to kind of educate you guys and

42
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,569
then like you guys so that at least

43
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:54,950
you'll start that Instagram and it is a

44
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:57,269
daily thing all right

45
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,329
all right so who remembers the mass

46
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:01,949
groups pays anybody in there all right

47
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,260
so that's kind of where I started I

48
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,340
started learning about content creation

49
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,990
that kind of stuff

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,659
and because it was all cannabis related

51
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,539
it was pretty easy to gain followers so

52
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:14,159
I just worked on making sure that my

53
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:15,900
content tempted proving so the first

54
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,789
viral photo that I ever had was this

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,560
photo right here I was done in my

56
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:23,159
basement and I just started growing the

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,599
cover crop improving clones you see a

58
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,400
little one here and then as that one

59
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,079
started to grow I would add the cover

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,730
crop a lot of people back then weren't

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,250
really showing that so that's how I was

62
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:34,530
able to start building a profile on mass

63
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,229
groups if you guys remember like Wiz

64
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,659
Khalifa little Wayne if you guys went to

65
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:41,549
that show this was my first its mass

66
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,829
roots photo that actually was featured

67
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,330
so when it on the platform there that

68
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,830
meant that pretty much every single

69
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,040
person would be able to see your photo

70
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,810
so in hindsight that kind of like gave

71
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,659
me that injection of social media at

72
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,430
work it felt good to open up that

73
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,870
platform and see you know a thousand

74
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,450
people liking your stuff

75
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,490
so unfortunately massroots ended up

76
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:05,729
getting shut down I believe they went

77
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:07,709
bankrupt and reported losses of forty

78
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,869
four million dollars so to run these

79
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,670
social media things that's huge

80
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,060
one thing that I did learn with the

81
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:17,069
massroots pro platform is that basically

82
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,979
I am building my house the same as you

83
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,629
guys on somebody else's land so remember

84
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,750
that if the littlest thing happens all

85
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:26,099
that work I mean I spent unfortunately I

86
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,349
couldn't get to my match roots account

87
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,329
but I had over 10,000 followers and that

88
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:33,090
took me about two years to build so that

89
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,209
was really two years waster for me the

90
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,340
next one that I learned about was

91
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,259
content creation again so I started

92
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,330
teaching myself about canva I was

93
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,819
showing out living so if you grow roots

94
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:47,730
a lot easier than synthetic salts and

95
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:52,680
this was my first viral content on that

96
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:54,389
platform unfortunately like I said

97
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,209
massroots got shut down so the next

98
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:59,129
thing to my attention was the doobie

99
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,060
platform any of you guys were on that

100
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:05,060
doobie platform as well ya know

101
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,069
on that one so I worked really hard to

102
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,020
do the same thing content creation kind

103
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:11,359
of the same stuff king same game plan

104
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:14,450
basically and I was able to build the

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,009
largest of following on that app over

106
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,529
49,000 followers

107
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,480
again unfortunately Dubey didn't really

108
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,299
understand the cannabis industry market

109
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,980
so they're kind of just showing girls

110
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,509
and bikinis and that kind of stuff and

111
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,150
there wasn't really any real breeders

112
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,469
any real growers on the platform and so

113
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:34,069
the interest started to die down

114
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,979
I think they and they lost their

115
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:39,500
following late August 2018 so just

116
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:47,509
pretty recently The Doobie start to fall

117
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:49,459
off as well all right so so then I

118
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:51,709
actually worked with this man right here

119
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:54,680
I'm having some other larger brands

120
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:56,209
around the state through massroots and

121
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,490
through doobie people started to see our

122
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:00,888
content and that's really when I wanted

123
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,220
to start giving back so we created our

124
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,300
first event it was on September 11th we

125
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,710
were trying to get a bunch of veterans

126
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,689
to come out for free

127
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:11,269
we had the blooper bus and we all adapt

128
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:14,300
and back then especially it was pretty

129
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:16,668
nostalgic everyone kind of enjoyed it

130
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,069
and I was hoping to move forward with

131
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:21,079
growing on that doobie app unfortunately

132
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:26,360
that it worked out for me so I started

133
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:28,250
teaching myself Instagram so this was my

134
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,780
Instagram at the time I was doing

135
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,569
basically the same thing that I was

136
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:33,619
doing on mass routes and doobie

137
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:35,300
unfortunately on Instagram there's so

138
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,490
many people on that platform that it's

139
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,020
hard to compete so I was working every

140
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,970
day the same way on mass rooms and

141
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,339
doobie and I was only able to build my

142
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,979
falling to about 2,000 followers so I

143
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:49,429
really started to focus on what improves

144
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:50,810
engagement so more showing more faces

145
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,590
showing more of the guys that I'm

146
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,990
hanging out which

147
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,819
the backend of things that you would

148
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,560
think are pretty mundane cut your grows

149
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:59,389
or your dispensaries that's actually

150
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,800
what people like to see on social media

151
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:02,209
especially in the Midwest back then

152
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,160
people really like to see us just

153
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:07,759
messing with plants learning how to grow

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,920
cannabis and so I kept the engagement

155
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,409
basically with these two things making

156
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,000
sure that I started to learn about

157
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,550
hashtags and then making sure that every

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,170
post that I made had a GU attack so that

159
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,420
would be like the same thing today if

160
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,390
you guys are taking photos making sure

161
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,040
that I said the Denver Mart or you can

162
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:27,139
also look up where it says Indo Expo

163
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,090
show and then that will actually geotag

164
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,800
right here where you are so a lot more

165
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,079
people will be able to see your content

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:39,470
just using more hashtags and just using

167
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:41,990
geo tags from there I really started to

168
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,880
dive into what it takes to build an

169
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,290
Instagram account and really that comes

170
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,509
back to the same way when you're trying

171
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:51,170
to build something like a website you

172
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:53,149
have to adhere by instagrams algorithm

173
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,970
so what I would basically do is I would

174
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,769
not created my profile right three or

175
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,960
three organic cannabis that is basically

176
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:01,490
like your email if you will you do never

177
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,469
you never really want to change that

178
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,210
because all those likes all those tags

179
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,190
that people have as soon as you change

180
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:09,709
that name all of that stuff disappears

181
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,850
so it's kind of like a musician or

182
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,789
something like that when you're on that

183
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,410
platform you never want to change that

184
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:18,439
you aren't able to change this this is

185
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,870
more for SEO so I like to use emojis

186
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,399
because most people when they look at

187
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,500
your profile they're not really going to

188
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,750
read everything they're gonna scan so

189
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,000
this sticks out when I like somebody's

190
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,740
photo you'll actually see my name and

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,750
then living soil cannabis underneath

192
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,620
that with a little brain so if you guys

193
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:39,560
have business accounts on Instagram this

194
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,629
is this is worth gold right here this is

195
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,660
how people find you so you want to have

196
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,829
something on there not your name like

197
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,810
reality most people don't know me as

198
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:49,279
Brian most people know me as 3 or 3

199
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,319
organic cannabis so it's kind of

200
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,059
pointless for me to put

201
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,469
name right here because nobody's going

202
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,740
to be looking for that but they are

203
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,360
looking for living soil cannabis then I

204
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,460
would once you sign up for a business

205
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,740
account you're able to use hashtags in

206
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:04,899
real time so this was who I was working

207
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,000
for back in the day and so I would just

208
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:10,209
kind of show people that I was using my

209
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,339
Instagram to educate I was using I was

210
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:14,289
living soil instructor at that time I

211
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:15,639
was working at Buffalo I was also

212
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,500
growing from green farms

213
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,289
I was also the communications director

214
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,209
for a Denver normal and then I was also

215
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:27,189
cross promoting back then on the Doobie

216
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:29,199
act then he would use your the URL that

217
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,719
you want to try to promote and back then

218
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,429
I had only spoken that mechanical Expo

219
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,399
so I'm proud to say that this is my

220
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:38,348
fourth time speaking at Indo Expo and I

221
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,598
can attribute most of this just from

222
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:45,009
this Instagram account so you really can

223
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,690
build brands just on Instagram all right

224
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,429
I wanted to so that was the first time

225
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,630
I've ever got a hundred likes so I don't

226
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,899
know if you guys have ever got that real

227
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:56,679
quick but it's over you're dealing I

228
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:58,240
feel like it's kind of coming keeps you

229
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,259
going forward when you start to realize

230
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,639
that people are starting to pay

231
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:03,909
attention to the content that you're

232
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:07,689
producing does anybody see anything

233
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:11,439
pretty weird or nostalgia or wise on

234
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:14,320
this infographic newspapers write

235
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,300
newspapers um I'm sure most of you guys

236
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,100
in here I'm a small-time guy I can't

237
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:20,799
compete with a Brandon spending seven

238
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,570
hundred nineteen dollars on that but the

239
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,039
one thing that you will not see yet is

240
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,200
there's nothing being spent on social

241
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,389
media at least on Instagram Facebook

242
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,060
you're not even allowed to so that

243
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:33,069
allows us our small time guys to start

244
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:34,689
to compete with these bigger brands by

245
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,230
just putting in the work on these social

246
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:41,070
media platforms I would imagine as we go

247
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,450
nationwide for legalization that

248
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,340
Instagram Facebook will begin to allow

249
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,990
you guys to spend money and promote your

250
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,149
posts but at this time you're not

251
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,060
allowed to so that gives us that even

252
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:54,559
playing field right

253
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:57,139
with a small-time guy Instagram and

254
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,659
Facebook although Facebook Osnes owns

255
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:03,110
Instagram they're vastly different

256
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:05,209
platforms so what would work on Facebook

257
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,159
is not going to work on Instagram and in

258
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,330
my opinion for cannabis Facebook is

259
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,240
starting to die off

260
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:13,340
there's about you know there's about 1

261
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,259
million people actively every month on

262
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,420
Instagram and that's actually obviously

263
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:20,740
a huge place to start to build your

264
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:23,059
profiles start to get that word out

265
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,460
Instagram because growth is going at 5

266
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:28,129
percent per quarter and then Facebook is

267
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,840
only a three snapchat at two so you can

268
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,580
see that this is where the growth is

269
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,050
going well if you're gonna spend your

270
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,940
time and I know a lot of you guys are

271
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:37,219
probably also farmers you don't have a

272
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,950
lot of time I start to just focus on

273
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,660
that one platform and for me everything

274
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,700
has come from Instagram even though I

275
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:45,230
have been off massroots and I happened

276
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,170
on do be the only time I've actually

277
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:53,899
made monetary gains in my life is from

278
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:55,549
Instagram so the platform data is really

279
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:57,350
starting to come through if you're

280
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:59,959
posting things on Facebook and Instagram

281
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,180
you're going to see 23% less engagement

282
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,240
on Facebook than you would with the same

283
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:06,859
photo on Instagram there's brands that

284
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,710
are on Facebook that are promoting and

285
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,850
they've seen 10 times less engagement on

286
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,889
that platform

287
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,720
compared to Instagram so it's not just

288
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:17,000
me saying this that data is also

289
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,470
starting to show that the majority of

290
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,840
people are starting to move towards mr.

291
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,460
day and then of course that engagement

292
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:28,700
on platform is 0.09% Twitter 0.40

293
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,950
I'm sorry 2004 8% and then this is

294
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,980
actually pretty impressive for the

295
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,900
entire platform 1.6 percent engagement I

296
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,210
don't know if you guys really understand

297
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,309
those numbers but that is huge for a app

298
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,290
that means there's a lot of people of

299
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:44,029
that billion people they're checking in

300
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:45,949
every day looking at their Instagram

301
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:51,079
feed and that's what we want we want

302
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,340
eyeballs on our content so Instagram was

303
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,639
bought by Facebook

304
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,620
April 9th 2012 for a billion dollars and

305
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,818
they actually reached that billion

306
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,989
monthly

307
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:04,128
subscribe our users on June 20th 2018 so

308
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:06,679
it really hasn't been that many years

309
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:09,918
until everybody started to flocking

310
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:12,470
towards Instagram Instagram made six

311
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:14,720
point one eight billion dollars and 2018

312
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,359
they made nine point oh eight billion

313
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,519
dollars in 2019 and they're projected to

314
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:22,220
make twelve point three two billion

315
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,808
dollars in 2020 so you can tell that

316
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,278
with that amount of money that they're

317
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:27,438
starting to make that you continue to

318
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,538
improve the platform and where big money

319
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:31,458
is that's how you know that they're not

320
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:32,688
gonna fall to the wayside like some of

321
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:36,948
these other apps that I've been talking

322
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:40,129
about here who here understands

323
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:42,409
influencer marketing right so basically

324
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:44,389
what that is is somebody has a large

325
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:46,728
profile usually those are like Instagram

326
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,879
models and they take a photo of a

327
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:53,449
product snap it and then this company

328
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:55,069
would pay them for doing that when a lot

329
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:57,349
of those influencer influential

330
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:59,659
marketing campaigns where asked which

331
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,699
platforms you like to use seventy nine

332
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:08,389
or seventy three seventy nine percent of

333
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:10,068
the people chose Instagram so I really

334
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,350
don't want to keep harping on this but

335
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:15,259
the data and everything is showing that

336
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,689
the entire movement is moving away from

337
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:23,449
anything really but Instagram maybe a

338
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:25,938
little bit of tik-tok as well so these

339
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:28,368
are brands that are actually built on

340
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,958
the Instagram platform solely on

341
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:33,439
influencer marking and I would imagine

342
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:36,138
most ladies know this crap you guys

343
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,308
ladies are part of this and then if

344
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:40,818
you're a workout guy

345
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:42,198
workout lady bang energy drinks so if

346
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:46,338
you'll notice they kind of do the same

347
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:48,078
setup all big brands will use emojis and

348
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:51,799
then they're trying to get you to go to

349
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,808
something on their year or URL no matter

350
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:55,458
what brands you are whether you're got a

351
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:58,278
hundred million followers or you have a

352
00:13:55,458 --> 00:14:00,288
thousand followers you get one link so

353
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:02,720
the goal is to try to get people to

354
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:05,389
start to learn more about you using that

355
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,820
URL fashion OVA choose

356
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:09,799
this post probably five six times a day

357
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,560
really getting their content out there

358
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:15,199
where Bank Energy probably posts just a

359
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,849
few times so you guys can see that you

360
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,030
know you start posting more times per

361
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,350
day if you're able to do that the more

362
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:28,850
following and you're going to start to

363
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:32,180
achieve so last year 95 million photos

364
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,950
were shared per day on Instagram 1

365
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:35,419
billion of those people were on the

366
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,060
platform every single day

367
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:42,559
500 million stories are being shared

368
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:45,049
every single day 63% of Instagram users

369
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,579
log on at least once a day and this is

370
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:49,849
the metric that everyone should care

371
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,950
about most people are on the entire

372
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,379
platform are on there for at least 28

373
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,200
minutes a day this is huge compared to

374
00:14:54,379 --> 00:15:02,330
any other platform so that's why I keep

375
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,790
my focus on Instagram so instagrams goal

376
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,370
is really to keep you addicted to their

377
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:11,299
platform they want that 28 minutes to go

378
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,889
up to 32 then to 36 as time goes on one

379
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:15,139
of the easiest ways for them to do that

380
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:17,090
is to create certain things like this

381
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:19,490
Instagram stories is basically like

382
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,769
snapchat so they continue to improve

383
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,990
their platform to steal a lot of that

384
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:26,480
traffic that's going on to the other

385
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,279
platforms and I imagine in 2020

386
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,440
Instagram is going to continue to do

387
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,209
these things the problem is is that

388
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,460
cannabis is really not allowed on

389
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,780
Instagram so even if you are creating

390
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,870
fantastic content

391
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,509
none of our stuff as far as late 2019

392
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,580
and now in the 20 20 goes on the explore

393
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:45,710
page and that's really how you build

394
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,090
your account on Instagram so we have to

395
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,030
think through these things to try to

396
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,950
find ways for us to work together to try

397
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:54,110
to help promote each other stuff so

398
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,450
that's why we tagged each other in the

399
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,610
stories hopefully you can start tagging

400
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,680
more of your friends in the actual daily

401
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,950
posts because none of our stuff is

402
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:06,589
hitting that Explorer page and this is

403
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,990
carousel was created last year and this

404
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,700
goal is for every single in your post

405
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,799
instead of them when you're going

406
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,340
through your feet you see that one photo

407
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,949
now that carousel

408
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,960
to keep more people on the platform so

409
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,570
you're able to post up to ten photos on

410
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,960
that carousel and that's really where I

411
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:27,900
feel like the next the next breakthrough

412
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,060
is for us as canvas farmers to start to

413
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,519
show as many photos as we can to try to

414
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:34,199
continue to fill that engagement with

415
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,169
all of the negative things that are

416
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,120
happening with Instagram and Facebook

417
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:41,759
has anybody had their account deleted on

418
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,950
Facebook Instagram yeah so you guys know

419
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,389
how it is hardening that is my account

420
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,339
is taking me over three and a half years

421
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:50,429
to build so if they deleted that

422
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,620
tomorrow to be honest I don't know where

423
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:54,028
it would be because Instagram really is

424
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,570
building up everything that I'm doing

425
00:16:54,028 --> 00:17:00,360
business-wise branding wise so it's it's

426
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,760
really it's really important to stay

427
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,799
focused on making sure that you guys

428
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,609
understand how the algorithm works and

429
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,930
that's what I'm gonna teach you guys

430
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:12,359
today so the youth is basically the ones

431
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,799
that are on the platform itself these

432
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:18,359
numbers I've actually started to climb

433
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:20,669
late in 2019 so as you guys can see this

434
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:25,409
stuff isn't going away it's only being

435
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:28,679
consumed more and more does anybody know

436
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:31,920
what this is everybody knows your Kylie

437
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,570
Jenner as I'm sure all right so then I

438
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,519
would say the majority of the internet

439
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:37,529
really doesn't like the Kardashians so

440
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,579
somebody came up with a way to beat her

441
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:43,980
top photo that was done in 2018 of her

442
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:45,599
daughter stormy so they just posted an A

443
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,210
and so that they wanted to break the

444
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,889
world record please like this age and I

445
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,140
like this slide because it kind of shows

446
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,060
the power of Instagram we're trying to

447
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,009
do this on obviously a microcosm scale

448
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:58,500
but if your entire cannabis community

449
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:00,990
gets behind you your stuff can also kind

450
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,269
of go viral like this so as to date

451
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,420
we're close to fifty three million likes

452
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:08,309
just on an egg so I would hope that you

453
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,470
guys really start to see there really is

454
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,169
power behind this once those accounts

455
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,278
start to grow and I would give a tip of

456
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,619
the hat to come

457
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:18,690
called 7/10 labs here in Denver those

458
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:20,939
guys really understand social media and

459
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,320
their stuff is still trying to go there

460
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,788
a lot of their stuff still goes viral

461
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,739
and that's because they have such a

462
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:26,908
strong following and you really have to

463
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,769
admire that

464
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:30,509
in this day and age to try to fill that

465
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,519
stuff up they have quality products I

466
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,618
have nothing to do with 7/10 apps but I

467
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,108
just admire their work everything that

468
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:39,418
they're doing from product creation to

469
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:41,668
social media to being around in the

470
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:44,519
community is the reason why they're able

471
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:45,629
to combat some of these negative things

472
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:50,069
that have been happening to a lot of

473
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:51,988
these cannabis accounts so last year I

474
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:54,468
was approached by a marketing company

475
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:57,538
that told me that they could improve my

476
00:18:54,469 --> 00:19:00,570
Instagram account and I sat down in a

477
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:02,219
meeting with a few of their few of the

478
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:04,378
people in that marketing firm and they

479
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:05,700
talked about follow for follow and all

480
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:07,579
these kind of like silly things that

481
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,719
don't even really work anymore

482
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,668
fortunately for me I started to find out

483
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:13,710
the day I actually knew more about

484
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:16,349
Instagram than this marketing company

485
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,749
but I asked them please to not add fake

486
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:20,158
followers please I don't need fake likes

487
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:22,399
that kind of stuff and they assured me

488
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,989
that that wasn't going to happen

489
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:27,658
unfortunately for me that's exactly what

490
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:29,759
did happen I almost lost my Instagram

491
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,778
account last year so I feel for a few

492
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,348
those people that raised their hand

493
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:37,618
before this is a nightmare

494
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:39,388
for a cannabis Instagram account so

495
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:42,329
basically what had happened was I gave

496
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:44,878
my password and my username to that

497
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:47,699
marketing firm they then outsource that

498
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:49,648
to a third party and all around the

499
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,348
world people started to log into my

500
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:54,118
Instagram account which means I don't

501
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:56,668
know how you guys feel but that's almost

502
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:58,378
like like maybe not as extreme to a bank

503
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,210
account but it's pretty close especially

504
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:02,158
if you've worked that hard to try to

505
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,469
build that Instagram up so now everybody

506
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,320
has my banking information for Instagram

507
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:09,179
and again a lot of this stuff I took I

508
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,689
took these three but there was a lot

509
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:14,729
more log in not only attempts but actual

510
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,870
logins that where people were successful

511
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:18,789
so if somebody was a militia

512
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:23,219
they kind of deleted my entire mount and

513
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:23,220
I have no control over that whatsoever I

514
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:29,259
hate this okay so this is basically what

515
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,808
they started to do they started spamming

516
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:33,910
in my DMS which by the way Instagram

517
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:36,160
watches that stuff so back in the day

518
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,140
I'm sure some of us used to hey man can

519
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,509
I get a couple pounds and then and the

520
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,730
DM that kind of stuff that all the

521
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:44,769
Instagram algorithm watches all of that

522
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,180
now so a lot of those seed breeders out

523
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:47,980
there that keep getting their accounts

524
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,570
deleted I can assure them it's because

525
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,210
they're doing business within that

526
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:53,859
direct message so if they stopped doing

527
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,900
that a lot of their accounts will stop

528
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:58,058
being tweeted so if you guys aren't

529
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,340
talking business that kind of stuff

530
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:02,379
within that direct message there's a

531
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:04,750
chance that you are going to get deleted

532
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,850
and of course if you're spamming people

533
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,160
which they are doing this to thousands

534
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:11,199
of people right so basically what

535
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,970
they're doing is hey my name is Brian I

536
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,279
work with living soil solutions I'd love

537
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,750
to connect with you sometime thousands

538
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,389
and thousands and thousands of times

539
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,339
every single week some people obviously

540
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,470
get annoyed with that so somebody hacked

541
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:26,019
into my account and changed everything

542
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,269
again this is a nightmare situation for

543
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:31,210
me I have no idea what language this is

544
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:33,490
I had no idea what they had done so it

545
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:36,700
took me weeks to try to get my Instagram

546
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,710
account credentials back which so

547
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,940
obviously slows down branding or all of

548
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:45,400
those things and then the dreaded dead

549
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,259
followers ghosts followers these are the

550
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,929
kind of people that started following me

551
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:52,299
so my account jumped up right and they

552
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:54,160
were I would go into those meetings they

553
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:55,720
say oh look look at how many followers

554
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,880
you have now I'm not sure if you guys

555
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,650
understand how that the algorithm at

556
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,620
least works now from twenty nineteen and

557
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,840
twenty to twenty twenty but about seven

558
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:06,519
to ten percent of your followers are

559
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,859
gonna see your content when you first

560
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:11,079
post and then those followers are going

561
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:12,189
to dictate if they like that stuff that

562
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,710
they're engaging I've been making

563
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,769
comments are they sending in to other

564
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,470
people if that is happening then those

565
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:23,109
photos go on to the next round of your

566
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,980
followers and your content tends to grow

567
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:27,199
sometimes virally that way

568
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,420
but it's all up to those followers so if

569
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,029
I have a bunch of ghost followers when

570
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,050
I'm posting my posts are literally going

571
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:35,539
into the ether

572
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:38,569
there's nobody seeing that content so to

573
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:43,029
cheat the system in 2019 2020 on

574
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:45,769
Instagram was foolish maybe when we like

575
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:48,799
2008-2009 when a lot of that automation

576
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:50,839
stuff would work a lot of people would

577
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,669
you could kind of you could kind of talk

578
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:54,259
back in Vegas there'd be 50,000

579
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,990
followers with a hundred likes on a

580
00:22:54,259 --> 00:23:01,039
photo that's a fake right that's a fake

581
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,870
account and in my in my opinion that's

582
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,460
basically like not having account no

583
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:07,729
one's going to engage that people think

584
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,559
it's silly so I encourage you guys that

585
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,849
if you do have a bunch of ghost

586
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,230
followers this kind of stuff where they

587
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,359
don't need to take the time to post a

588
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:18,009
photo you can go within your Instagram

589
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:23,419
account and start to remove those people

590
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:25,640
and then this is basically Instagram on

591
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,350
the front porch me on their lawn pumping

592
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,970
that shotgun saying if you continue to

593
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:30,889
do this we are going to delete your

594
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:35,329
account and this just happened to me

595
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:37,160
just a few months ago so I I can't

596
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:39,079
express enough why this is so

597
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,670
disheartening is because I have to work

598
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:43,549
on my Instagram to throw it the way that

599
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,950
I have organically every single day so

600
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:55,609
to have that deleted would be

601
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:59,090
heartbreaking so basically once this

602
00:23:55,609 --> 00:24:00,769
once this comes out I have probably

603
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:04,099
about a week to two weeks to change

604
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:05,750
things so I have to make sure that any

605
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:08,389
kind of program that I've ever logged in

606
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,039
before any kind of third-party app that

607
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,040
is associated with my Instagram I have

608
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:15,049
to make sure that I log out of that and

609
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,450
delete that from my actual phone itself

610
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:19,430
or Instagram is going to continue to

611
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:23,200
notice that if I did nothing here they

612
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:27,870
would have deleted my account and just

613
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,730
recently this is basically

614
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:33,489
what is that ninety basically almost a

615
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,649
month ago I got this message and this

616
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,599
comes from still people that do follow

617
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:40,048
me sometimes they'll go through the feed

618
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,879
and like a lot of photos real quickly

619
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:45,220
Instagram sees that as a automation

620
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,890
technique and they actually shut down my

621
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,419
account for him for a week every single

622
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,929
day I would tell them that this was a

623
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,090
mistake

624
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:56,169
and I still wasn't able to log into my

625
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:58,209
account alright so this is kind of the

626
00:24:56,169 --> 00:25:00,509
bread and butter this is what I want to

627
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,340
teach you guys today this is the way to

628
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:05,308
build your organically build your

629
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:08,230
Instagram account I may not have that

630
00:25:05,308 --> 00:25:11,079
22,000 followers that the marketing

631
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,899
companies touted as a good thing but I

632
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:15,369
do have real followers so when I first

633
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:18,278
started out again I make sure that this

634
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:19,869
is up here this is the metric that most

635
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:22,929
of you to have a business account really

636
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:24,879
should care about is that how many

637
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:27,250
people are coming to your profile every

638
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,630
single week my goal with the amount of

639
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,859
followers that I have is to try to get

640
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:35,169
that up to a thousand every single week

641
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:37,509
if you notice I have a lower post

642
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:39,250
profile so if there's something that

643
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:41,500
really didn't do well or maybe it's an

644
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:44,259
older post that had you know 34 likes

645
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,148
two years ago I'll just delete that post

646
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:50,190
because everything comes down to this

647
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:53,019
algorithm the more followers that I have

648
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,240
the better the algorithm looks and the

649
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:57,759
less people that I'm following so a lot

650
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,278
of facebook you kind of use follow for

651
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,140
follow if you're friends with somebody

652
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,298
they follow you you follow them back but

653
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,809
on Instagram that algorithms really

654
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:09,940
looks at that so if no one's posting on

655
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:12,069
the people that you're following that's

656
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,380
again just the ghost account that's if

657
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:16,210
it's worthless so there's no reason to

658
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,799
follow people unless they're posting I

659
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,329
would say at least once a week

660
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:22,960
that they're posting even once a month

661
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:26,648
it's pointless to follow them I changed

662
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,630
my category to entrepreneur and that

663
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:30,759
seemed to also boost my following as

664
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,770
well when I changed it from just it's at

665
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,359
college and university so whatever you

666
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:35,200
guys find some people like to put public

667
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,418
figure

668
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,970
some people later I would imagine a lot

669
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:42,610
of people would like to put entrepreneur

670
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,620
sometime a brand or business but this is

671
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:46,689
another way that the algorithm finds

672
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:48,759
your account so not only am I an

673
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,038
entrepreneur but I'm a living soil

674
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:54,099
cannabis entrepreneurs and that's the

675
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,319
way the algorithm sees that I've been

676
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:59,709
rep Sun leaf seed and Dominion seed

677
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,970
company Duke diamond and Derek they're

678
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,649
actually out there today if you guys

679
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,319
want to check out their their seeds and

680
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:06,819
stuff but it's brands that I admire and

681
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,408
so I put that at the top of the list

682
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:11,769
because I want people to know that these

683
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:13,330
are the people that I'm associated with

684
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:18,148
a business account you're able to then

685
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:22,509
have touch hashtags and touch applicants

686
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:24,879
so I'm able to show off that not only do

687
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:27,609
I work hand in hand with seed companies

688
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,679
I am a public speaker and I also spoke

689
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:32,740
around the country at these places and

690
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,288
hats off to Shango most because I also

691
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,929
in Portland gave a talk on leaving soil

692
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:39,190
that is kind of gone pretty well I would

693
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:41,440
say on that Club I think I think we're

694
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,000
over twenty thousand watches yeah so

695
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,730
that's another way that you can continue

696
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,450
to build your platform through Instagram

697
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:51,730
is by code promoting so I try to get an

698
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,159
action item so I show a little video

699
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,990
with a finger pointing down again this

700
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,990
is a living soil video and then this

701
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:01,179
goes to shengo's youtube so it's really

702
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,250
easy for anybody that finds out about me

703
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,440
to find out more about me and I try to

704
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,788
make that as easy as possible I then

705
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,419
have little highlights of what I've done

706
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:17,048
throughout the the week and then of

707
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:19,028
course my posts so for 2020 this is kind

708
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:21,339
of the way that Instagram wants you to

709
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:23,138
start doing hashtags and tagging people

710
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:26,699
where you're actually writing it in the

711
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:29,469
context of what you're saying in that

712
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,649
text bar so instead of just you know

713
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,929
these are the same same photos this is a

714
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:35,969
gentleman and Oklahoma I thought it was

715
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:37,350
funny so I

716
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,420
I reposted it I don't know if you guys

717
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:42,119
have been out to Oklahoma but especially

718
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,230
this time last year this was the kind of

719
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:45,119
stuff that a lot of these guys were

720
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,319
throwing so I thought I was funny made a

721
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,219
little meme

722
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:53,819
this gentleman has very little on here

723
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:56,970
just a few hashtags every single hashtag

724
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:59,129
that you have is going to go to that to

725
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,440
that main platform so if I have organic

726
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,180
cannabis and you click on that hashtag

727
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,029
it goes to all those organic cannabis

728
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,130
photos as soon as this is posted that's

729
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:10,680
going to go to the most recent but my

730
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,410
goal is to get seen your goal is to get

731
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,850
seen so you're using those hashtags but

732
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,519
you want to try to find hashtags that

733
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:19,859
you can rank for because they haven't

734
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,900
what's called top post top nine if you

735
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:24,149
can get one of your post to be in that

736
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,160
top nine sometimes that will last for

737
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:30,090
years and then that's really how people

738
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,279
start to find you so I write this out I

739
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:35,129
tagged two people that are with I start

740
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:37,289
to look up and research hashtags that I

741
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,450
feel like I can rank for I give credit

742
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:41,549
because this obviously isn't my photo I

743
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:45,299
give shoutouts to people that I admire

744
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:48,240
over the years and as you guys can see I

745
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:55,019
get way more engagement by doing it this

746
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:57,299
way so hashtags is really the basis of

747
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:58,859
Instagram and this is where you guys

748
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:01,079
really need to take the time to start to

749
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,719
do the research I would say start off

750
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,849
with 10 at a time so I would research 10

751
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,559
hashtags for that week find out what

752
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:09,869
they are all you really need to do is go

753
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:14,039
into your Instagram it's a little search

754
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:16,169
icon type in a organic cannabis hit that

755
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:20,670
tag and all of those photos especially

756
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:22,380
that top 9 will pop up so it'll show you

757
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,000
like if you hit cannabis right now I

758
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,510
guarantee it's still at twenty point

759
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,579
four million tags so when we make a post

760
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:30,230
what you want to do is try to get a

761
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,899
little bit

762
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,509
these larger hashtags so I know when I

763
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,580
make a post most of these hashtags might

764
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:39,319
last 15 minutes where people are singing

765
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:41,689
it because so many people are using that

766
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:44,418
hashtag that it gets lost in the feed

767
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,580
but at the same time 15 minutes on a

768
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:48,860
large hashtag like that you might get up

769
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:50,418
and reflects if it's quality photo then

770
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:52,789
I go down and I try to do like the

771
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:55,130
medium-sized stuff so these hashtags

772
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:58,970
when I make a post would probably last

773
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,290
maybe 15 20 minutes 30 minutes depending

774
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,950
on how many people are on the platform

775
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:06,589
for that day and then I do more like a

776
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:09,890
niche type stuff that is relevant to me

777
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:11,389
so I'm really big on quality we we kind

778
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,640
of jumped on the bandwagon of a girl

779
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:17,030
like a pro and then these two tags I

780
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:20,570
obviously create so if you have a brand

781
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:22,609
create something that that is relevant

782
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:24,500
to you it doesn't even really matter if

783
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:26,209
a lot of people see that because not

784
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,849
many people are using living soil

785
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:30,230
solutions hashtag but if they do go and

786
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:33,469
click that they're going to see all of

787
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,599
my posts or my business partners posts

788
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:38,269
so it's really important to make sure

789
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:41,029
that you guys use a few that go out and

790
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:42,470
then all the way up to the top where

791
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:47,210
there's millions of people looking at

792
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:50,539
that on a daily basis Instagram stories

793
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:53,600
you guys using Instagram stories this is

794
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:55,418
kind of the new frontier if you're not

795
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,798
seeing a lot of action on your posts I

796
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:59,540
assure you if you do have a quality

797
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:01,279
following you'll see a lot of action on

798
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:03,139
your stories a lot of people don't even

799
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,819
want to scroll through the feed anymore

800
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,770
they just want to sit there and hold

801
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:09,529
their phone and sit there and watch the

802
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:11,569
stories scroll so I encourage you guys

803
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:13,519
this is more of like the daily kind of

804
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:16,039
stuff so if you're just daily here at

805
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,900
the end of Expo show take a quick photo

806
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,069
put that in your stories if it's

807
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,509
something that you know you haven't seen

808
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,829
a buddy in a long time and you're making

809
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:23,900
a photo and you want something to be

810
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:26,509
permanent then that's what I would post

811
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:31,440
up in your actual post fee where people

812
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:34,749
will see that usually for years to come

813
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,929
and Instagram stories is a little bit

814
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:40,209
different than just your normal hashtags

815
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:42,909
Instagram stories only last with 24

816
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:46,659
hours so our goal is to go big so we

817
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:49,028
never want to use niche type hashtags

818
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:51,129
unless we're at a like an in each type

819
00:32:49,028 --> 00:32:53,709
of thing otherwise you want to use these

820
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:56,228
larger hashtags so if you're doing

821
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:58,778
something with cannabis like obviously a

822
00:32:56,229 --> 00:33:01,749
4/20 sticky hashtag it's going to be a

823
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:03,878
lot pop a lot more popular than just my

824
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:05,379
living soil solutions now many people

825
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:08,759
are going to see that and then again it

826
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:08,759
only lasts for 24 hours

827
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:19,298
so who's heard of Gary beep like I

828
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:21,458
crushed it so this really is the secret

829
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:23,979
of how I've been able to organically

830
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:27,009
build my Instagram from 4,000 followers

831
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:29,409
to 17,000 followers with no gimmicks and

832
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:31,838
it's the dollar 80 principle so

833
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:35,229
basically what I do is I go around and I

834
00:33:31,838 --> 00:33:38,708
put my two cents in on these top nine

835
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:41,409
photos for these 10 hashtags that I've

836
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:43,929
just done research on so every day I'm

837
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:47,169
putting my two cents in on those top

838
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:50,709
nine and then that's what I allows me to

839
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:53,528
get to that dollar 80 so this stuff

840
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:56,589
usually takes probably an hour or two of

841
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:59,618
my time every single day there really is

842
00:33:56,588 --> 00:34:01,479
no secret there's no automation anymore

843
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:03,458
that's kind of like going to the gym you

844
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:06,009
they put in the work and you do this

845
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:08,108
formula you will see your Instagram grow

846
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:10,119
I guarantee you and if you stick with

847
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:11,918
this stuff for 90 days I assure you

848
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:13,659
you're going to start getting hundreds

849
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,818
of sometimes thousands of followers a

850
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:18,250
week because you're posting your two

851
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:20,168
cents on those top nine photos and

852
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,869
sometimes those top nine photos will

853
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:25,898
last for years so sometimes I'll put

854
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:28,659
like hey check out organic Canada 3 or 3

855
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:31,268
organic cannabis I'm repping suddenly

856
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,889
seeds at Indo Expo and out and I'll post

857
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:33,908
that or if there's somebody that makes

858
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,659
like a really good photo

859
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,559
hey great photo somebody's been working

860
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,929
out that kind of stuff

861
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:43,269
hey man swole that kind of stuff so

862
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,220
you're really trying to engage with your

863
00:34:43,268 --> 00:34:48,358
audience without making it come off as

864
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:55,568
spam does everybody kind of get how this

865
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:59,409
yeah and then this is it in real time so

866
00:34:55,568 --> 00:35:01,480
I just click on organic marijuana these

867
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:03,899
are the top posts for that hashtag and

868
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:11,769
then I just go through those top nine

869
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:14,460
start to scroll down like the photo add

870
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:14,459
a comment

871
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,039
and I do that for all top nine and I do

872
00:35:20,858 --> 00:35:27,369
that for ten hashtags every single day

873
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:29,799
and I promise you stick with that for 90

874
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:34,358
days and your account will explode but

875
00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:37,059
there is no sort of shortcut so I see

876
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:39,848
another gentleman I I agreed with that

877
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:44,528
little meme hashtag to make sure that

878
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:46,930
the account owner sees it and then I

879
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:48,429
just keep it moving i if I'm following

880
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:50,379
someone I make sure that I go through

881
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:53,440
and I like every single one of their

882
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,358
photos for that day I'm not one of these

883
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,108
guys that I don't like that photo so I'm

884
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:58,538
not gonna like it

885
00:35:56,108 --> 00:36:00,278
my goal is to build a brand on this to

886
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:02,770
Graham so all the people that I follow

887
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:04,869
already I like them so I'm going to give

888
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:07,179
them a like every time that I do put a

889
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,829
like on their photo it pops up three or

890
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:11,769
three organic cannabis like this photo

891
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:13,420
so that means that when people that are

892
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:16,150
also following me when they see that

893
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,740
same photo they're able to also see that

894
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:22,510
three or three organic cannabis like

895
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:26,038
that photo there's some more stuff from

896
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,039
Indo Expo last year

897
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,909
so like some of my friends here right

898
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,829
they also like that photo and that's why

899
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:39,568
anybody that I'm following I make sure

900
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:41,490
that I like their photo as best as I can

901
00:36:39,568 --> 00:36:45,119
and try to keep up that several times a

902
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:48,328
day because this is also brandy people

903
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,550
you know if you get 863 likes on a photo

904
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:51,990
that probably means you know double that

905
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:55,109
amount of people actually probably saw

906
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:57,598
that photo so it's a good metric for me

907
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:59,068
to be able to gauge how people like my

908
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,859
content whether they didn't like that

909
00:36:59,068 --> 00:37:06,059
content and then this is my these are

910
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:09,000
the amount of followers that I've

911
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:11,849
actually gotten in real time again I've

912
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,099
been shadow band last year does anybody

913
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:16,349
know what that means

914
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:19,200
so shadow banning is when I'm using my

915
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:22,079
hashtags and it it's not showing up in

916
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,358
that hashtag feed so I put organic

917
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,068
cannabis click on that it doesn't show

918
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:28,409
up in that hashtag that's what's known

919
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:31,199
as shadow band that's how they punish

920
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:33,358
you if you will for not doing what

921
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,629
instagrams asking and I got punished

922
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:40,710
pretty heavily with this because I was

923
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:43,260
using automation software if this sounds

924
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,970
too daunting for you guys especially I

925
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,800
mean it really is an hour and a half to

926
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:48,480
two hours every single day of going

927
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,210
through and lighting stuff on Instagram

928
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,309
to be able to build your profile my

929
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,730
opinion is then focused on LinkedIn I

930
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:58,949
think this is going to be huge for 2020

931
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:01,740
and beyond and it's very easy to gain

932
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:04,529
traction I love you guys on LinkedIn as

933
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:06,179
well yeah it's pretty confusing though

934
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,640
right I mean you kind of look through

935
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:10,828
there and there's there's still kind of

936
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,920
a lot of spam stuff but you guys know

937
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:16,318
who owns LinkedIn

938
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,269
nobody Microsoft Microsoft clones

939
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:20,639
LinkedIn so there's deep money behind

940
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:21,920
this so that's another platform that's

941
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,420
not gonna fail like

942
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,430
foods would like to be that's gonna run

943
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,010
out of money so I would put my time and

944
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:29,480
attention to some of these that you know

945
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,030
we're gonna stick around for a long time

946
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,039
and there's not really that many people

947
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,900
that engaged on LinkedIn so it's a lot

948
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:37,548
easier to start to build that brand I

949
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:45,318
would go brand with that kind of stuff

950
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:47,539
and show people your other profiles then

951
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:49,068
they at the end of the day my goal is to

952
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:50,329
give people whether they look me up by

953
00:38:49,068 --> 00:38:53,630
my name Brian Waksman

954
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:56,089
or by my Instagram handle that a lot of

955
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:58,640
things start to pop up on on the Google

956
00:38:56,088 --> 00:39:00,409
search engines now if you have a website

957
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,210
usually you have to hire somebody that

958
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:05,029
really understands SEO to start to get

959
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:07,010
to the top of that but a hat would be if

960
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,019
you can start to improve your social

961
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:11,030
media profiles Google loves those

962
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:13,009
profiles especially YouTube that kind of

963
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:16,010
stuff cuz they own that platform so

964
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:19,430
they'll put your information at the top

965
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:21,799
of that that the top 10 search speed and

966
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:23,779
that's really where anybody at least a

967
00:39:21,798 --> 00:39:25,940
nowadays seems to go if you're not in

968
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:28,460
that top 10 most people don't go to the

969
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,659
page 2 page 3 and the easiest way to get

970
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:34,670
to that top 10 is through social media

971
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:35,808
so I left this open because I really

972
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:40,389
like to engage with you guys on

973
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:40,390
questions so guys have a few questions

974
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:50,960
so I think tick tock is is going to be

975
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:53,150
huge right now it's kind of gimmicky and

976
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,550
it's young but I definitely feel like

977
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:57,650
it's going to here to stay so that is

978
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,240
probably something you know probably

979
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,130
this year I'll start to research and

980
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:03,319
learn on my own but right now I just

981
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:09,950
don't have enough knowledge uptick talk

982
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:12,680
to send a help anyone right now I have a

983
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:14,659
couple questions you said that cannabis

984
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:15,589
and devils not allowed on Instagram are

985
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:18,649
you talking about

986
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:21,140
sales of canvas micarta is the cannabis

987
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,389
products Instagram will not allow you to

988
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:25,219
pay to promote and that's really how a

989
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:26,900
lot of these marketing companies get by

990
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:29,929
with stuff so if I was selling teapots

991
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,690
right I can pay to have those teapots

992
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:36,049
promoted on that platform but because

993
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:38,480
cannabis is federally legal they will

994
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,280
not allow you to promote so right now

995
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,380
all of us are on the same playing field

996
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,350
is some of these large brands and this

997
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,700
is that small little window that some of

998
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:48,710
you guys can continue to build your

999
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:50,509
brand's that's why I was shown that

1000
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,670
infographic how much money is really

1001
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:55,340
starting to be spent on advertising

1002
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:57,590
cannabis none of that money can be spent

1003
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,600
on these social media platforms at this

1004
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:04,100
time but you're also you changed just a

1005
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:06,519
plant mark up for people to sell lights

1006
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:09,259
or supporting products or containers

1007
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:11,059
it's just there's some brands that can

1008
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,680
get away with that but if you're using

1009
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:14,059
the hashtag cannabis or something like

1010
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,250
that the algorithm is going to

1011
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:19,250
eventually see that okay then you said

1012
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,710
the 7:10 lab guys were super rad across

1013
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:25,579
the having a great page so I go to the

1014
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:29,300
opening a 220,000 likes or followers but

1015
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:32,059
their pages private so some people

1016
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,740
believe that Instagram isn't going to

1017
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:34,489
delete your account if you keep it

1018
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:36,759
private

1019
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:38,409
they have such a following in such a

1020
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,570
known

1021
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:42,609
around the country that they're able to

1022
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:44,710
do that in my opinion if you're a

1023
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,690
business especially a cannabis business

1024
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,760
there it's silly to keep your profile

1025
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,380
private because no one's going to be

1026
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,750
able to see that unless you already have

1027
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,240
that brand but for most of us in this

1028
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,340
room we're trying to build that brand so

1029
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:15,909
if we keep that profile private no one's

1030
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:19,269
going to see that's going to probably

1031
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:23,049
end a bunion book knows no pricing

1032
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:25,590
whatsoever more questions I know you got

1033
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,590
on the train

1034
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:38,739
yes sir the the algorithm likes it when

1035
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,260
you physically hit that button so I

1036
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:43,750
would honestly I would move away from

1037
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,740
anything automated especially for 2020

1038
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:48,400
and Instagram hates automation because

1039
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:49,839
especially on these third party

1040
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,150
platforms you guys are spending money

1041
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,070
with them eventually they want us to

1042
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:55,329
spend money on their platform so that's

1043
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,830
why they're not allowing us to be on

1044
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:58,239
that explore page and that kind of stuff

1045
00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:00,369
because they really want us to do it

1046
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:03,359
correctly or you're gonna get hammered

1047
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,359
like I did last year

1048
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:17,889
HootSuite was cool like five years ago

1049
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:20,619
that's anything automated really is

1050
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:21,849
dying off even with the influencer

1051
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:22,509
marketing that I was talking about from

1052
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,250
before right

1053
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,200
Instagram hates influencer marketing

1054
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,000
because those big brands are using those

1055
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:30,789
Instagram models to promote everything

1056
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,739
so that's why they in my opinion that's

1057
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:35,170
why they got rid of the likes last year

1058
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:36,849
for the majority of the accounts because

1059
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:38,980
you take away those lights from likes

1060
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:41,079
from the influencer pages and nobody

1061
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,429
really knows how powerful that account

1062
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:44,849
is on Instagram anymore

1063
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:47,679
it'll just say so many people and

1064
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:50,130
thousands of others of others like that

1065
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:50,129
photo

1066
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,219
no your that's what I mean you're kind

1067
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:02,949
of you're out there in the ocean if you

1068
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:04,298
will and there's really no way I mean

1069
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:05,768
one day Instagram to come and delete

1070
00:44:04,298 --> 00:44:07,659
your account and that's what I meant

1071
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:10,629
from before Lee we are building our

1072
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:12,308
houses on somebody other else's land and

1073
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,170
they can come and take that away from us

1074
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:16,930
at any time so that's why I wanted to

1075
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,759
show you guys in real time what if

1076
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:20,348
Instagram will start to do and start to

1077
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:22,630
threaten you if you do not play by the

1078
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:24,519
rules they're very secretive in the way

1079
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:26,410
the algorithm works the same way that

1080
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:27,909
Google is for a lot of those webmasters

1081
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:30,068
trying to figure out how to get you or

1082
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:32,259
brands on that top 10 list is the same

1083
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:33,849
thing with Instagram everybody sits

1084
00:44:32,259 --> 00:44:38,920
around and tries to figure out what is

1085
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:42,359
the best way to promote can you speak a

1086
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,358
little further into LinkedIn

1087
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,570
yes it's kind of the same way I mean

1088
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,849
right now my strategy on LinkedIn is

1089
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,260
just a post quality content and you

1090
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:06,509
don't really have to be on it as much

1091
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,220
because Microsoft is throwing a lot of

1092
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,740
money into that because they want to

1093
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:12,269
compete with Instagram the majority of

1094
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:13,799
the people since they're already posting

1095
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:15,719
on Instagram they just don't have enough

1096
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,880
time to go and do these other platforms

1097
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:20,730
so how do we get more people to come to

1098
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,769
LinkedIn before we start to encourage

1099
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:26,130
other people to see these profiles so

1100
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:27,719
you can post pretty gimmicky stuff on

1101
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,789
LinkedIn it was still kind of like a

1102
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,799
thousand two thousand people see that or

1103
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:33,840
on Instagram I mean you really have to

1104
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,650
have quality content get a thousand

1105
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,850
likes we are out of time thank you very

1106
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,849
much to Brian watts

1107
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,269
you
