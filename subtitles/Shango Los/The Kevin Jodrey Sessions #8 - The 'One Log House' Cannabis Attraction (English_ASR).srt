1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,080
so Kevin a lot of people are starting to

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,000
plan what they're gonna do this summer

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,009
right and a lot of people like to road

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,208
trip to California purity in California

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,830
you want to explore different parts of

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:19,189
the state and I know that you're moving

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,170
your operation from this location here

8
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:24,019
in Humboldt to another location in

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,720
Humboldt near the historical one log

10
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:28,460
location so I want to encourage people

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,049
to like pack all their stuff in their

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,270
car and come out to your new location

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,698
because after I've toured it today and

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,079
seen what its gonna be it's you know

15
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:37,939
it's it's a it's like almost like an

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,228
amusement park for cannabis and outdoor

17
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:40,818
people so so why don't you tell us a

18
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:42,530
little bit about what people can look

19
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:44,870
forward to when they visit this new one

20
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,049
log location on Highway 101

21
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:49,878
I'd love to the one log is a giant

22
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:51,948
redwood tree that was driven around the

23
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:53,388
country in the 50s and it's right in

24
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:55,128
front of our spot and it's hard one of

25
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:57,799
the most well known redwood landmarks in

26
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:59,119
all the region and you can go inside the

27
00:00:57,798 --> 00:01:01,158
tree and it's a basically a little house

28
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,318
but it's a good sized house inside of a

29
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:05,478
treatment and it's just fascinating to

30
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:09,290
have that historic piece and what we did

31
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:11,599
is we put in a dispensary and a nursery

32
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,190
that one can go and tour so you can go

33
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,169
to the nursery and look through a window

34
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:16,579
and see what's going on inside the

35
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,140
nursery itself so for a lot of people

36
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:20,510
that wanted to see cannabis in a nursery

37
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,189
form they'll have the ability and the

38
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,990
storefront will allow you to be able to

39
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:26,329
purchase products from our region and

40
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:29,109
we're also putting in a museum that'll

41
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:31,909
cover what is Humboldt County from a

42
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:34,189
land point of view meaning what makes

43
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,679
humble humble and then the history of

44
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:40,539
Humboldt County's basically exploitation

45
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,670
over the years and then in 68 this

46
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,950
reclamation of a culture we're humble

47
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,530
have been hacked to pieces in gold

48
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,420
mining and lumber and in 68 you have a

49
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,189
back to land movement and from that

50
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,379
movement phowa got the entire cannabis

51
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:56,209
world we know now in America was built

52
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:57,469
and we want to be able to show all these

53
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:58,519
components because they've never really

54
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,769
been showing we always show

55
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,750
pharmacopoeia which is cannabis medicine

56
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:03,908
that was allowed before they I want it

57
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,608
and then hemp

58
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:08,920
but this is actually cannabis people

59
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:11,378
growing cannabis duck in the helicopters

60
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,169
the end or revolution the big plant

61
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:16,628
revolution how to fifteen really changed

62
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:18,609
the region how Prop 60 for the new

63
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:20,739
legalization has changed the region and

64
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,049
then from that point twenty eighteen

65
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:25,900
forward what's our future with cannabis

66
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:27,250
in Humboldt County and also really it

67
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,110
mirrors what what's our future was

68
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,139
humpin with cannabis in all small

69
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,459
counties like humble and that museum is

70
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,659
what I'm excited about because it's the

71
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,340
first time we've ever got to really do

72
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:39,098
something like that where you get to

73
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,469
cover what were pot growers but like you

74
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:43,000
said to a model in camouflage with a bag

75
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:45,068
I mean they're coming up with all these

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,079
mock-ups of what it looked like for

77
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:49,389
people in the bushes carrying soil bags

78
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:51,219
climbing up hills ducking helicopters

79
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:53,018
what did indoor growers look like that

80
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,639
where entire buildings that were filled

81
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,250
with grows what had underground bunkers

82
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,139
look like what was a grow dozer which is

83
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,180
the super trucks Witter what's the

84
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:02,738
significance in generators where so much

85
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,989
of the indoor revolution was created

86
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,700
under generator power these are all the

87
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,620
things that people have to understand so

88
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:10,719
they can understand this evolution of an

89
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,629
industry so that they don't believe that

90
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,568
the industry was created January 1st

91
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:18,909
2018 and this new industry that we see

92
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:21,668
today somehow happened overnight on its

93
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:23,439
own with no history behind it and it's

94
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,969
the history behind it that lets you see

95
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,519
an evolution and lets you be aware of

96
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:29,379
choices and directions and how we got to

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
those directions and hopefully it allows

98
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:33,098
the people who see it to be able to make

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,439
better decisions on how they purchase

100
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:37,530
cannabis and how they view cannabis and

101
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,239
how possibly they even produce cannabis

102
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,879
so they get to realize that this was

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,370
really a true homegrown movement people

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,789
didn't come to Humboldt to grow pot they

105
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,829
came here to escape the world in 1968

106
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:53,888
and they wanted a counterculture life

107
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:56,620
that was less violent more communal more

108
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:58,299
holistic and in the process cannabis was

109
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,090
cultivated and then all of a sudden it

110
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,310
started to be sold and it organically

111
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,378
through this model the history of

112
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,810
Humboldt County cannabis is very much

113
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:10,329
like Dennis perÃ³n's model of medical

114
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,789
cannabis we're friends of his were ill

115
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,319
he created a situation that allowed

116
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:15,669
people to get free cannabis because they

117
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,649
noticed that the people who were ill did

118
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,810
better with cannabis he creates the

119
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:22,029
first cannabis clubs he creates the

120
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,709
first real social network with regular

121
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,059
people who didn't have real connect

122
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:27,310
could come there and be treated

123
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,430
compassionately meaning that you and you

124
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:34,720
are not ostracized for your lack of

125
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,478
money or your lack of social rank or

126
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,440
your choices with your sexuality or

127
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,539
color or religion

128
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,829
Dennis Peron didn't care who you were if

129
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,419
you need a cannabis you could come in

130
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:45,250
and if you could afford it he would buy

131
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:48,159
it and if you didn't use get it free

132
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,199
that was the basis of Humboldt County's

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,939
culture the same thing they they're

134
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,469
they're they're very important to

135
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:55,899
understand because it lets you see how

136
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,820
the humans behave when they're allowed

137
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:00,129
to behave that way and the beautiful

138
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,478
things that occur and it's important I

139
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,180
think for people to know this so that

140
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,139
they realize that regular people made

141
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,060
this happen

142
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,860
regular people created compassionate

143
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,538
cannabis regular people created the

144
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,060
industrial cannabis model were in now

145
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:14,680
and it allows you to say I got you it

146
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,750
wasn't created by these big companies or

147
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,848
these these big branded firms it was by

148
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,560
regular small people who did this which

149
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:22,689
means you're still very valid and that

150
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,490
you have an ability to make change

151
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:27,038
yourself and I think that when you see

152
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,629
these things that empowers people to

153
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,579
realize that and whatever you're into in

154
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,750
life you may have way more impact that

155
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,699
you have a believed and you

156
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,639
see these four these iconic figures and

157
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,279
iconic times and iconic places to really

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,750
appreciate it and when you do that it

159
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,099
empowers you in a way that you can

160
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,509
connect with because you're like wow the

161
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,460
cannabis is gonna be a trillion dollar

162
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,959
industry globally and in the United

163
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:49,239
States which is really driving this

164
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,519
thing forward so hard in a in a large

165
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,370
financial point of view it was created

166
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,799
by a bunch of people who were barefoot

167
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,620
in the hills you know basically

168
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,199
hillbillies and that's a huge statement

169
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,550
because it wasn't created by these mega

170
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,889
companies that said look this is what

171
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,419
cannabis should be what they're doing is

172
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,189
they're taking what cannabis was and

173
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:11,349
they're just repackaging it and with a

174
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:13,209
nicer TV set telling you this is what it

175
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,530
should look like and for me I want you

176
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:16,899
to be able to go back in time and

177
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:19,569
understand what drove this situation and

178
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:21,609
that's the beauty of the museum

179
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:23,589
component and the museum lets us bring

180
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,689
in locals we can then advertise the

181
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:27,879
locals that do production or have a

182
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:30,459
history in cannabis we can then sell

183
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:33,790
their products at the store the location

184
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:37,509
is got a setup in the back for music and

185
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,280
for just basic lounging to where we

186
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:40,959
don't have any official smoking spaces

187
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,359
but people can pull off the road enjoy

188
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,250
the museum check out the shop there's a

189
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,330
coffee shop and a restaurant connected

190
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,490
to it but in the back there's a

191
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:49,659
beautiful park you can come and just

192
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,819
take a break in and sit down and enjoy

193
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,630
and realize that Apple County life was

194
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:57,009
beautiful life the cannabis fueled a

195
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,319
lifestyle that was really holistically

196
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:01,060
healthy and it was only later on that it

197
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,500
became this incredible money chase where

198
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,079
people there kind of little lost in the

199
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,579
in the pursuit but the root of it is the

200
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,469
most beautiful route and that's what we

201
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:10,300
want to pull back and show is that the

202
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,440
roots of this industry and not dirty and

203
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,879
they don't need to be hidden that you

204
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,939
don't need

205
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,469
shamed and it allowed the region to be

206
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,639
able to get a little different view and

207
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,350
I'm really excited about it

208
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,300
so for people who want to come out and

209
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,070
and check out the museum and see some of

210
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,900
the awesome rare photographs you've

211
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,699
gotten some of the cool models and they

212
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:29,370
want to pick up some local product at

213
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,339
your dispensary you know I saw the

214
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,649
beautiful lush field in the back um what

215
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,629
are a couple of the big music events

216
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:37,799
that people can focus on because if

217
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,420
they're gonna even come out anyway they

218
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,400
might as well come out for from one of

219
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,480
these events and really you know be able

220
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,189
to have a whole experience while they're

221
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,450
there maybe spend the weekend oh yeah no

222
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,269
we're really fortunate that we're right

223
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:50,909
next door to French's camp which is the

224
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:53,879
site of northern Knights the Electronic

225
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,470
Music Festival and subsequently we're

226
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,850
right next door the same Frenchy's camp

227
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,520
where they have reggae on the river and

228
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,200
so both of these events have been

229
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,299
historically I think northern Knights is

230
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,269
in its 6th year reggae might be in its

231
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,860
30th 30th plus year maybe even a little

232
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:09,719
longer I think I've been in like 24 25

233
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,960
26 of them I've been in so many Africa

234
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,970
and they're really awesome festivals

235
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,299
because they're outside on the river and

236
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,800
they have been purchased by larger

237
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,389
companies that have the ability to help

238
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,430
with production a lot of these smaller

239
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,199
festivals needed assistance because

240
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,910
everything's so expensive nowadays and

241
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,009
in producing these things and so High

242
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,800
Times was able to lease the reggae on

243
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:34,259
the river and then the Emerald cup crew

244
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,269
which was Tim Blake and I believe a red

245
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:37,860
light or the truck permit of the name of

246
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:40,019
his exact name of the guy that he works

247
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,580
with they're gonna take on the northern

248
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,319
night's crew with the existing northern

249
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,060
Knights crew so that what you have is

250
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,670
you have some combined production on

251
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,769
these different venues and the events

252
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:51,360
then can really succeed and shine and

253
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,799
they're killer so if you've ever wanted

254
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,870
to see an electronic music festival that

255
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,490
goes on for a while that's in I believe

256
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,110
July and then the first weekend of

257
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,759
August of every year's reggae so if you

258
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,620
make it to one of these events we're

259
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,389
literally right next door to them on the

260
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,340
drive way through so just look to your

261
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:07,470
left and you'll see the one log and come

262
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,750
on and visit and there's there's cabin

263
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,180
lodging there's camping there's even VIP

264
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,519
you know five-star lodging down the road

265
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,469
so your beautiful towels in the area the

266
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,029
Bimbo's down the street so you have some

267
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,220
really upscale stuff and you also have

268
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,649
some really normal stuff too so like the

269
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,180
old river yeah you can escape your life

270
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,250
from the concrete and come to Humboldt

271
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,719
with this very little of it and so it

272
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,799
allows you and it's not that far I mean

273
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,080
really talking about three hours from

274
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,389
the Bay Area and 101 is a straight pipe

275
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,690
line up and it's very simple you can't

276
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:38,279
get lost that that makes it relatively

277
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,960
convenient and when you come up here

278
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,759
you're in you're in a world that makes

279
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,230
you think you're back in time and I

280
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,970
think for so many people that they need

281
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,600
it and the festival isn't harmful to

282
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,759
typically QD very nonviolent very little

283
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,830
trouble people are trying their best to

284
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,659
enjoy each other as people so it makes

285
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,330
this beautiful type of environment

286
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,860
that's unique and for anyone who hasn't

287
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,240
had a chance to check out the stuff here

288
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,639
I recommend it whether we were in the

289
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,289
shop or not it's really the festivals

290
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,490
themselves have been super natural for

291
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:06,870
the region and so many people have

292
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,509
fallen in love with Humboldt because

293
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,940
they came here to see music and they met

294
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:14,730
the locals and realized wow guys we're

295
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,610
all right and the locals here aren't

296
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,610
just men it's men and women and all ages

297
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,259
and all colors and all sexes so Humboldt

298
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,240
is one of the most really diverse group

299
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,580
of production grids in the world where

300
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,129
everybody who came here was accepted as

301
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,500
long as you didn't want to rat out your

302
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,929
neighbor and you didn't you're all right

303
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,100
and so you get to experience this really

304
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:39,629
genuine open type of situation that you

305
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,129
don't really get in life too much you're

306
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,840
in you're on urban areas that no one

307
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,759
wants to talk but here you can actually

308
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,820
sit down and have a conversation and

309
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:50,759
feel good and it's a it's just I'm so

310
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,410
happy that they were able to put the the

311
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,389
production teams together to keep these

312
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:56,549
festivals run in and now we have a long

313
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:58,199
term stability on both of them and it

314
00:10:56,549 --> 00:11:00,000
should really shine the region should

315
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,800
shine because of it right now so we'll

316
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,789
see you this summer at the one log

317
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,969
location on highway 101 on Bull County

318
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,980
alright

319
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,210
damn so will you turn that off the next

320
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,210
question I don't want to have record
