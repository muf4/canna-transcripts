1
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:16,199
so Jeff you know um there are lots of

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,629
variety of microbes in our soil and and

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,399
some of them are allies for the cannabis

4
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:23,250
plant but some of them are pathogenic

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,549
and could cause harm and you know we're

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,609
all wanting to to grow the the number

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,250
and variety of microbes in our soil but

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,409
we don't necessarily want to feed the

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,109
pathogenic one it's pathogenic ones so

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:40,979
what are your recommendations for us to

11
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:44,878
to feed and encourage the helpful

12
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:47,279
microbes without feeding the pathogenic

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,780
ones great question great question I'm

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,899
not sure I have a great answer that is a

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,410
great question right on you know the the

16
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,890
over overall answer is to make sure that

17
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:00,898
your soil is well aerated in other words

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,999
oxygen you don't want to have any

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,409
anaerobic pockets you're gonna have them

20
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,879
anyway because they're all over the soil

21
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,500
but you don't want to you know you don't

22
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,390
want you slowly become anaerobic

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,019
anywhere you want your compost pile to

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:17,489
come anaerobic though they the pathogens

25
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:19,799
tend to be anaerobic and the the aerobic

26
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:24,179
microbes the ones that rely on oxygen

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,090
tend not to be pathogenic and so keeping

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:31,260
the soil well aerated good soil

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,710
structure is very important and I think

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,730
that that's so again the over-over

31
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,929
overreaching answer is you want to make

32
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,310
sure everything is well area and if

33
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,080
you're gonna put a compost teas down you

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,560
want to make sure they're areata compost

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:48,539
teas not an aerobic compost teas in

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:51,740
terms of the soil itself you should take

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,950
into some consideration a lot of people

38
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:58,979
use manures in their composts I don't

39
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,320
use manures in my compost I don't need

40
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,790
them the reason why people use manures

41
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,459
and compost is because that's how people

42
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,380
got rid of them indoors oh you know we

43
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,209
all had horses we all had you know

44
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,060
carriages and stuff and so everybody

45
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:14,090
have you does you know you go out and

46
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,069
find manures now you

47
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,439
have your own but yeah you can make

48
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:20,839
compost without manures and and if you

49
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:24,259
use if you use you know leave clippings

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,430
and and you know grass clippings you

51
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:27,919
don't have a dog in the yard

52
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,500
chances are you have a fewer e.coli and

53
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,639
then in that compost so so like I think

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,009
that's up in the second half

55
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,229
be careful what you put in the soil and

56
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:39,169
and there again you want to pay

57
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:42,139
attention if you buy soil from someplace

58
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:44,329
that that you use manure in your compost

59
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:46,518
and then there are a lot of medicines

60
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,380
that go into the animals that produce

61
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,459
that stuff you might have some problems

62
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:53,030
so you want to make sure your

63
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,860
composition you good well done there

64
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,229
aren't any spice that weren't composted

65
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,840
and you want to be careful but again

66
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:01,789
aeration tends to cure correct a lot of

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,219
this stuff and really ventilation by the

68
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:08,298
way is a form of aeration is just above

69
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:10,579
ground so on that note so so you know I

70
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:14,390
stopped just consider myself a novice

71
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:17,959
cannabis grower and I often will still

72
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:20,089
get compacted soils and then and then

73
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,109
sometimes a hydrophobic top so the water

74
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:26,450
just runs off so I understand aerated

75
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:30,769
teas because I use aerated compost teas

76
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:33,578
all summer what can we do to aerate the

77
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:37,030
soil once it's already compacted sure

78
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:40,639
well if you're going in in containers

79
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,430
first of all I leave the old plant in

80
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,159
the container and when I put the new

81
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,590
plant in the roots will grow down the

82
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,049
same zones into the you know there's the

83
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:55,450
other as the old roots there so it makes

84
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,450
it easier for the plant to expand

85
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:00,889
compost itself will aerate you know the

86
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,319
microbes will move from the compost down

87
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:06,169
into the soil there's nothing wrong with

88
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:08,388
a little light actual aeration like you

89
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,099
were reading along like taking a

90
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:11,959
screwdriver and just standing there that

91
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:13,340
was great or a toothpick not good not to

92
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,319
pick another chopstick come like that

93
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,579
and stick it in a couple of places you

94
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,128
know you don't want to do it all

95
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,800
I grew up the root system but there's

96
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,908
nothing wrong with doing that and then

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,650
you got to go back and take a look at

98
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:28,079
see what your practices are why is it

99
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:29,728
getting compacted and it could be your

100
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,180
water around the stuff too much maybe

101
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:34,348
you'd meet the mulch mulch will help you

102
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,319
know maybe you're swell needs to be

103
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:38,788
changed but but it is a problem

104
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,169
aerations the key though so what do you

105
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:42,209
think about this solution friend

106
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:44,519
recommended me once he said do I well

107
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:46,620
this last summer had this compacted pot

108
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,930
he's like listen it's only a 10 gallon

109
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,959
pot so so you don't have a lot of room

110
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,120
to play but he went head was dry so it

111
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,758
wasn't holding onto the sides anymore

112
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,110
and so he recommended we just pull the

113
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,968
pot out and cut off about the last third

114
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,610
you know fluff up the bottom of the

115
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:07,649
roots put in some fresh properly

116
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,620
structured soil from somewhere else and

117
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:14,008
put the plant back in and as the new

118
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,288
roots grow into that soil it will kind

119
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:18,598
of give the pot you know a new sense of

120
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:22,439
life do you buy that yeah you know I'd

121
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:25,740
rather go out and give a 14 gallon pot

122
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,689
oh I see yeah and put the soil around

123
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,610
the existing root ball I think when you

124
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:32,189
cut that root ball you know cut off that

125
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,560
root ball right you're impacting the

126
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:36,300
ability of the leaves to take up the

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,370
nutrients that they need and so I think

128
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,408
I mean the least disturbance to the

129
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,629
roots as possible this is the key thing

130
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:44,990
and so I just get a bigger pot thank you

131
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,990
very much

132
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,040
you
