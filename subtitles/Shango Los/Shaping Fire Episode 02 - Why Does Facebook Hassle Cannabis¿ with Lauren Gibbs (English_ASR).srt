1
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:12,150
for both cannabis businesses and

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,610
cannabis activists the primary goal

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,310
nowadays is outreach if you are business

4
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,480
you are reaching out to new customers

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,390
establishing your brand experience and

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,649
securing market share for activists you

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,630
are teaching people about the benefits

8
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,089
of cannabis trying to get legislation

9
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,368
passed and attracting more activists to

10
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,170
the cause well the best way to do that

11
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,450
of course is social media it is

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,120
astonishingly cheap compared to print

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,340
radio and TV advertising in the past but

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,519
even more importantly it is fast and

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,789
very responsive so fast that we can even

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,620
perform real-time a B tests to find out

17
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,500
what kind of advertising delivers the

18
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,509
message most effectively unfortunately

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,730
Facebook and Instagram are screwing up

20
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,859
the efficiency of the process by using

21
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:58,140
obscure advertising guidelines and

22
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,390
selective enforcement you can have

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,159
50,000 or more people in your audience

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,500
only to have your page deleted without

25
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,090
warning and suddenly be invisible and

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,118
unable to contact all of your followers

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,920
it is absurd that this is still

28
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,170
happening and it puts American

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,000
businesses at risk across the country

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,680
what's worse is that Facebook and

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,978
Instagram are now suppressing political

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,750
content as well one social media

33
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,299
professional has taken it upon herself

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,340
to speak up for all of us and try to get

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,680
social media platforms to commit to a

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,810
clear set of guidelines so everyone in

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,618
cannabis can place advertising in a way

38
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,659
that is not full of guessing and hope

39
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:39,390
today's guess is Lauren Gibbs founder of

40

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,599
campaign welcome to the show Lauren oh

62
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:30,090
thanks Django I'm so excited to be here

63
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,009
on shaping fire today so you know let's

64
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,348
uh let's set out the groundwork for our

65
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:37,519
conversation today you know in what ways

66
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:40,259
do you see both cannabis companies and

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,840
cannabis activists being treated

68
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,628
unfairly by solar social media platforms

69
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,109
like Facebook and Instagram well the

70
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:52,949
content that cannabis company is share

71
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:55,290
is viewed by Facebook as illegal in many

72
00:02:52,949 --> 00:03:00,268
circumstances even when it's advocating

73
00:02:55,289 --> 00:03:03,000
for the legality of cannabis and so and

74
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,989
so in addition to just doing business

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,939
there also stopping posts about what

76
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,289
about legalization and states and

77
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,019
different initiatives that are happening

78
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:15,449
at the state level yes and that's the

79
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,099
most upsetting part I'm of course

80
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:19,138
there's there's an argument to be made

81
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,988
that cannabis businesses should be able

82
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:25,709
to advertise like alcohol companies do

83
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:28,230
but I'm also talking about cannabis

84
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,079
businesses and advocates that want to

85
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:33,929
advance the cause and those posts

86
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,569
specific to advocacy awareness customer

87
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,659
education are continue to be blocked

88
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:41,789
every day you know I think that a lot of

89
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,909
us in the cannabis industry we've all

90
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:46,769
heard of one company or another that got

91
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:49,229
to you know you know thirty thousand

92
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,060
sixty thousand followers and then all of

93
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,560
a sudden they're gone for a day or two

94
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,469
and then you see them come back and they

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,150
say oh we were deleted at 50,000 you

96
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:59,579
know please like us and tell your

97
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,099
friends again and for for cannabis

98
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:04,620
businesses that that hits their bottom

99
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,719
line that injures their reach and even

100
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,019
if they're working in their own state

101
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,780
legally but it seems a lot more

102
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:15,599
mischievious to stop advocacy and the

103
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,120
legalization that that political speech

104
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:22,408
can you give me an example of an

105
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,590
advocacy campaign that is being hindered

106
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:27,240
by social media platforms sure right

107
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:30,689
here in Denver right now we

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,030
have a yes on 300 initiative and this is

109
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:35,399
an initiative delao social use of

110
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:37,500
cannabis so that people tourists and

111
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,149
individuals can legally consumed in

112
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,129
locations outside of their home that

113
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,810
they own and it's a pretty

114
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,680
straightforward neighborhood social

115
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,598
supported social use pilot program and

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,810
repeatedly these ads are being blocked

117
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:54,120
on Facebook and the reason that they're

118
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,339
being blocked the notification states

119
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,530
that that is being blocked because they

120
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:04,829
promote illegal activity so and then and

121
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:06,388
so when when when they complain what it

122
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:07,978
what does Facebook say when they say hey

123
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,370
we're not promoting illegal activity

124
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:13,408
work we're encouraging people to vote

125
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,870
yeah well it would be great if when we

126
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:17,639
complained we got the answer so they

127
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,269
when they when they prompt you with this

128
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,430
response they do explicitly state that

129
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:26,639
that this ad promotes illegal activity

130
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,189
and they state however as the promote

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,840
awareness or advocacy are allowed if you

132
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:33,899
think we made a mistake please contact

133
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,848
us well cannabis businesses are

134
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:37,978
contacting Facebook and they even peel

135
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:41,610
these ads and the appeals just sit in

136
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:45,029
purgatory you do not get a response the

137
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,848
only time I ever got a response from an

138
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:50,668
appeal was after I contacted a BuzzFeed

139
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:54,538
reporter who sent screen grabs of my

140
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:56,218
denial to Facebook PR and that is not an

141
00:05:54,538 --> 00:06:00,629
acceptable route for other business

142
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:01,800
owners right so so the first wave cuz

143
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,968
I'm guy I've gotten one of those r ej

144
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,340
are actually I've gotten several of

145
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:07,439
those those advertising rejections

146
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,179
myself and they all seem like they're

147
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,829
they're kind of just sent back to me by

148
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,598
a bot and there's not even a human

149
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,609
playing along you know from your

150
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:16,379
research into this do you know how their

151
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,400
process works mean at what point does a

152
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:22,709
real human even look at my ad well I I

153
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,500
do think that humans do look at a lot of

154
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:28,079
the ads but they review millions of us

155
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,459
it's it's a huge scope and a lot of this

156
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,448
is outsource some of this happens

157
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:35,549
outside of the United States and I have

158
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,610
the sense that the ads on the rise above

159
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,740
social strategies Facebook page are some

160
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,960
getting routed into some other approval

161
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,848
process because typically ads are

162
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,228
approved or denied within 15 minutes and

163
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:47,279
i get facebook a lot of credit for

164
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:49,310
turning them around really quickly

165
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,559
because you think social media is

166
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:55,019
incredibly timely so if you have an ad a

167
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,089
super appropriate and topical to

168
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,889
something that is happening in that hour

169
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:02,459
you can get at approved in 15 minutes

170
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,379
that's amazing well when i post about

171
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:08,188
cannabis anything related to cannabis

172
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:11,430
advocacy or even related to their

173
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:15,150
censorship those ads take between eight

174
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,218
and 36 hours to be approved so that

175
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:19,228
tells me that someone has to go their

176
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:21,839
supervisor there's gotta be some

177
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:23,430
conversation happening internally when

178
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,438
they make that decision for it to be

179
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,199
that long outside of cannabis it is

180
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,879
unheard of to have an ad take that long

181
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,710
for approval that actually makes me

182
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,169
chuckle a little bit thinking about when

183
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:37,109
I place the advertising for this episode

184
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:39,359
to see how long it takes them to to

185
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,038
accept it you know cuz like who knows

186
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,468
you're probably on their hot list yeah

187
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,209
well I hope that you report that back to

188
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:47,519
me I'd be very interested I think that

189
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:50,818
you know I I don't know some stuff that

190
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,799
I i do get approve it unexpected some

191
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,449
stuff I don't and that's that's the

192
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,879
problem it's a complete black box

193
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,588
there's no transparency we try and

194
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,599
follow the rules around advocacy and we

195
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:03,060
still get denied sometimes these things

196
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,310
that are that are promoted that are a

197
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,629
blatant violation of the terms of

198
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,550
service but you managed to get them

199
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:10,680
through so there's a complete and

200
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,228
consistency and application of terms of

201
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,689
service so it's my goal is to have

202
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:18,329
facebook and instagram provide us clear

203
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:20,129
guidelines that industry professionals

204
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:21,688
and advocates can follow and then that

205
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:26,240
facebook and instagram can fairly

206
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:28,468
enforce let's uh let's focus in on the

207
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,050
selective enforcement of the guidelines

208
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:34,320
for a moment you know since you started

209
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,269
the end the social canavan campaign i'm

210
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,969
sure that you've attracted a lot of

211
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:41,299
feedback and interest from from people

212
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:44,670
who have you know not had their ads

213
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:49,379
approved can you give me an example of

214
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:50,849
of two similar ads that one was approved

215
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:57,990
and one was not

216
00:08:50,850 --> 00:09:01,230
for no reason that we know about well I

217
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:07,709
think a classic example is Catherine

218
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:10,879
Grimm who was on CNN high profits CNN

219
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:14,309
was promoting that of that series

220
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:17,360
actively using paid sponsorship to

221
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:19,859
promote their television show and

222
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,740
Catherine grim as a character on that

223
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,110
show was trying to promote it as well as

224
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,009
anyone in that position would and should

225
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,449
and her ads were getting tonight wow so

226
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,669
that's actually a really great example

227
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:35,458
so they were they were same or similar

228
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:37,860
ads one from the media company and one

229
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,599
from the individual human and the media

230
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,639
company was getting accepted and the

231
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,560
human was not wow I guess it really

232
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,389
depends on who you know and I guess that

233
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,838
really makes sense with the example that

234
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:51,539
you gave earlier about how you have you

235
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,269
know probably bombarded Facebook with

236
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:56,789
messages looking for clarification but

237
00:09:54,269 --> 00:10:00,870
it wasn't until you know somebody with a

238
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:03,328
lot of ears like BuzzFeed writing

239
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,250
directly to the PR folks at Facebook

240
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:06,719
that they had any response at all and

241
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,500
what did they say what do they say when

242
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,560
they responded to BuzzFeed oh they just

243
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,899
say they erroneously denied my ad and

244
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,588
let me state for the record that wasn't

245
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:22,318
ad promoting a colorado public radio

246
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:25,189
story about racial disparities in youth

247
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:27,360
arrest rates for marijuana in Colorado

248
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:28,828
that doesn't that doesn't even make any

249
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,079
sense i mean sometimes i can even

250
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:33,059
understand that facebook's lawyers are

251
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:35,519
so afraid of the cannabis businesses

252
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:37,469
that that they may want some more

253
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,568
security before i mean i can kind of see

254
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,629
that point but with an article like that

255
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:44,309
it's only tangentially even about the

256
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:46,828
purchase and sale of cannabis that's

257
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:49,859
about you know law enforcement prisons

258
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:52,708
and race relations how could i see i see

259
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,409
a situation you know yeah yeah is it

260
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:57,328
because it's it's a lottery every time

261
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:59,250
you try to promote something you you

262
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:00,778
really really can't know and i work in

263
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,028
social media outside of cannabis and

264
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,769
well as well and there's never this wild

265
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:08,188
card that you can act

266
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,318
we use advertising to plan the promotion

267
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:12,058
of your business your advocacy campaign

268
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:14,789
and there's some sense of reliability

269
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:17,278
that that can be a useful strategy to

270
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:19,438
advance your cause that that's Avenue is

271
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,119
just not available to us so how

272
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:23,428
widespread did this I mean we've been

273
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:25,170
kind of picking on facebook so far but

274
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:28,438
across the different social media

275
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:30,628
platforms is there some variety of who

276
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:34,738
is more generous with cannabis folks and

277
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:37,769
who is less well Facebook and Instagram

278
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:39,239
are oh you know that's one company and

279
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,739
there they actually have a single set

280
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:44,129
about advertising guidelines that

281
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:46,679
applies to to both platforms and you run

282
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:48,869
your ads through a single dashiell for

283
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:52,759
that so I would say that Facebook and

284
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:55,230
Instagram treated equally I don't see I

285
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:58,860
don't hear much of a crackdown on

286
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,079
Twitter but in my professional opinion

287
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,438
for a lot of companies Instagram and

288
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:06,178
Facebook is a more powerful tool so you

289
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:07,769
know I and I often hear people saying oh

290
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:09,298
you can go over to Twitter where they

291
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,039
don't enforce this or you could go over

292
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:12,659
to these other cannabis specific social

293
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,730
networks that have so far smaller

294
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:17,789
audiences but that's just not acceptable

295
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,889
solution to me yeah being relegated to

296
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:21,928
the back water is not a solution when

297
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,850
you're trying to promote any idea to the

298
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:25,470
largest audience so we're going to take

299
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:30,149
our first short break and be right back

300
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:32,040
you are listening to shaping fire as a

301
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,230
business owner you are incredibly busy

302
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,688
in reality you are responsible for

303
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,639
everything your company does you have so

304
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:40,438
many responsibilities every single day

305
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,659
that often you just don't have the time

306
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:45,419
to really dig into something as deeply

307
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,649
as you'd like you know there is more

308
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,868
that you could do to reach out to new

309
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:50,759
customers and to encourage loyalty and

310
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,619
the customers you already have but you

311
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,449
certainly don't have the time and you're

312
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:57,329
not ready to hire someone full time for

313
00:12:54,448 --> 00:13:00,659
that role either for you i recommend

314
00:12:57,328 --> 00:13:02,849
blunt branding blunt branding principles

315
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:05,129
Kirsten Nelson and Anthony Garcia are

316
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,409
focused on improving your bottom line

317
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:09,749
you know most marketing firms are

318
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:11,969
excited to make your logo packaging and

319
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:13,798
website very pretty but they leave

320
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,990
responsibility for improving your bottom

321
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:18,419
line up to you they don't want that kind

322
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,159
of responsibility but that is

323
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:23,250
pretty much the most important part of

324
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,860
marketing right Kirsten and Anthony will

325
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,899
help you engage new customers funnel

326
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,759
them to your point of sale and keep them

327
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:32,339
coming back to you and telling their

328
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,169
friends no doubt this is a paid

329
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,449
commercial spot but that does not mean

330
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:38,669
they bought my opinion I've worked with

331
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:41,009
blunt branding on three projects now for

332
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:42,208
various clients and every single time

333
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:44,778
they have done more than they have

334
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:47,429
promised and over delivered on results I

335
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:49,980
love how they generate new revenue and

336
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:52,708
focus on that as the goal instead of

337
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,839
just making me a pretty logo similarly

338
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,698

our guest this week is lauren gibbs of

357
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:43,649
rise above social strategies so Lauren

358
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,589
before the break we were talking about

359
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,839
how all the social media platforms but

360
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:51,810
specifically Facebook and Instagram

361
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,699
probably at the worst is selective and

362
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:55,588
how they apply their guidelines in

363
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:57,990
accepting ads from both cannabis

364
00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:00,420
companies and cannabis advocacy groups

365
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,039
at the state level and you know kind of

366
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:04,289
behind this whole thing is this idea

367
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,789
that Facebook is afraid of something and

368
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:07,259
you know it doesn't take a rocket

369
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:08,909
scientist to go well it's probably

370
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:12,419
because it's you know federally illegal

371
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:14,159
but but even that makes me more curious

372
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:17,370
because at the state level these

373
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,588
companies are legal and acting as good

374
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,509
actors in their states now I don't know

375
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:24,209
anybody who's looking into this more

376
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:26,578
than you are and so you know as the

377
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:28,649
expert can you give us some ideas even

378
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:30,719
if they're just suggestions on what

379
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:32,490
might be going through the minds

380
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,720
the attorneys at Facebook and Instagram

381
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,970
that caused them to be so concerned and

382
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,480
not want to share community guidelines

383
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:45,028
on this mm-hmm well I think federal

384
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,159
prohibition can't be understated there's

385
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:49,860
a natural fear of racketeering charges

386
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:54,809
drug trafficking charges for an a huge

387
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:57,149
company like facebook but Facebook has

388
00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:00,628
the technology available to geo-target

389
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:04,259
an eight restrict posts to states that

390
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:06,539
have legalized cannabis and we can we

391
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,539
can use them when we can get as approve

392
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:11,818
but why not leverage that technology

393
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:14,338
even further and allow us to use it and

394
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:15,778
thrive in that environment where we're

395
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:20,250
only speaking to customers in our

396
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:21,899
state's so so what what I mean do that

397
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,269
dude would you think that the attorneys

398
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,309
are honestly afraid of the government

399
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:28,589
bringing federal racketeering charges

400
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:30,088
that seems like such an absurd idea and

401
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:32,399
maybe that's at the cornerstone of this

402
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,110
right maybe this whole topic is absurd

403
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,610
and and that would be something that I

404
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,278
would I would just have to deal with but

405
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,740
but does anybody suggest that that would

406
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,629
actually happen or is it just facebook

407
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,600
because they're so valued and they're a

408
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:49,259
public company they have to play super

409
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,240
safe well the lawyers are always going

410
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,889
to tell you to play it safe yeah you

411
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,480
know don't point out that something is

412
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:56,278
illegal federally and we shouldn't do

413
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,740
this and that's that's the heart of my

414
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,720
argument here is that I I think that

415
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,818
honestly I think that Mark Zuckerberg

416
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,669
probably agrees with me on the whole

417
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:07,588
here and it's going to take a major

418
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:10,169
national company to show some leadership

419
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:14,730
and say you know we're not going to

420
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:16,949
continue to follow this insane federal

421
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,099
law when we have half of the states have

422
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:21,179
legal cannabis and some poor you know

423
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,818
that's one of the things I've liked

424
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:27,360
about your campaign for and the social

425
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:30,808
canna ban because you always tag

426
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:34,229
whatever platform it's on Zuckerberg

427
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:37,470
himself and you you you run the campaign

428
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:40,558
as if you're in conversation with him it

429
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:43,440
would be so visionary if he would just

430
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,839
step out and magnanimous

431
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,850
we changed the policy regardless of what

432
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,949
his attorneys are saying and instead

433
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:55,829
just be on the right side of history you

434
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:57,808
know a girl can dream I'm assuming that

435
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:59,990
when you tag him in these posts that

436
00:17:57,808 --> 00:18:02,730
you've never gotten a response right uh

437
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:07,048
I mean my websites been visited a number

438
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:08,490
of times from Palo Alto so I someone may

439
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:10,500
be looking at it I haven't gotten a

440
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,079
response though right on yeah but let me

441
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,599
say that you know I I have a lot of

442
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:18,148
admiration for Mark Zuckerberg he's a

443
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,908
true visionary and I have created a

444
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:24,949
career out of social media and I loved

445
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:27,330
it and he does some incredible work and

446
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,919
causing these wonderful shifts in our

447
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:30,839
culture that allow us to create

448
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,580
community around brands and community

449
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,939
around causes in a way that we serve

450
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:37,470
lost as a society so I you know there's

451
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,659
plenty of people to comment on my stuff

452
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,120
negatively about Mark Zuckerberg but I

453
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:45,120
don't approach the conversation as that

454
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,158
adversarial I think that he is a leader

455
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,479
and I think that it would be amazing if

456
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,539
you could go down in history and help

457
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,940
you know shifting to the end of

458
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:55,648
prohibition you know I think that's a

459
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,230
really good clarification to make too

460
00:18:55,648 --> 00:19:00,268
because you know so often trolls will

461
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,308
put comments like you know screw bark

462
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:04,079
Zuckerberg or whatever and really you

463
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,418
know I've got friends that I'm friendly

464
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,158
with and we have dinner and we have you

465
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,019
know disagreeing political positions

466
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,730
that doesn't mean I dislike the person

467
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,980
it just means them I you know I would

468
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,558
encourage or educate them to potentially

469
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,440
change their position or not you know so

470
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,388
I think that's I think that's a really

471
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,558
responsible position to take to make

472
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:25,949
sure that there's a difference between

473
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:28,048
the human and and the implementation of

474
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:32,278
a policy you know during the during the

475
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:36,418
first set you were talking about how to

476
00:19:32,278 --> 00:19:38,730
similar advertising buys were treated

477
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,919
differently one was from CNN and one was

478
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,690
from the media personality that was

479
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,669
trying to do it on their own as an

480
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,960
individual citizen and that then that

481
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:51,809
CNN there's got approved and the

482
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,149
individual persons did not do you see a

483
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:56,549
lot of that kind of favoritism taking

484
00:19:54,148 --> 00:20:00,779
place by people who have got PR

485
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:02,970
apartments oh absolutely I am High Times

486
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:06,809
has five and a half million followers on

487
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:11,700
Facebook but when you have a small

488
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:13,649
business that baby has 1300 followers or

489
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,970
thirteen thousand followers and they get

490
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:20,009
shut down they don't have the resources

491
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:21,930
or the clow to appeal it if you're a

492
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:24,299
major national name and you're having

493
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:28,380
problems with Facebook and Instagram

494
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:30,599
they're going to pay attention but when

495
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,840
these small players and in cannabis is a

496
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,069
lot of small players there is this huge

497
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,589
entrepreneurial environment so many

498
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:40,500
startups and so many people spending

499
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:42,720
scarce resources to build brands build a

500
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,210
company to advocate for cause and they

501
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,480
invest a lot of time in building these

502
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,430
communities and then they just get

503
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,880
yanked away and they literally have no

504
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:56,160
recourse you know it's I'm not

505
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,690
unfamiliar with the rumor and I'm hoping

506
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,480
that you can tell me to what degree you

507
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,460
think it's true that you know what these

508
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,099
small players in these new markets

509
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,750
they've got a competitor and so they get

510
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:10,019
you know everybody at their business and

511
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,119
a bunch of their friends to go and you

512
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,730
know click the button is this offensive

513
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:17,639
or illegal to our guidelines button and

514
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,620
they all turn in one company's page to

515
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,420
try to get rid of their competitors and

516
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:23,819
wow I don't know if this is urban myth

517
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,220
or not but you know have you heard about

518
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:27,480
this strategy working is this something

519
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,230
that you're seeing happen with you and

520
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,900
your clients I i I've heard of this and

521
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,670
you know I think that anyone who's like

522
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,940
an ethical and responsible business

523
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,019
owner would not pursue that strategy

524
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,910
because if you have a good product in a

525
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:43,559
good cause you don't need to attack a

526
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,140
competition that way you should just be

527
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,419
able to focus on your message and built

528
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,509
following that way but that sort of

529
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:55,019
underscores that that is a perversion of

530
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:57,210
the reporting mechanism if we simply had

531
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:59,819
terms of service that were more clear

532
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:03,480
provided a framework that we could abide

533
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:05,009
by then there wouldn't be that weird you

534
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,410
know perversion that allows people to

535
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:09,210
attack each other yeah I think that's

536
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,900
probably got to be the most frustrating

537
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,850
aspect

538
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,950
all of this is that you know not that

539
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:16,199
they're not allowing cannabis while that

540
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,529
is frustrating it's that we don't know

541
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,150
where anybody is drawing the lines and

542
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:23,539
the lines are being drawn differently

543
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,550
for big companies versus small companies

544
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:29,159
potentially by who the reviewer is of

545
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:31,440
the ad and as you've told me about you

546
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,240
know when you press an ad sometimes

547
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,309
they'll flip flop their opinion and like

548
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,190
oh that was a mistake you know but but

549
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:40,369
that is not the way to make social

550
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,559
policy right that does not allow

551
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:48,089
marketing teams and advocates to plan

552
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:52,019
out a media campaign that is strong and

553
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:53,970
will have good reach but also meets the

554
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:56,099
Facebook guidelines and I think that

555
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:59,100
moving target is probably what really

556
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:01,439
annoys people the most well they lose

557
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:03,449
money because of it because you can't

558
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,420
you can't have a plan and you can't

559
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,279
execute with consistency if you have a

560
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:12,660
morgan target like that it's guesswork

561
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:15,839
all the time so i would think that right

562
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,910
now coming up to the elections there's

563
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,429
probably a lot one of those there's nine

564
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,410
states that are looking to move towards

565
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:25,259
normalization and they're probably very

566
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:28,710
actively trying to educate via facebook

567
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:32,309
it's probably a total mess about which

568
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:34,710
ads are gonna be a loud and from state

569
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,779
to state our people reaching out to you

570
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,039
to you know share their stories with you

571
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:40,859
what are you seeing on the front lines

572
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:42,869
I'm so glad you asked this because I do

573
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,309
have people reach out to me but honestly

574
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:47,279
I would like to see more people reach

575
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:49,919
out to me because there's no

576
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,379
transparency as to what's going on ads

577
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:55,350
get denied and people appeal them and I

578
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:58,710
sit in purgatory and I've just decided

579
00:23:55,349 --> 00:24:01,259
that I'm have to serve as the watchdog

580
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,210
for this problem so when people have

581
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:05,099
something that's denied I'd love when

582
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,650
they send me a screen grab of their

583
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:10,679
original post and then a screen grab of

584
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:14,070
the reason which they were denied which

585
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:17,430
is often for promoting illegal activity

586
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:19,559
and that's incredibly helpful to the

587
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,330
cause because we're we're helping

588
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,950
generate a conversation that I mean can

589
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,720
look for patterns of inconsistent

590
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,460
see and help make the case to Mark

591
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,350
Zuckerberg that look this needs to be

592
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,759
addressed because we are just lost here

593
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:36,119
we can't follow any double roles so I

594
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:38,549
think having a what having community

595
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,619
support is essential to advancing this

596
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:42,779
so I hope anyone out there would you

597
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:44,309
know tag me on Instagram with a post you

598
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:47,460
can see an me on Facebook or Instagram

599
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:49,740
with these examples and especially on

600
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,720
him on my Instagram at rise above social

601
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,730
you'll see examples people reach out to

602
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,759
me and someone got shut down and I like

603
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:58,890
to profile that because it's not about

604
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,579
rise above social is about the community

605
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,630
and these small businesses that are

606
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:06,629
taking a hit because of this

607
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,370
inconsistent policy we're gonna take a

608
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:12,570
short break and be right back you are

609
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:14,009
listening to shaving fire look inside

Shengo lowson our guest this week is

646
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:44,158
Lauren Gibbs of rise above social

647
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,929
strategies so before the break you know

648
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,900
we have kind of brought this to a

649
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:51,210
crescendo you know there are cannabis

650
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,669
companies that are getting their pages

651
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,590
yanked from them and going back to their

652
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:57,960
first like again and there's there's

653
00:26:55,589 --> 00:27:00,389
advocacy at both the state and federal

654
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,490
level that's being shut down and no one

655
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:05,340
knows why because there's no shared

656
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,990
guidelines and we all just assume that

657
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:10,168
is because the Facebook and Instagram

658
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:13,528
lawyers are playing very serious defense

659
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:15,509
well I know that since you started the

660
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:19,019
end the social canna ban you've taken

661
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:21,089
this up as an activist yourself but you

662
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:23,129
probably see what our paths would look

663
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:26,069
like to get their attention how do we

664
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,990
get this change Lauren well there's one

665
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:29,658
thing that Mark Zuckerberg certainly

666
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,940
pays attention to and it's community

667
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:35,940
metrics so when things get shared in a

668
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,490
phenomenal way that that Garner's

669
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,169
attention from from facebook and if we

670
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,440
can increase the organic reach meaning

671
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:45,480
the unpaid reach of all of my messages

672
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,058
for this campaign we can help get

673
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,829
attention from him because all we want

674
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:52,220
is for him to have a conversation with

675
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:55,048
us and I'd like to be able to speak to

676
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,329
Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg about the

677
00:27:55,048 --> 00:28:00,058
ways that this inconsistent policy is

678
00:27:57,329 --> 00:28:01,889
affecting focuses and advocates and we

679
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:04,200
just want to have that conversation so

680
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:07,620
individuals can be very helpful to that

681
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:11,308
by helping share these posts tagged us

682
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:13,798
and examples of censorship share our

683
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:17,158
posts for had the word all every like

684
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:18,898
share comment counts so so when you're

685
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,840
saying sharing you're talking about

686
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:24,658
specifically sharing posts that include

687
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:28,199
the hashtag and the social canavan are

688
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:30,630
you talking about just sharing posts

689
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,440
from one of your social media profiles

690
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:36,419
so that so that the profile gets more

691
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,519
attention what specifically do you want

692
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:42,320
people to share to increase the metrics

693
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,319
so that Zuckerberg pays more attention

694
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:50,899
I think telling your own story with the

695
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:53,359
hashtag is important and so if you have

696
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,769
experienced censorship yourself I really

697
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,649
want to hear your story how that

698
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:59,808
affected you and your business and add

699
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,700
the end of social canavan hashtag so

700
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:04,548
that I can track those conversations and

701
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,350
a lot of those conversations and stories

702
00:29:04,548 --> 00:29:08,329
are going to be worth highlighting so

703
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:09,949
when you use the hashtag that allows me

704
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,389
especially on Instagram that allows me

705
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,400
to track that conversation and find

706
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,919
those stories and share them lift them

707
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,620
up and give them a larger platform

708
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:20,570
especially you know after or they may

709
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:22,339
have been blocked from their twelve

710
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:24,379
thousand followers and they're starting

711
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:25,970
with five followers it's hard for them

712
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,340
to get that story out but tagged me and

713
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,960
I'll help you get that story out but

714
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:31,788
then on Facebook you know I post a lot

715
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,690
of educational content about why this

716
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:37,819
matters examples of the censorship

717
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:40,730
examples of censorship in other areas

718
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:42,379
and sharing those posts is is important

719
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,210
because it helps everyone educate their

720
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,890
own personal networks about why this is

721
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,750
important because the more people that

722
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,570
care the more likely we are to bring

723
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,788
about change do we have any examples of

724
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:56,480
this happening with another industry or

725
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:59,240
community has anybody ever you know

726
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,130
pushed and engaged Facebook because

727
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,230
outside what's an example of somebody

728
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:07,490
who won doing this yeah well you know

729
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:10,730
Facebook used to censor photos of women

730
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:13,609
breastfeeding and they would get flagged

731
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:15,558
from nudity and there was a grassroots

732
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:17,209
movement on this where women changed

733
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:18,678
their profile their public profile

734
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:22,159
pictures to the photo of them

735
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,230
breastfeeding their child and it got a

736
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,200
lot of attention and Facebook actually

737
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:30,909
changed their policy on nudity such that

738
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,500
you that photos of breastfeeding and

739
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:37,250
post-mastectomy surgical photos are

740
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:40,369
allowed so it happened they listened to

741
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,720
a community and there was change and we

742
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:43,668
just want to be next that seems like a

743
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,159
pretty reasonable requests especially

744
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:49,340
since you're not necessarily demanding a

745
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,809
change in the policy here you're asking

746
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:54,709
for a conversation to figure out what

747
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:56,119
the policy even is absolutely so you

748
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,370
know you mentioned a couple times during

749
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:02,750
our talk that there are people

750
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:04,909
who have had their pages spiked or taken

751
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,859
away but then they've gotten them back

752
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,480
so so let's say that we've got a

753
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:11,959
business owner or an advocate who's

754
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,150
listening and and sometimes soon they

755
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,039
their page is gone and it says because

756
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,440
they're they're violating guidelines

757
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:23,779
what what what should they do to try to

758
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:26,390
get their page back well honestly it's a

759
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:29,058
whack Amole situation I would say file

760
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:33,110
an appeal but is probably going to end

761
00:31:29,058 --> 00:31:35,058
up in purgatory what most businesses do

762
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:40,308
is they just set up another account and

763
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:43,190
start over and you may hear in a couple

764
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:46,069
months they you know a response to your

765
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,630
appeal and your pages back up and then

766
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:51,379
you have the problem with having to

767
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:53,210
reconcile to Instagram accounts yeah and

768
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,309
that's something that's having a coral

769
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:57,710
reefer several times she said several

770
00:31:55,308 --> 00:32:00,889
accounts shut down after over a hundred

771
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:03,110
thousand followers and she pops up

772
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,450
another one and you know pick up fifteen

773
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:08,389
thousand in a couple weeks and then she

774
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,240
gets a notice later that her page was

775
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,590
restored she's like well I was just

776
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,880
spent all the time cultivating in your

777
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:21,619
community over error and now I get this

778
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:24,260
back so it's it's a mess it is just a

779
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:27,529
mess as a waste of resources for so many

780
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:29,390
businesses so it doesn't sound like

781
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,759
there's actually an elegant solution if

782
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:34,759
you if your page gets dropped your just

783
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,490
hosed there really isn't a way to appeal

784
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:39,109
that is timely and you know as as

785
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,049
business people are advocates we just

786
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:43,279
have to keep on moving forward so and it

787
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:46,669
doesn't sound like there's really any

788
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,099
way to to stay on their good side I mean

789
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:51,769
if you are in cannabis in any way and

790
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:53,509
even reporting cannabis news you could

791
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:55,609
end up being a target gosh that's

792
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,679
frustrating right and there's a lotta

793
00:32:55,609 --> 00:33:00,529
there's a lot of folks out there and I

794
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,720
know some other social media folks will

795
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:06,250
advise you know to avoid the use of

796
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:10,539
certain keywords but even that is not

797
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:13,059
always a foolproof plan so

798
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:16,029
before we wrap up you know one of the

799
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:18,669
important things is for everybody in the

800
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:20,259
scene to be you know motivated an

801
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,940
activist right a lot of people are

802
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:24,160
starting to think all you know you know

803
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,600
cannabis is legal in my state and so

804
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,620
people are starting to shift more

805
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:31,029
towards the business side then the

806
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:35,019
advocacy side but you know most of the

807
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:37,509
country is still not legal even if they

808
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:41,500
are moving towards normalization and so

809
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:44,019
we as as cannabis enthusiasts all need

810
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,299
to raise our hand to be proud of what

811
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:50,079
we're involved with and to make our

812
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:53,859
voice heard so what do you say is the

813
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:57,009
best the best actions that an individual

814
00:33:53,859 --> 00:34:01,629
person can do to make their voice heard

815
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:04,750
and to feed you situations that you can

816
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:08,200
use in building a case for for evolving

817
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:10,179
these guidelines well what individuals

818
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,579
can absolutely do is share these stories

819
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:14,889
with me so again sending those screen

820
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:17,380
grabs of your original post and your

821
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:19,210
denial notification by DM to me on

822
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:22,419
facebook or instagram is incredibly

823
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:25,150
helpful now you know I have been talking

824
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:26,829
openly to Mark Zuckerberg for a long

825
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,869
time now and I haven't gotten a response

826
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:31,539
yet so I can't guarantee to anyone that

827
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:35,259
is actually going to cause reversal but

828
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:37,480
by contributing their story to what what

829
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,340
I'm doing it's going to help elevate and

830
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,909
we need points of evidence to make this

831
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:45,640
case for them to pay attention and have

832
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:47,440
this dialogue with us because it's it's

833
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,879
all hidden right now and if they can

834
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,150
share that information with me and these

835
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,519
stories we can we can have a more

836
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:56,250
informed dialogue one thing we've all

837
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:58,809
learned is that crowdsource

838
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,570
crowdsourcing money or ideas or

839
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:03,759
political influence it's it's the way of

840
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,610
the future you know they the big

841
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,410
corporations can ignore individuals and

842
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:12,010
even small groups but when we band

843
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:15,250
together we've got a voice that that

844
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:17,890
they have to listen to absolutely and

845
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,570
that is that is the point of social

846
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,279
media that's what I love about it that's

847
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,630
what's so beautiful you can make the

848
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,750
kind of impact that you never could make

849
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,220
in the past because

850
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,369
you can spread things and share things

851
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:30,980
so quickly with your network it's

852
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:33,130
wonderful so we're that's why I want to

853
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,590
use this platform to change this

854
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:39,260
situation I love that let's work

855
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,930
together to make this change so Lauren

856
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:45,410
what can businesses do to be supportive

857
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:46,669
of this into to help pressure facebook

858
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:49,670
for guidelines without putting

859
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:51,320
themselves at too much risk well there

860
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,789
is an inherent risk every day when

861
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,530
you're operating on social media and

862
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:57,500
cannabis you can get shut down at any

863
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:59,090
time so accepting that it's just part of

864
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,519
operating in cannabis business on social

865
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:05,000
media but I invite business owners to be

866
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,440
a part of this message and you know when

867
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,110
I approached Willie's reserved about

868
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,900
supporting the end of social canavan you

869
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,730
know we discussed that that this is

870
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,530
something that could bring some

871
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,730
additional attention from facebook and

872
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:21,080
instagram to their accounts and

873
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:23,119
ultimately the answer came down that

874
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,219
they follow the guideline what would

875
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,719
really do and Willie always you know

876
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:28,129
stands up for what he thinks is right

877
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,879
enjoyed the cause even if it's not

878
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:33,890
popular even if it's risky so only by

879
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,320
joining our voices together as business

880
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:38,389

881
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,820
statement so I'm so happy to have you
