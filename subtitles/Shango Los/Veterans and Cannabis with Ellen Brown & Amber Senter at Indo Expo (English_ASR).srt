69
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:42,970
in amber Aaronic applause so to get

70
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:45,489
started I want to ask you what aspects

71
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:47,409
of your military experience especially

72
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:50,439
prepared you from working in the

73
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:52,689
cannabis industry thank you

74
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,659
so my name is Ellen today around my

75
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:59,919
amazing Air Force veteran and what I did

76
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:01,689
this was nutrition so nutritional airman

77
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,909
and part of my job is teaching

78
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:07,270
one-on-one classes well I was teaching

79
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:10,240
large classes for prenatal care

80
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,010
gestational diabetes if you failed your

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,650
PT test I would be the first person you

82
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:16,000
would see so what I was able to take

83
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,129
away from that was learning how to teach

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,650
learning how to do one on one occasion

85
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,990
counselees in how to create curriculum

86
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,680
which I found very much transferrable to

87
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:30,070
sensimilla seminars so I used my

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,379
abilities to teach create educational

89
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:35,739
material that was easy to understand and

90
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:40,750
then I've been able to really perpetuate

91
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:42,700
education on the East Coast so another

92
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,300
thing that I was able to take away from

93
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:48,219
the military was being able to find

94
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,990
people that I could rely on and know

95
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,960
that my strengths would complement their

96
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,400
weaknesses and vice versa so really

97
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,860
putting myself out there and finding

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,650
like my cannabis community much like my

99
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,040
my brother-in-arms I have my brothers in

100
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,420
cannabis I can imagine that the the

101
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,810
instrument role that you played with

102
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,519
interviewing soldiers who are probably

103
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,770
not always as upfront about their

104
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,610
physical wellness as they could be

105
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:18,759
because you know you know weakness is is

106
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:21,129
shamed and and and folks always want to

107
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,240
let their spirit officers believe that

108
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:25,069
there

109
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,470
and and you learn how to create that

110
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:29,540
intimacy as well which I can imagine is

111
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,090
important when working with veterans in

112
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,169
the cannabis industry

113
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:34,519
absolutely when I would do the

114
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:36,109
one-on-one patient counseling people

115
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,549
could be there for a wide variety of

116
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,379
reasons and sometimes they were very

117
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,419
receptive to the information I'm going

118
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,519
to impart on them whether or not that

119
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:45,168
was setting up a nutritional program

120
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,500
whether or not it was them coming back

121
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:50,000
weekly bi-weekly monthly and with

122
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,379
cannabis it's that same thing people

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,228
come in with a little bit of trepidation

124
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:56,240
or when they come in I have to kind of

125
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:58,129
pull out from them what do you want what

126
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,110
are you thinking and just having

127
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:01,939
patience and understanding especially

128
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,250
from commenting from the medical field

129
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:06,168
because cannabis is a medicine you do

130
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,750
have your and no cannabinoid system your

131
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:11,060
CV one receptor your cb2 receptor which

132
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,180
a lot of people aren't as educated on as

133
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,589
thank you morning so I've been able to

134
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,240
teach them that information and then

135
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:20,119
having going to be their own best

136
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,889
advocates is really what I like to drive

137
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,990
home whether or not it was teaching my

138
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,250
nutritional classes where we would sit

139
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,600
down and then you would come back and

140
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,639
tell me how your results were when

141
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,340
you're away and with this I would give

142
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,970
you all the tools you need to be able to

143
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:34,250
better understand your own

144
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,490
endocannabinoids system your own self

145
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,490
titration dosing what works best for you

146
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,410
so actually as I'm saying it is it's

147
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,728
very much transferable sterling I was

148
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,320
tired of creating those different

149
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:47,870
nutritional plans for people now we're

150
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,659
creating different cannabis plants for

151
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,699
people whether or not it's I have a four

152
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,460
by four space with streams my grow or I

153
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:57,050
have an outdoor field and being what can

154
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:59,569
you do so sitting down and seeing what

155
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,348
resources we have and then just rolling

156
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:06,139
from there I know that you know our

157
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:09,099
industry has got a lot of inside

158
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:12,069
vocabulary and certainly the military

159
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,160
as well do you find that having a

160
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:17,110
pre-existing shared vocabulary with the

161
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,080
veterans helps you bring them up to

162
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,480
speed in cannabis because that

163
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,490
vocabulary tends to cause them to warm

164
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,379
up to faster because they can they can

165
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,139
tell that that you should have shared

166
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,730
past experience with them that's a

167
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,919
fantastic question when I founded

168
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,810
veterans is kind of saying what's

169
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,090
worrying I was worrying you know as the

170
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,740
Air Force and amber was in the Coast

171
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,810
Guard and people come from all different

172
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,639
branches when you need somebody with a

173
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,769
fellow service member you feel a little

174
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,349
almost an immediate connection you know

175
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:48,969
that they have something in common with

176
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,650
you that you don't have in common with

177
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,630
maybe your spouse your friends your

178
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:54,729
family it connects you almost

179
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:57,159
immediately same with cannabis when you

180
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,140
smoke that cannabis so we're able to

181
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,430
form a relationship built on trust

182
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,680
because we both know we were in the

183
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,269
service and then from there we're able

184
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,300
to take that a step further when we

185
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:09,430
start to talk about cannabis and just

186
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,170
talk about how was your military service

187
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,920
and sometimes veterans don't like to

188
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,870
open up because it's hard talking to

189
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,850
civilians or hard talking to people that

190
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,620
don't understand and then when a veteran

191
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,010
talks to another veteran nothing just

192
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,139
goes down and they can talk shop as it

193
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,879
were and say hey this is why I'm I'm

194
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,349
medicating these are the problems I've

195
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,350
had this is what it was like when I

196
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,360
deployed and with that it's really able

197
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,820
to break down that wall and get them to

198
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,379
talk about what how was that experience

199
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:40,060
for you because some people did

200
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:42,730
experience combat some people do have

201
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,129
PTSD depending on your service some

202
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,400
people that experience sexual trauma and

203
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,930
those are the

204
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,689
for being the airforce and working in

205
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,329
the medical field just being patient and

206
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,829
understanding and you know let's let

207
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:57,659
people talk about things in their own

208
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:58,379
time same thing like candidates well how

209
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,270
much do you smoke

210
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,040
call up the new smoke have you found

211
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:04,799
that this helps you and knowing the best

212
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,560
strains for you because with cannabis is

213
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,780
sometimes the THC can have too much of a

214
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,649
cerebral effect and that can actually

215
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:15,809
help to exacerbate this traumatic stress

216
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:17,310
disorder but depending on your know

217
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,259
cannabinoid system that might not be the

218
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,180
case so no other know what a sativa and

219
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,469
indica is going to be good for you why

220
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,689
are you medic and what are you trying to

221
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,970
medicate for and not medicating to

222
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:31,170
suppress your feelings but medicating so

223
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,668
that way you can you know start to form

224
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,139
a new relationship with how you feel

225
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:36,120
about those things kind of the past

226
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,620
those traumas identify them and use

227
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,659
cannabis to help you do that I know

228
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,179
we're really fun tearing this new

229
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,370
recreational you know market but I

230
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:47,750
always like to really emphasize the

231
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,980
importance of the plant-based medicine

232
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,539
thanks for joining us and over by here

233
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,980
I've already introduced you at the

234
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,959
beginning so let's already know who you

235
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,409
are know we're gonna we're gonna deal

236
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,050
you right in here so so the question is

237
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:04,259
you know with your background as

238
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:07,169
veteran of how are you able to leverage

239
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:11,159
that experience from the service to

240
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:13,169
better serve veterans here in the

241
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,969
cannabis industry and the goal we're

242
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:18,028
trying to get at is so other people can

243
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,310
emulate your experience and use their

244
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:23,850
experience in the military to also

245
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,599
provide aid to to their veteran

246
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,040
brothers-in-arms

247
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:33,720
sure so I was in ROTC kid as an artist

248
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:37,370
after high school officer training

249
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:42,019
program when I was in college so in

250
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:46,828
retrospect and I'm also a child of a

251
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:50,639
combat veteran my dad was in Vietnam he

252
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:53,009
got broken heart several times so I

253
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:57,208
definitely know firsthand even though I

254
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:59,669
got combat better at seeing PTSD from

255
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:05,099
you know someone very close to my dad

256
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:08,669
and don't say you know I've taken a lot

257
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,639
I mean obviously when I was a military I

258
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:12,958
got a ton of leadership training and

259
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:19,019
that's definitely helped me on campus

260
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:21,989
industry to kind of discuss and not just

261
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:25,578
discussed but I would say take a lot of

262
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:29,940
issues that are difficult for people to

263
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:33,208
comprehend or understand and bring those

264
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,279
issues to light I spy co-founded a

265
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:38,959
nonprofit organization called super dope

266
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:40,700
women and what we do is

267
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,110
we empower people of color to become

268
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,220
self-sufficient shareholders in the

269
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,169
cannabis industry

270
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:50,000
we do that through education advocacy

271
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:54,969
and networking lots of engaging with our

272
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,309
local and city city and state officials

273
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:02,028
hosting workshops for folks and things

274
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:04,789
like that so I would say that you know

275
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:08,689
even though my focus has been not

276
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:12,708
necessarily a veteran focus but more

277
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:16,899
women and people of color but a lot of

278
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:19,939
the the things that everything I learned

279
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:24,259
the training that I got in the military

280
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:29,330
has definitely helped me to push tough

281
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:33,708
agendas forward and also been I suffer

282
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:39,020
from lupus so I've been a very strong

283
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:40,539
patient advocate and I feel like you

284
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:44,208
know all of those things have really

285
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:48,519
helped me at least the the military's

286
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:51,469
don't need to get this game skills and

287
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,769
we helped to develop the skills that I

288
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,379
have to look like I just mentioned I

289
00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:02,659
push a lot of these issues at Jenna's

290
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:08,269
for as far as veterans in the military

291
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:11,778
and how I interact with them in cannabis

292
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:15,919
it's been really interesting there have

293
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:18,769
been my first interaction actually here

294
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,539
in the band moved here four years ago

295
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:23,240
and

296
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:24,939
to go to dispensary I work for an apples

297
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,409
company so I was running around

298
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,630
constantly visiting different

299
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:31,669
dispensaries and dispensary that a lot

300
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:37,129
of time that I remember was the Help

301
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:38,990
Center in any San Francisco and that

302
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:50,720
dispensary had ton of veterans that used

303
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:52,820
to camp in the area and bunch of

304
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,550
veterans used to just hang out there so

305
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,670
I would go there all the time and pass

306
00:12:55,549 --> 00:13:01,009
out edibles just three apples to all the

307
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:08,599
veterans and a really good friend of

308
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:14,299
mine also has a veteran's Richie D back

309
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:21,700
his name is ryan villa he's a veteran of

310
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:25,969
the Marine Corps and he hosts a like a

311
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:29,420
community take group at different

312
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,019
dispensaries real Bay Area and he

313
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:37,099
started actually had my dispensary uh

314
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:39,350
Magnolia here in West Oakland and yeah

315
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,750
it was just it's really interesting to

316
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,159
see how people are trying to help

317
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:52,580
ference within a cannabis community

318
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:53,740
obviously access to low-cost or free

319
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,920
[Music]

320
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:00,430
compassion medicine is is really

321
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,429
important

322
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:06,889
you know it's an interesting thing to

323
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,350
point out that you know after after

324
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,269
other Wars you know especially the wars

325
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,820
that our grandparents were in when

326
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,909
soldiers came back they had places like

327
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:19,340
the VFW halls to to meet at and and

328
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:22,370
slowly that that model it isn't quite as

329
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:26,420
robust as it was for generations before

330
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:29,029
us and in you know everywhere I travel

331
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:31,879
the country do you find all the huge

332
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:34,519
value that that's again from the

333
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,159
cannabis leverages me the cannabis

334
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,829
itself can help a whole range of

335
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,389
symptoms they may need relief from but

336
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:45,200
more importantly it provides that

337
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:47,360
gathering place where you can share

338
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,240
experiences with others and with people

339
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,879
that you trust and in in many ways it's

340
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,720
kind of it's supplanting with the with

341
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,889
the the VFW halls who did and this is

342
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,480
probably a little bit on the better side

343
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,689
cuz it's around cannabis and not booze

344
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,330
too yeah so so you're both leaders of

345
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,360
cannabis companies and also leaders

346
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:11,000
within your own cannabis scenes so I'm

347
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,289
curious to know what programs do either

348
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,629
your businesses have or other programs

349
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:22,549
that you are in your scenes that you

350
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:23,830
find work most effectively to reach out

351
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:26,019
to veterans

352
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,070
get them properly involved and oh and

353
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,720
just so you know where I'm going with

354
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,070
this is you know a lot of people we're

355
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,570
going to see the video and they're going

356
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,980
to feel inspired and they're going to

357
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,379
want to start doing things at their

358
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,480
local you know wherever they live in the

359
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:39,309
country right so my goal for this is for

360
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,560
for us to kind of you know put some

361
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:43,269
ideas in the ears of people in the

362
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,549
audience of what they might be able to

363
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:46,929
do where they live so what have you both

364
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:50,919
seen that that seems to be working

365
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:52,539
effectively thank you so if you want to

366
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:55,599
get veterans involved the best thing to

367
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:57,159
do is to go on a social media social

368
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,200
media is becoming huge whether it's

369
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:01,000
Facebook Instagram Twitter hashtag

370
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,040
veterans hash tag free hash tag

371
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,440
education and hash tag cannabis it's

372
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,509
gonna start to get some traction in New

373
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,880
England for the longest time veterans

374
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,919
didn't have any resources and that's

375
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,600
when some gaming Derrick Cloutier and

376
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,039
Shawn judge formed the New England

377
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,500
veterans alliance which has been

378
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,740
operational for the last two years they

379
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,360
are now a registered nonprofit

380
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,879
organization and what they started to do

381
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,649
is to hold monthly meetings where

382
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,379
veterans can come we can smell cannabis

383
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:31,000
we can relax enjoy each other and then

384
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:32,769
they've taken it a step further where

385
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,379
they reached out to me and they said hey

386
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:37,360
Allen you do education you're a veteran

387
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:40,269
come onboard so what I do is sometimes

388
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,580
I'll hold free educational classes for

389
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:45,699
veterans or the classes that I'll have I

390
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,560
will reach out to my network your

391
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,980
network is your network who do you know

392
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,329
what can they do so ever I reach out to

393
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,680
like magic butter or different seed

394
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,650
companies that have helped me out like

395
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:59,889
homegrown natural wonders and then

396
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,509
another one is the California sea falls

397
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,399
and they'll send me genetics and I'll

398
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:05,920
give them away to veterans for free as a

399
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,359
gift Thank You recreational use and now

400
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,100
I can gift things I couldn't do that

401
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,419
with the medical marijuana program

402
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,759
so now I can give

403
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,259
and then if I have a raffle for the

404
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,549
money that goes into the raffle I'll

405
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:17,709
take it and I'll give it right back to

406
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,750
that nonprofit organization and that's

407
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,279
in Massachusetts in Maine there's a

408
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,819
whole new growing healthcare of Maine

409
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,769
started by Catherine Lewis Glenn Lewis

410
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:29,439
and Shawn and what they do is they also

411
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:32,799
provide free classes for veterans what

412
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,230
free classes for veterans I myself hold

413
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,759
free classes for veterans in Connecticut

414
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,190
there's can a housing we're gonna start

415
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:40,960
holding monthly or quarterly free

416
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,240
classes so just by providing them

417
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,370
cannabis education providing them i've

418
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,589
discounts or giving them the tools and

419
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:50,979
resources they need to go further that

420
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:53,559
helps to strengthen your it helps to

421
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,910
strengthen your cannabis community and

422
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,589
helps to strengthen in the veteran

423
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,050
community so you don't have to be a

424
00:17:56,589 --> 00:18:02,049
veteran to help the veteran Katherine's

425
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:04,480
Shawna and Glen are not metrans that

426
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,190
they do see the need for it they see how

427
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,049
it has helped people so I could not be

428
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,480
more thankful to the New England

429
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:12,240
veterans alliance to the homegrown

430
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,200
healthcare Maine to Canton health for

431
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,900
recognizing that veterans don't have

432
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,420
anywhere to really go in states that

433
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,480
don't allow for lounges we don't have

434
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,370
any lounges we still have to go meet in

435
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,190
places and smoke and parking lots and

436
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,750
it's not conducive to helping us not

437
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,330
killing criminals or freaking that

438
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,039
stigma and getting us out so the more we

439
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:34,599
can do for veterans the more we can

440
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,569
offer our veterans to hell

441
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:39,609
then succeed on their own is going to be

442
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:41,950
priceless and here on the west coast do

443
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:43,629
you have twenty two two money which I

444
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,649
love nearing live actors Alliance and I

445
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,990
love all these different organizations

446
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:48,369
for twenty two too many and as a special

447
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,649
place in my heart because they were one

448
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:53,138
of the first they are so loud they are

449
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:55,329
so proud Patrick Shane is one of their

450
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:57,538
founders and they are always at the

451
00:18:55,329 --> 00:19:00,009
Washington State House they got PTSD

452
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:02,109
added to their medical marijuana program

453
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:05,048
in Massachusetts

454
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:06,219
so I mentioned Maine I mentioned mass I

455
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:08,528
mentioned Connecticut

456
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,509
there's the Tetra hydrophobe in Grove

457
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:12,369
Isle which has three days for veterans

458
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:14,440
and in New Hampshire there's not really

459
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:16,750
anything going on they don't have a

460
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,048
conducive medical program and they do

461
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,579
not have a recreational program so like

462
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:22,929
they have medical marijuana program they

463
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:24,878
didn't even have post-traumatic stress

464
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:26,470
disorder as a qualifying condition and

465
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:27,668
that's when all the veterans got

466
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,509
together and we said this is

467
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:31,509
unacceptable

468
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:33,639
and we went to their State House for one

469
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:37,599
of their hearings and we all testified

470
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:42,189
there were about ten of us and with our

471
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:44,589
voices with our service with our actual

472
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:47,230
stories it's not anecdotal evidence it

473
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:48,908
is my is my life and I need this

474
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,829
medicine and we were able to get

475
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:53,169
post-traumatic stress disorder added to

476
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:54,339
the state of New Hampshire which is huge

477
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,870
because on the East Coast they are

478
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:57,788
probably one of the furthest states back

479
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:00,158
for me where they need to be to have a

480
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:01,419
functional medical marijuana program and

481
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,940
they're so far from having a

482
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:05,528
recreational program so getting veterans

483
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,509
involved and especially getting the

484
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:10,359
veterans involved in lobbying is gonna

485
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:11,620
be huge Robbie and activism I had times

486
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,969
where people from different

487
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:17,009
organizations would call me and say hey

488
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,440
the Statehouse or I need you to test it

489
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:21,869
by X Y or Z and it's because you're

490
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,269
educated and also you're a veteran I

491
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:27,178
need a veteran voice because when I say

492
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:29,819
hi my name is Alan brown I'm a student

493
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:31,980
I'm a caregiver yeah yeah I'm the United

494
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,629
States veteran and that's when I notice

495
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,429
people who like this and I notice them

496
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,450
start to listen and you what did she

497
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:38,580
have to say when it's this young a

498
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,590
veteran you have to stay so by being a

499
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:43,199
veteran your your voice carries just a

500
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:46,139
little bit more weight or because you're

501
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,960
a veteran maybe somebody who wasn't as

502
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,570
active listening to all canvasses canvas

503
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,460
can't go into that room I love that term

504
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:55,200
okay what do you have to say and because

505
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,840
you are a veteran they'll take the time

506
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,340
to listen to you so make sure that you

507
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,769
know when you're speaking you're able to

508
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:02,879
articulate that it's helped you and what

509
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,288
it's going to be able to do for other

510
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,059
veterans because it's not just me taking

511
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:08,069
care of myself in Massachusetts New

512
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:10,500
England so I can carry the entire world

513
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:12,000
and every veteran who needs it before

514
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,079
you reply that same question amber

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,519
there's a couple important things I

516
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:17,158
think that are worth worth while to pull

517
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,139
out of that number one if you want to

518
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,559
start veterans programs in your area

519
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:25,890
don't be shy about asking for stuff

520
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:28,769
people want to help veterans so you know

521
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,090
whether or not you're gay free medical

522
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:32,849
marijuana for them whether or not you're

523
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:34,889
getting growing products or or tents for

524
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:36,959
them to grow in their homes whether or

525
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,450
not it's just access or pre tickets or

526
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,788
where tickets to you know an event or a

527
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,240
sports event or anything people want to

528
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:46,629
help veterans and

529
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,370
to decide that bearings in your area you

530
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:51,340
know there's there's there's there's not

531
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:53,289
many things that will attract sick

532
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:55,058
veterans better than letting them know

533
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:57,369
that there's going to be free cannabis

534
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:59,410
provided for them for their aches and

535
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:01,269
pains when they arrive and then once

536
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,980
they're there you can continue on with

537
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:05,349
the other services that you want to make

538
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,839
sure you give them the the therapy that

539
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:10,359
the community the information about

540
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,039
their health in cannabis and so there's

541
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,909
a lot of different ways to go about that

542
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,250
all good stuff

543
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,320
so same kind idea that you amber so so

544
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,130
you're in a different scene than Ellen

545
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:22,869
is and as you've already said your work

546
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,880
certainly touches on veterans but but

547
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:31,178
more specifically minorities and women

548
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:34,270
and and others who may may be even

549
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:37,480
farther out of the mainstream and have

550
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:39,519
even more unique needs so so what kind

551
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,620
of programs do you see being offered

552
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,269
that that you're finding to be effective

553
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:44,319
that other people might be able to model

554
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:47,049
elsewhere in the country

555
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:49,750
absolutely so as we mentioned before I

556
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:51,440
kind of talked about camaraderie is a

557
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,548
really big thing

558
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,230
the military developed some friendships

559
00:22:55,548 --> 00:23:00,138
and relationships that last for a

560
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,849
lifetime and these things are very

561
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:07,158
powerful you go through all kinds of

562
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:10,009
experiences together and that's really

563
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:14,409
important for people to get together and

564
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:18,740
discuss and share like that the VFW and

565
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:22,039
since those things as kind of dueling

566
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,808
away creating these support groups for

567
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:27,230
people to come together and share their

568
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:30,918
stories is very vital and very important

569
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:33,919
so groups like Operation evac like I've

570
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:36,620
mentioned before that that's a Bay Area

571
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,389
group they need a couple four

572
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:40,628
dispensaries in unit my sentence and

573
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:43,819
seven stars right here in Richmond and

574
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:46,969
they get together and just kind of

575
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:48,230
discuss and talk about the issues that

576
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,169
they're having and she said they're

577
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:56,480
facing and just you know being a veteran

578
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:59,480
and navigating civilian life and I think

579
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,970
that's really important just because you

580
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,720
know last these folks are very lonely

581
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:07,308
they might not get out for you know

582
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,490
whatever reason it could be health

583
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:14,778
issues it could be PTSD issues to be a

584
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:18,609
number of reasons supporting those types

585
00:24:14,778 --> 00:24:18,609
of groups is really important

586
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:26,219
we free canvas whetherthey money you

587
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:31,589
know here in California actually they

588
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:36,900
just passed an amendment to the

589
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:41,730
regulation of saying that some groups

590
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:44,130
like Operation evac can now have a

591
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:47,429
compassion program to turn around and

592
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:49,260
give veterans free cannabis and that was

593
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:52,470
something that we couldn't do before but

594
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:57,720
it was lobby for by the veterans you

595
00:24:52,470 --> 00:25:00,028
know so advocacy is he activism that

596
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,038
advocacy is really key in getting these

597
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:03,390
things I mean you know whoever thought

598
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,359
that they would have come out with

599
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:09,960
regulation saying can't get away

600
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:11,250
cannabis any more like come on so that

601
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,980
was really important but that only

602
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:18,089
happened because a veteran spoke up

603
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,839
about it also to go off of what I was

604
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:21,569
saying

605
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:24,538
Santa Cruz varmints Alliance is a really

606
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:27,119
great group in Santa Cruz I actually got

607
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:29,599
a chance to go down there and tour their

608
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,398
facilities and they meet those guys

609
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,829
there's about three weeks ago so that

610
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:35,979
was

611
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:38,109
awesome experience but it was one of the

612
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,149
nicest facilities I've ever been and

613
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:43,079
it's clean it's like oh yeah this is

614
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:46,268
they're ready for an inspection in here

615
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,980
and it's saw the best flower I've seen

616
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:50,319
it so the best prices I've seen you know

617
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,970
out the door eight for 45 bucks top

618
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,509
shelf like you're not finding it

619
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:57,909
anywhere else is a bit so you know just

620
00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:00,038
it also going to support those those

621
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:02,260
organizations simply Veterans Alliance

622
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:05,369
their dispensary to grow it's all its

623
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:08,710
run and supported by mainly FedEx and

624
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:11,319
it's really important for us to to

625
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,940
support those types of organizations is

626
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,609
why right on that's a good point

627
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,440
so so so if you're in the room and but

628
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,509
you don't live really local here to

629
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,580
California or if you are watching this

630
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:23,349
video after the event at home you know

631
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:25,658
you don't necessarily have to go to

632
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:27,879
Santa Cruz to learn from these groups go

633
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:30,070
online and google their names and you

634
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,440
know take a look at their flyers figure

635
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:34,629
out you know how they describe their

636
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,080
events with what vocabulary they learn

637
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:41,350
what they use you can learn from how

638
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,908
other groups advertised how you may want

639
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,859
to advertise to be able to reach your

640
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:48,460
particular audience so so up to this

641
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:52,148
point we've talked about about how as a

642
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,429
veteran those skills help you outreach

643
00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:56,648
to to all people but specifically

644
00:26:54,429 --> 00:27:00,100
veterans especially and then we turn

645
00:26:56,648 --> 00:27:03,278
turn that into okay so what kinds of

646
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:04,990
programs are beneficial for veterans and

647
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,849
so let's let's take that one step

648
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,919
farther because I know that veterans

649
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:12,808
themselves are very involved with

650
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,490
shaping how cannabis is evolving as in

651
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:16,470
history and so why don't we start with

652
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,019
the end of the Sun so amber you know

653
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:23,999
what are some of the roles that you have

654
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:26,669
seen veterans in in cannabis that they

655
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:28,409
are using their their experience and

656
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:31,440
skills they picked up in the service and

657
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:35,929
they are making major moves in canvas

658
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,929
and the idea here is to is to inspire

659
00:27:36,888 --> 00:28:39,498
this is a facility she's been working to

660
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:42,569
organize PLC people of color women

661
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:45,230
veterans and she's down in LA so I mean

662
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:48,990
there's a lot of veterans that are

663
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:52,200
taking lead and running companies you

664
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:54,899
know running companies in leadership

665
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,538
positions but you know that's no

666
00:28:54,898 --> 00:29:00,888
surprise and you veterans get the best

667
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:00,888
leadership training

668
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,450
so it sounds like you know veterans

669
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,579
should just not be shy about taking

670
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,100
their shop because whatever they're

671
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:13,539
interested in you take that with the

672
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:17,199
training that they've already acquired

673
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:19,839
and it will very likely pop them to the

674
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,910
top of their scene because a lot of the

675
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,799
folks who are coming from you know other

676
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,810
scenes may not have that kind of

677
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:28,779
training they don't and they don't share

678
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:30,909
the same values now when I start

679
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:40,960
assigning values and stuff some people

680
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:44,259
laugh at me I think of courage devotion

681
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,970
to duty respect all these things like I

682
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:47,349
mean I carry that throughout everything

683
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,610
that I do and I've learned all these

684
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:53,799
core values when I was in the military

685
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:55,029
yeah I mean it's just like who wants to

686
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:57,309
get these core values in your

687
00:29:55,029 --> 00:30:00,579
corporation into everyday life how can

688
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:02,649
you not really so I'm going to change

689
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:04,990
the questions a little bit for you so so

690
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,540
you know we just talked about how you

691
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:10,210
know the kind of leadership veterans

692
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:15,009
generally are but I know that both of

693
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:17,890
you are very focused on giving female

694
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:20,470
veterans the the resources the

695
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:23,380
connections the introductions sometimes

696
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:26,559
probably just the encouragement to go

697
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:29,350
for it and so for folks who are very

698
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,079
interested in helping you know promote

699
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:34,659
female veterans in the cannabis scene

700
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,470
what are some of the programs that you

701
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,060
have seen nationally that see

702
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,059
they're doing that that looks like

703
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:44,000
anything locally where they what's

704
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:46,879
interesting is I have not seen any just

705
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,009
primarily female focused advocacy groups

706
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,620
they kind of there's a little bit of a

707
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:53,329
wave and then there's kind of a die-off

708
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:55,639
that kids make them about 7% of the

709
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:58,129
population female veterans are probably

710
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,140
2% of that percentage so it's a small

711
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,290
percent of a small percent for example

712
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,300
with this panel burr you know females in

713
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:07,369
the candidates and just industry as well

714
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:09,710
as veterans I put something on social

715
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:12,229
media saying I'd love to get some more

716
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,480
female that turns a lot and the old and

717
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,029
I'm still glad in riskier and anger who

718
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,339
amber was one of the only veterans who

719
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:21,259
was a female veteran there are plenty of

720
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:23,179
male veterans in the cannabis space and

721
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:25,910
then she was a woman of color here in

722
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:29,000
California it was perfect but it was

723
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:31,009
amber and then when it's an online

724
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,930
everybody had maybe one person two

725
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:34,849
people they could name but you couldn't

726
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,680
couldn't name like 1015 like remember

727
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:38,809
women in a row that are female cannabis

728
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,029
advocates so with that in mind I

729
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:42,919
definitely think there's a need and even

730
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:46,129
going through it I realize I don't have

731
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:49,279
a roster of female veterans I could call

732
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:51,350
on Andrew now honor but no knowing who

733
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,269
you're who your female veterans are than

734
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:56,029
what they advocate for for examples

735
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:57,379
there's a meet Monique and she is a

736
00:31:56,029 --> 00:31:59,899
breast cancer survivor

737
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,260
she's down in Southern California and

738
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,480
she started an ich where so she does

739
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:07,539
of apparel and then gives back to

740
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,029
veterans in that way there is Sarah

741
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:11,769
softner and what she does is she's an

742
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:15,819
advocate in New York City and she just

743
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:18,190
got a license to cultivate I know so she

744
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:20,349
got a farm and she's gonna start putting

745
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,660
the other programs for veterans to come

746
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:25,509
and cultivate to have a place to talk to

747
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:28,120
have a place to be able to learn a skill

748
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:30,759
set and then be also I have enough

749
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:32,079
family and a purpose and not that they

750
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:34,029
don't have a purpose now and some

751
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,439
veterans once they get out of the

752
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:36,819
service and go back in the civilian

753
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,009
world they could be kind of isolate

754
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:40,659
themselves very much so they don't even

755
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:43,329
know where to start so having programs

756
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,890
like what Sarah is going to put together

757
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:46,629
is going to be crucial for getting

758
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,850
people back out of the house helping

759
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,230
them react remain and when she's

760
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:51,939
starting to put together their programs

761
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,890
she called me and she said Ellen I need

762
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,870
help with Braille classes so I'm gonna

763
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,340
be facilitating those girl classes and

764
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:58,809
if we need business we're gonna call it

765
00:32:57,339 --> 00:32:59,919
we're in a choleric friend amber and if

766
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:03,009
you need apparel we're gonna call

767
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,900
Monique so within the canvas community

768
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:06,819
the female veterans are kind of starting

769
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,250
to figure out who each other who we are

770
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:11,250
what skill sets we have and how do we

771
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,720
work together because there's absolutely

772
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,150
strength in numbers and there's

773
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,539
definitely strengths when we have a

774
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:21,250
unifying voice unified got to voice

775
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,490
whether or not it's just females or

776
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,809
males are all together we're unstoppable

777
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,400
when we get together and we put our

778
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:29,019
minds to something I really love time

779
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,870
you brought out the core values in the

780
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:33,879
Air Force our core values are integrity

781
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:35,349
first service support self and

782
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,780
excellence and all we do and I

783
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:39,809
absolutely carry

784
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:42,829
values over into my canvas work I want

785
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:45,240
to make sure that there is that idea of

786
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:48,059
integrity first I'm not telling you

787
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,529
better ins come to these classes and you

788
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:52,559
know you'll take that cannabis and it'll

789
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:54,899
cure your PTSD absolutely not I tell

790
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,490
about their own economic system dosing I

791
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,050
give them resources so they're able to

792
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:02,069
better take care of themselves with the

793
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:04,200
service before itself it's not about

794
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:06,419
promoting Ellen Brown it's about

795
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,970
promoting the cannabis the industry the

796
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:11,070
veterans so making sure that the the

797
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:14,549
focal point of everything I'm doing is

798
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:19,769
to not to highlight myself but to

799
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:21,840
highlight the cause and excellent

800
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:24,168
service for self access how we do and

801
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,940
just making sure those core values have

802
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:28,888
really really stayed firm I think that

803
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,898
once you go into the military I don't

804
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,378
know what the other core values are for

805
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:35,078
the Coast Guard memories

806
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:37,210
we all kind of have an amount of

807
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:39,609
camaraderie where we know that we've all

808
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,460
been taught to do the right thing in

809
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:44,528
such a way that it's it's integral it's

810
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,568
actually a part of who I am and a part

811
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:48,849
of the way I address people I carry

812
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:50,378
myself and when you need another veteran

813
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:51,429
discussion or the female veteran you

814
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:53,469
know what you can almost always tell

815
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:56,128
it's our posture but when you fold

816
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:59,108
ourselves when you sit up straight and

817
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:01,150
by the way that we we take the time and

818
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:02,978
we're passionate you can see how amber

819
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,588
has so much passion for what she does

820
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:07,298
she's a a female veteran and then she

821
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:09,548
takes a step further and she goes well

822
00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:11,798
how can I help oh my minority they don't

823
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:13,449
brothers-in-arms help this happening

824
00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:16,179
within this so she found that business

825
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:19,210
was the best avenue for her and I found

826
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:21,159
that education and advocacy has been my

827
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,900
best Avenue to really help to propel

828
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:25,088
those other veterans and to get them

829
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,338
where they need to be

830
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:29,349
Metron is usually a very self-sufficient

831
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:31,478
they don't need a lot but once you have

832
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:33,130
that support system and you feel

833
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:34,058
unstoppable and you kind of become

834
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,039
unstoppable

835
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:38,140
everybody thrives with more support

836
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:39,579
that's for certain you know something

837
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,440
that's really interesting that came out

838
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:44,829
there is that you knowing so much of the

839
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,950
cannabis industry there are more people

840
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:49,690
than there are opportunities there's

841
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:51,248
there's more people who want but tender

842
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,499
jobs that can get them there's more

843
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:55,838
people who are running businesses then

844
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:56,919
there is room for those businesses and

845
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,558
our industry is gonna have quite a

846
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:03,759
shakeout but from what I'm hearing if

847
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:06,999
you are a woman veteran there's a dearth

848
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:09,500
of you in the industry and so you should

849
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,848
feel encouraged not

850
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,039
oh my gosh all your friends are saying

851
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:15,260
there's other jobs in the industry or or

852
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:18,710
or there's no room for you to start a

853
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:20,750
company just the opposite I've clearly

854
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,849
there are resources available to you

855
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:26,300
people want you to play in the sandbox

856
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:28,099
and and likelihood of sharing the place

857
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,320
because it's not only that I'm sorry to

858
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:34,010
interrupt you but a lot of businesses

859
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,140
are incentivized to hire veterans I need

860
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:39,410
to know that if you're applying for a

861
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:41,210
dispensary license in Merced which is in

862
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:46,639
Central Valley in California get extra

863
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:51,679
points if they're under the industry is

864
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:54,469
coming hip to how the issues at their

865
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,469
hands face how their hands need to be

866
00:36:54,469 --> 00:37:03,049
included in the industry and figuring

867
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:04,969
out some pretty creative ways to write

868
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,980
on so just raise your hand and then

869
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:09,618
expect to be aggressively recruited so

870
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:12,019
those less inspiring things so so we're

871
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:13,309
reaching the end of our time we probably

872
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:15,858
have time for one more question

873
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:18,108
but do we have a question from the

874
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:22,519
audience that anybody wants to give our

875
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:23,598
panel before we wrap up no so not

876
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:24,980
immediately and that have sometimes

877
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,960
happens with morning good morning

878
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,849
everybody's still tucked into their

879
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,338
coffee so so let's end with one more

880
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:33,980
question just about for the veterans who

881
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:36,739
have been listening to the panel today

882
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,880
and you know you've shaken some things

883
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,989
loose for them right there's something

884
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,390
to seeing though maybe there's some

885
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:43,358
opportunity for me either to you know

886
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:46,789
participate in the cannabis industry

887
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:48,980
either starting a company or working on

888
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:51,679
a team of a company or maybe they just

889
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,480
want to go over one of these lands

890
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,299
experiences that you're describing where

891
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:00,139
they can they can meet people with

892
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,490
shared experiences and learn how can

893
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:04,960
helped their inner camera system which

894
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:07,459
in turn helps everything what are some

895
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:12,010
simple first steps that they can take

896
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:18,409
now to help open those doors really just

897
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:22,400
get involved you know there are support

898
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:23,779
groups and just be present yeah a lot of

899
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,920
people ask how can they get into the

900
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,860
industry

901
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,889
what can I begin and really just just

902
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:35,539
show up you know 15 seconds on Google

903
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:37,329
may be all it takes for veterans don't

904
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:39,980
want to get into the cannabis industry

905
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:41,960
there is no barrier there is absolutely

906
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,849
no governing body there is nobody

907
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,429
necessarily really in charge of this

908
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:48,589
every state govern ourselves very

909
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:50,539
uniquely so there could be opportunities

910
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,550
that are available to you in some states

911
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:55,730
more than other states and in the state

912
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:57,710
I primarily think of the south and the

913
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:59,840
Midwest is just being so very far behind

914
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,280
it's like the coastal states really got

915
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,559
it going on and then in the middle we

916
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,260
need all this help so getting those

917
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,789
veterans to come out and say I mean I'm

918
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,890
the United States Air Force veteran

919
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:11,989
I need cannabis I needed for my

920
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,549
medicinal purposes and I also needed in

921
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:15,709
a recreational market because it's a

922
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:18,950
multi-million dollar industry that I

923
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:20,980
want to be a part of and something that

924
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:22,449
we have really touched on is

925
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,599
that things need to get together to be

926
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:26,679
very vocal because we need to get canvas

927
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,349
to not be a Schedule one substance

928
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:31,179
anymore and now Savannah you need to

929
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:33,250
make products federally and I feel like

930
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:36,460
the federal government is a lot more apt

931
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:38,440
to hear the voices of veterans talk

932
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,260
about lightening unit for medicinal uses

933
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,108
for to probably sales in their

934
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,340
businesses and our voices I really

935
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:47,679
believe in what's going to help to

936
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,289
create that much-needed paradigm shift

937
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,699
so that way cannabis can be there for

938
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:53,590
everybody who needs it especially those

939
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:55,439
veterans we do not get cannabis

940
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:57,250
prescribed to us by the VA we get

941
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,309
pharmaceuticals subscribe to the VA

942
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:04,000
we're losing 22 veterans a day to being

943
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:05,889
overprescribed if we lost as many people

944
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,679
in congress as we do veterans will they

945
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:12,339
be gone in 25 days we're losing veterans

946
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:15,309
as staggering alarming unacceptable

947
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,119
number and getting them involved and

948
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:18,029
getting them away from those

949
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:20,619
pharmaceutical to let you know about

950
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:23,109
alternative health is going to help to

951
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:26,800
save their lives so it really is that

952
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:27,969
morning well thank you both for sharing
