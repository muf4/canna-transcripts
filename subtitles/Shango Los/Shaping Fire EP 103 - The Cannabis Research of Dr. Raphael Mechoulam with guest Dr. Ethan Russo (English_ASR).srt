2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,179
it is truly humbling to read or hear

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,000
about a human who totally defines an

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,820
area of life that their biography is

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,640
indistinguishable from a discipline that

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,719
their history is also the history of an

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,260
art

8
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:27,778
Dr Rafael mishulum is one such person

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,640
Dr michulum was a Titan of cannabis

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,340
research and his breakthroughs were

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,159
breakthroughs for all of us his setbacks

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,140
set all of cannabis science back and his

13
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,058
successes were to the benefit of all

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,120
Humanity

15
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:44,699
today's episode is unique on shaping

16
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,159
fire we don't do company profiles or

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,460
product profiles or cannabis personality

18
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,439
profiles we always focus on a topic and

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,878
then I curate a guest who is an expert

20
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,979
in that area

21
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,619
shaping fire is always in service of

22
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,898
Education instead of cannabis business

23
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,640
but today is different today we're going

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,400
to look back on the life's work of Dr

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,319
Rafael mashulum and in doing so you will

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,840
not only get an idea of the expansive

27
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,639
work and discoveries of Dr michulum but

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,978
at the same time you will get a really

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,319

30
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,060

biographies you'll likely find that your

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,020
interest in cannabis medicine and the

34
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,060
history of our favorite plant is plenty

35
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,699

joining me today for this very special

119
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,479
topic I know you and Dr mishulum were

120
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,460
very close

121
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,500
um so to get us started for context

122
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:37,198
would you give us a little bit about

123
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,079
your relationship with him before we get

124
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,600
started looking at his career just so

125
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,159
people know from what perspective you're

126
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,240
you're speaking

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,780
uh sure so I knew of him by reputation a

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,019
long time before but we actually met for

129
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:57,299
the first time in 1999 at the

130
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:01,859
international cannabinoid research

131
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:04,020
society meeting in Acapulco Mexico

132
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,040
um so this is the first time we had to

133
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:11,639
the opportunity to meet one-on-one on

134
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:15,960
you know uh Chit Chat uh he recognized

135
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,340
my name as one that could be an Israeli

136
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:20,399
name

137
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:23,478
um and uh I knew that he had been born

138
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:27,418
to a Sephardic Jewish Family in Bulgaria

139
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:30,899
and pointed out to him that my father's

140
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:34,399
family had come from nearby in what is

141
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:37,799
now North Macedonia a town called

142
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:41,538
Monastery then currently called bitala

143
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:47,460
so there was an immediate Rapport there

144
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:49,860
also I was afforded uh some respect

145
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:53,399
beyond that which I had earned at that

146
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,340
time by virtue of being a physician who

147
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:59,638
was interested in cannabis in the

148
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,859
endocannabinoid system so that was a bit

149
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,160
of a rarity then

150
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:09,919
um and uh it it gave me a little bit of

151
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:13,080
an edge in people taking me seriously

152
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:15,359
so um I know that um you know I'm going

153
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,120
to ask you a lot of questions today

154
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,639
um kind of asking you what Dr mushulum

155
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,978
thought of this or that and I know it's

156
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,439
like like it's a hard thing to speak for

157
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,599
somebody else but you worked with him so

158
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,279
much over the years and and we're also

159
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,340
you know kind of social even even family

160
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,559
friends I think it's fair to say that um

161
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:37,138
you were pretty familiar with his

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,379
thoughts on both medicine and you know

163
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,240
the world writ large so so I know that

164
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,339
some of the questions are gonna will be

165
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,620
more challenging for others because it

166
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:47,638
kind of asks you to say what Dr michulum

167
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,918
thought

168
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,840
um so so I appreciate the extra effort

169
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,698
you need to put into that and I also

170
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,138
appreciate that

171
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,720
um you know you're speaking for somebody

172
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,400
else and so uh if if I come across

173
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,780
something that you're like you know uh I

174
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,519
don't I don't think I I would know what

175
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:05,459
he would have to say uh feel free to

176
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:08,099
just move me on sure it's a

177
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:11,459
responsibility but one I take on

178
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,220
willingly excellent good thank you so so

179
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,859
let's start um what initially inspired

180
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,720
Dr michulum to study cannabis and its

181
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,460
compounds and and how did he become

182
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,699
interested in the field

183
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,680
well I think he nicely explained this in

184
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:30,180
a resource I think all your listeners

185
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,879
would uh be a very find very worthwhile

186
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,660
to take an hour and see the film online

187
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:39,180
at YouTube called The Scientist so if

188
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,660
they enter the scientist and Raphael

189
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,079
mishulum they'll find this

190
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:48,660
but to answer your question uh it was

191
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,719
pretty clear to him he he seemed to be

192
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,199
the kind of person that uh wanted to do

193
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,440
something novel and important

194
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,740
um because of his good education he was

195
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:05,699
well aware of the fact that cannabis had

196
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,319
remained a mystery for at least 150

197
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,740
years

198
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:14,419
um for example uh morphine was isolated

199
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,639
from the Opium poppy Circa 1804

200
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:21,538
similarly cocaine was identified from

201
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:24,060
coca leaves in the 19th century but try

202
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:27,719
as they may scientists around the world

203
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:31,079
were unable to really get isolation of

204
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,778
the quote active ingredient unquote of

205
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,838
cannabis on the 19th century there was

206
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:39,860
some isolation of a red oil they called

207
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:43,979
cannabinol but it wasn't quite uh right

208
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:46,759
so he wanted to try to figure out what

209
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,800
cannabis had in it

210
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,720
and it just wasn't something that people

211
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,240
were paying attention to in the early

212
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,759
1960s

213
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,080
so that was it

214
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,399
um and it wasn't an easy thing to do

215
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,860
um you know there were some real

216
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,500
challenges that he faced

217
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,259
yeah I can imagine not only you know

218
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,519
you're describing how um how this you

219
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,319
know scientists around the world were

220
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,080
having a hard time isolating things but

221
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,540
of course it was all it was all you know

222
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,940
very much uh illegal internationally too

223
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:23,338
and comparatively it's relatively easy

224
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,380
to research cannabis during you know

225
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,720
this kind of creeping normalization that

226
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,759
we're experiencing right now uh a lot

227
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,700
different than when Dr michulum began

228
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,620
his research in the 1960s so so what

229
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,080
were those challenges that Dr Michelle

230
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,620
faced in his research due to the fact

231
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,720
that it was you know not only not legal

232
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,278
most places but it was also demonized

233
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,839
worldwide at the best of the United

234
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:51,419
States yes absolutely so at the time

235
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:56,040
um cannabis was by no means widespread

236
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:59,699
in Israel in fact early uh Supply uh

237
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:02,278
came from Lebanon uh the way I

238
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,080
understand it uh people on the Lebanese

239
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,799
side would come to the edge of the

240
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:11,160
border and and throw the parcel of

241
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,439
hashish over the barbed wire to someone

242
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,659
on the other side presumably with an

243
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,940
exchange of cash

244
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:20,278
um but there were seizures of hashish

245
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,279
and so that's where it got its Supply it

246
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:28,679
was initially from the police uh he tell

247
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:33,019
used to tell a very funny story about uh

248
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:36,899
uh getting help to uh go to the police

249
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:39,179
and uh requesting five kilos of hash

250
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,159
which he put in his briefcase and got on

251
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,819
a public bus

252
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:46,439
um and uh became quite a difference

253
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,079
apparently in route but at the time

254
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,500
people just didn't recognize the smell

255
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:55,259
he figured out subsequently uh that what

256
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,659
he had done was illegal on both sides

257
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:00,740
and that in future he had to go through

258
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:03,480
the police to get a supply of hashish

259
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,519
but basically from their first five

260
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,959
kilos of of hashish they used the latest

261
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,139
techniques to get a separation of

262
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:15,778
different components and

263
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:18,659
found isolated uh identified the

264
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:23,039
structure of THC and also synthesized it

265
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:26,179
in Novo that was in 1964. prior to that

266
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:29,278
in 1963

267
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:31,639
they had found cannabidiol so

268
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,980
cannabidiol was actually first

269
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:38,699
but shortly thereafter we can go through

270
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:43,620
a whole list of other discoveries that

271
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:45,420
came from those initial investigations

272
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,060
um before we move forward I have a side

273
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:51,419
question on uh him getting his uh

274
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,458
research supply of hash from the police

275
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,039
um you know I I have seen how

276
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:57,599
traditional hash is made in Lebanon and

277
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,399
and you describe them you know chucking

278
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,159
it over the fence

279
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,100
um I imagine that you know the hash that

280
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:08,399
was being gotten from the police was you

281
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,420
know was dirty and maybe had other you

282
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,179
know

283
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:14,338
items and hairs and straw from wherever

284
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:16,620
it was made or whatever did that really

285
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,420
matter with this kind of molecular

286
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,799
research because you're you're going to

287
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,958
do an isolation and just pull out the

288
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,539
parts anyway or or was that was it

289
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,699
harder to work with that kind of uh

290
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:28,559
product yeah no you're right it

291
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,620
absolutely had to be there'd be all

292
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:35,578
these impurities in one way or another

293
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:38,519
um you'd have to get through the crudity

294
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:41,278
of the initial material to get down to

295
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,100
the isolates of the compounds of

296
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,659
Interest so I have no doubt it was more

297
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,079
technically difficult

298
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,958
yeah I can believe that so so in 1963 Dr

299
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:54,078
michulum started researching

300
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:57,479
tetrahydrocannabinol AK THC specifically

301
00:12:54,078 --> 00:13:00,059
would you explain how he suspected it

302
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,000
was present and the process by which he

303
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:05,219
discovered and isolated it

304
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,700
um yeah basically they use separation

305
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,759
columns but you know in terms of it was

306
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,820
well well known that uh hashish and

307
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:18,120
cannabis were psychoactive and it was a

308
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,940
matter of identifying which compound or

309
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,799
compounds were responsible and that

310
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,779
includes

311
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:31,019
um a series of steps of fractionation

312
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:35,879
and then fractionation again to get down

313
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:39,839
to the uh pure compound hopefully that

314
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:42,360
really is responsible for the activity

315
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,000
um you know at that time our testing

316
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,120
would have to be done in animals and

317
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,519
they use monkeys for better or worse for

318
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,980
a lot of the initial work

319
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,459
um but uh you know they they found so

320
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:00,659
many things that wasn't just THC uh also

321
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:03,778
in 1964 they isolated cannabigirol

322
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:06,958
um they published on that uh with his

323
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:11,220
his partner yahil gayoni

324
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:13,799
um and um even at the time I you know in

325
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,399
Reading Professor michulum's old work

326
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:20,939
I'm just struck with oppressions that he

327
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,799
had his predictions about things uh very

328
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,899
quickly they identified that

329
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,120
cannabigirol had to be the parent

330
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,000
compound

331
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,578
to THC and CBD

332
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,839
but that same year they identified the

333
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:39,059
acid cannabinoids which ultimately were

334
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,519
identified later as the the actual

335
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:43,338
parent compounds

336
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,519
um in the fresh plant before

337
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:49,980
decarboxylation on then in 66 they found

338
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,959
canaba chromine and then there were a

339
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,440
whole bunch of minors like cannabis

340
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,119
cyclol uh but they didn't stop there and

341
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,480
this is one of the things I would always

342
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,440
appreciated about Rafi was he was a

343
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,839
chemist

344
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,079
most chemists are happy to stay in their

345
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,300
Lane that was never enough for him he

346
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,519
always wanted to knew more what was the

347
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:16,139
biological function how can we figure

348
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:19,560
out what this does so by 1970 they had

349
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:22,820
tested all of these compounds and

350
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:26,819
basically found that

351
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:30,660
THC was mostly responsible and they made

352
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:34,079
an important distinction even today uh

353
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:36,480
you know some 60 years later almost

354
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:40,319
um people make the mistake of saying

355
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,199
that CBD or CBG or not psychoactive this

356
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,139
is absolutely wrong both of them are

357
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,819
what they should say is they're

358
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:51,000
non-intoxicating but Back in 1970

359
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,720
Professor mushroom knew that and he said

360
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,100
that these other substances were not

361
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,040
psychotomimetic which was a fancy way of

362
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,899
saying that they didn't make you crazy

363
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:03,778
when you took them

364
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,159
um and that was true throughout his

365
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:08,698
career

366
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:11,338
um again he did not confine himself to

367
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:16,740
the lab and was heavily involved in

368
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:19,440
clinical Pursuits with his discoveries

369
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,320
um you said that he discovered

370
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,839
um cannabidiol before THC when he

371
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,720
started looking at kanabit Isle was his

372
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,980
first thought that that might be uh the

373
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,680
substance that was taught causing

374
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,199
intoxication and it wasn't

375
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,299
yeah I I don't think so there had been

376
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,778
some prior work actually done in the

377
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:41,219
United States by uh German Refugee named

378
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:45,600
Lo

379
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:51,778
um and cannabidiol had been

380
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:54,240
um identified almost perfectly in 1940

381
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:56,419
um but they didn't nail down the actual

382
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,198
three-dimensional structure until

383
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:03,899
professor micholum in 1963

384
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,019
um so you know they're in science

385
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,519
they're often these incremental

386
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:10,019
developments and we'd have to say that

387
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,298
that was one of them

388
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:15,599
so from the timeline that you set up of

389
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:17,459
of the different Labs uh discovering the

390
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,139
different cannabinoids and and figuring

391
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,600
out their structure and isolating them

392
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,640
it sounds like

393
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,578
um you know this time between you know

394
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,299
1960 in the early 70s it was like bang

395
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:31,500
bang bang one cannabinoid after another

396
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,660
and you know that must have been not

397
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,519
only like an exciting time to be doing

398
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,058
this initial research to finally kind of

399
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:43,019
like crack the you know cannabis secret

400
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:45,298
um but also you know THC was something

401
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,839
that that people could immediately tell

402
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:51,839
there was going to be medicinal use for

403
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:55,199
what was the significance like both in

404
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,399
science but also perhaps in society writ

405
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
large

406
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,679
um what was the significance of the

407
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,200
discovery of THC and impact at that time

408
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,320
well I'd like to take this on a couple

409
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,319
of levels I mean the its first notoriety

410
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,178
came as an intoxicant

411
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,058
um certainly

412
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:18,059
um again being an extremely educated and

413
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:21,178
well-read person Professor Michelin was

414
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:23,099
very familiar with medicinal uses of

415
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,620
cannabis throughout the ages and I'm

416
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:31,019
sure that the wheels were turning with

417
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:33,239
him uh very uh very quickly but

418
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,220
um people have to understand how

419
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,538
earth-shattering

420
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:43,620
um these discoveries were for example

421
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:46,679
most uh most psychoactive drugs prior to

422
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:49,319
this time were alkaloids so they were

423
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,538
water-soluble substances the

424
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:54,960
cannabinoids were absolutely a different

425
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:58,379
kettle of fish because they were lipid

426
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,380
soluble and not alkaloids I mean you

427
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:05,580
know they had no nitrogen in them so

428
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:08,700
this really was a bit strange and it

429
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,439
made the material very hard to handle

430
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,419
um you know we usually dissolve things

431
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,298
in water and

432
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:17,700
um you know instead you have these lipid

433
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:20,038
soluble sticky substances they're

434
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,100
sticking onto the glassware and

435
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,259
everything else it's never been easy to

436
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:26,759
work with this stuff

437
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:32,038
um yeah

438
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:35,099
uh but and again he he quickly pivoted

439
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:38,700
into looking at uh clinical indications

440
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:40,798
and probably the first one that really

441
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,779
came to the four

442
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:48,599
um was uh the idea of cannabidiol as an

443
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:49,500
anti-convulsant uh so you know at this

444
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,019
time

445
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,679
um he was isolating these different

446
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:58,259
components from hashish and sharing them

447
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,480
with other scientists and uh there was a

448
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:03,179
great collaboration between the Israelis

449
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,679
and the Brazilian scientists

450
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:10,320
um uh doctors cunya and Carlini on 1980

451
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,798
they published the first clinical study

452
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:17,099
of cannabidiols and anticonvulsant

453
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:19,558
um in nine patients and very successful

454
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:23,038
and you know I would point out that

455
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:26,519
these were all people that had failed

456
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,619
treatment with available drugs at that

457
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,660
time time

458
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:33,000
now people may be really struck by the

459
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,860
fact that was 1980 we didn't get

460
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,319
approval of cannabidiol as an

461
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:40,500
anti-convulsant as epidiolics in this

462
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:43,038
country until 2018

463
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,339
um so there was this huge gap of time

464
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:51,359
that he was very uh surprised and

465
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:53,819
outraged by that this work had gone on

466
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,119
had shown such great promise and yet got

467
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:59,159
ignored for all that time

468
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,139
this might be as much of a question

469
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,419
about the scientific method as it is

470
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,020
about Dr mashulum but

471
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:09,840
um what about cannabidiol

472
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:12,440
um caused Dr mashulum to air quotes

473
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,939
suspect that cannabidiol was an

474
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,798
anti-convulsant was there something in

475
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,440
the nature or something that he had seen

476
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,379
and people who who used hashish or or

477
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,798
was it the the structure of the molecule

478
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,960
itself that he could look at and

479
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,720
envision how that would interact with

480
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,538
the human body no I'm really going to

481
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,880
attribute to his open-mindedness what I

482
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:40,279
mean by that was he was very aware of

483
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,620
historical

484
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:45,899
references to cannabis as an

485
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,279
anticonvulsant coming from the Arab

486
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,880
world

487
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:53,658
um and these dated back many centuries

488
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,400
um so there was a suspicion that hashish

489
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:59,039
could work as an anti-convulsant and

490
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,500
then it was a matter of seeing what

491
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,960
component or components might be

492
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,419
responsible

493
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,880
and why he honed in on cannabidiol

494
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:11,640
probably was because

495
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,480
um uh they were aware at that time that

496
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,120
it wouldn't be intoxicating

497
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,460
uh and uh so it would have an advantage

498
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,819
if it worked uh it wouldn't have the

499
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,919
liability that can be attached to THC

500
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:28,859
now we we still experience that

501
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,360
difference even today sure

502
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:33,298
um so

503
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:36,058
I talk with a lot of research scientists

504
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:38,599
uh on shaping fire and more or less they

505
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:41,460
fall into three different groups

506
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:42,839
scientists that study and intoxicating

507
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,100
substance

508
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,839
um but they they never touch it

509
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,519
themselves because they are they are not

510
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,678
the kind of person who enjoys

511
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,779
intoxicants and then in the middle

512
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,900
you've you've got scientists that you

513
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:57,058
know don't use whatever it is regularly

514
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,759
um but they have used it to understand

515
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:02,099
what the Human Experience is and then

516
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:05,640
you've got researchers that research

517
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:08,519
drugs and they like using them as well

518
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,159
um did Dr mishulum use cannabis or have

519
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:13,859
any personal appreciation for it uh I'm

520
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:18,419
gonna have to equivocate a bit

521
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:22,319
um he would tell a story of first human

522
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:25,320
experiences in in trying THC

523
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,899
um and it went something like this they

524
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:31,980
had invited friends and colleagues so to

525
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:34,400
a dinner party and his wife Dahlia was a

526
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,339
is a wonderful person

527
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,798
had made a cake

528
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:43,379
and there were portions of 10 milligrams

529
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,658
of THC I think that there were 10 people

530
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,159
involved

531
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:52,860
five didn't show any obvious effects

532
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:54,080
five did one an anxiety reaction the

533
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:58,079
others

534
00:23:54,079 --> 00:24:01,740
felt something or felt different in ways

535
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,439
that you might imagine uh one

536
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,140
um it said nothing had happened but was

537
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,240
laughing outrageously every few minutes

538
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,620
and another one said nothing happened

539
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,659
but never stop talking so you can draw

540
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,879
your own conclusions what he didn't say

541
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:20,580
in relating this story was whether he

542
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,460
was one of the ten but I imagine he was

543
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:26,579
I can attest to the fact that he was not

544
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,400
a regular user of cannabis right on

545
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:31,740
thank you for that story that's great so

546
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,840
um another key cannabinoid that uh Dr

547
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,700
Michelle miscredited for and we haven't

548
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,740
brought up yet is is actually one of my

549
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,279
favorites uh anandamide and he

550
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:44,159
discovered it in 1992. would you tell us

551
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,440
about the discovery of anandamide and

552
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,820
what it meant for endocannabinoid

553
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,820
Science and kind of patient Health

554
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:54,178
generally sure yeah I think we just have

555
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:56,639
to back up a little bit to 2018.

556
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:59,580
um so at that time uh William Devane in

557
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,500
the lab of a Lynn how lat at St Louis

558
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:05,038
University

559
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,319
um had discovered a cannabinoid receptor

560
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:11,339
so and I'm going to back up a little

561
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:15,240
more prior to that time uh people had no

562
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:18,439
idea how THC worked the working theory

563
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,480
was that it somehow

564
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:25,679
disrupted the membranes of the neurons

565
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:29,759
and the way that alcohol ethanol does

566
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:32,580
um but there were synthetic cannabinoids

567
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,158
that were being made and these were

568
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:38,278
stereo selective that's a way of saying

569
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,880
that if the molecule had one

570
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:43,980
configuration in three-dimensional space

571
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,020
it it worked it was intoxicating however

572
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,778
if it didn't have the right one it

573
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:50,700
didn't work that implied that there must

574
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:51,599
be a receptor where the thing was

575
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,620
working

576
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:58,079
so the search was on for a cannabinoid

577
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:59,058
receptor and again that was found in

578
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:03,000
2018

579
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:06,778
subsequently known to us now as CB1 the

580
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,339
uh the cannabinoid one receptor

581
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:14,339
um so uh after that there was an all

582
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:17,339
Hands-On deck search for endogenous

583
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:20,158
ligands that's a way of saying that

584
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:23,119
people were looking for molecules within

585
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,520
us endogenous cannabinoids now called

586
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,558
endocannabinoids that would bind with

587
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:33,240
this receptor

588
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:35,819
um but again it was super difficult

589
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,480
um the thing that set Professor mishulam

590
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:42,480
apart was he thought the endogenous

591
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,819
molecules rather than being peptides

592
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:50,099
um you know short amino acid molecules

593
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:53,939
rather would have to be a lipid

594
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:57,899
um to a lodge on this receptor

595
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,400
um so analogous to THC

596
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,798
um and then things get really

597
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,798
interesting because there they were in

598
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:08,158
Israel this is in the lab again with

599
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,859
William Devane and Lumiere hanouche um

600
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,360
his Associates at that time

601
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:18,298
and um they looked for these endogenous

602
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:21,538
cannabinoids in pig brains now again

603
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:23,519
that's anachronistic for sure

604
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:27,058
um I can tell you that Jerusalem where

605
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:29,579
the work was done is a very Kosher City

606
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:33,418
um but there was a place in Tel Aviv

607
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:35,220
that they could get the pig brains they

608
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:39,059
said each time they went back the price

609
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,519
went up but after painstaking work over

610
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:45,058
a couple of years they had a tiny

611
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,759
fraction of this material that they

612
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:48,480
identified chemically

613
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,158
um

614
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,558
as Erica Donal ethanolamide

615
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,100
then they had fun deciding what the

616
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:01,379
common name of the molecule should be

617
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:03,359
as it turned out William Devane was a

618
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,778
Sanskrit scholar

619
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:09,959
um and um he knew that the Sanskrit word

620
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:13,679
for Bliss was Ananda so they called it

621
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,679
anandamide which is a great name a

622
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,419
beautiful coinage

623
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:23,159
and they kept looking they found other

624
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:25,620
related molecules and in 1994 they

625
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:29,520
discovered another called two Erica

626
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:35,699
Donal glycerol less flashy name just 2ag

627
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:38,339
for short that was in 95 yeah uh but uh

628
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,798
then again didn't stop there they found

629
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:44,399
hundreds of related molecules that

630
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,259
seemingly didn't do a lot on their own

631
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,840
um but in putting these together in

632
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:51,599
different combinations by 1998 they

633
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:54,959
figured out that there was Synergy when

634
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:57,599
you had the main players uh with these

635
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,079
less active or inactive uh related

636
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:05,658
molecules uh hence the concept of the

637
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:10,859
Entourage effect was born in 1998.

638
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:13,080
so um so far we have discussed

639
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:16,379
um you know maybe even a dozen at least

640
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,579
10 different uh cannabinoids and you

641
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,278
know functioning aspects of the

642
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:22,019
endocannabinoid system that Dr mishulum

643
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:24,119
is credited for

644
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:26,819
um to round out this group is there is

645
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:28,678
there anything of significance

646
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:30,898
um any other cannabinoids or that that

647
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,519
he discovered that we should make sure

648
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:33,898
we mentioned at this time that we

649
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,319
haven't so far

650
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:40,199
well again just uh to make sure we do

651
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:45,839
justice to its work uh his discoveries

652
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:51,919
included CBD THC CBG CBC

653
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:56,639
um the acid cannabinoids cbna cbda cbga

654
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,320
cannabis cyclol and likely a few more

655
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,720
um that's a great answer I couldn't have

656
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,480
asked for anything better thank you

657
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,880
so so I know kind of like you know as we

658
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,220
as we wrap up the first set here you

659
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,500
know I I know the entirety of the first

660
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,899
set has been how you know we've been

661
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:16,679
talking about how Dr Michelle's research

662
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:20,038
you know um changed our understanding a

663
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:23,038
very specifically of cannabis and the

664
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:25,619
endocannabinoid system on a on a level

665
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:30,058
of perspective kind of like one level of

666
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:35,699
magnitude up like what impact did this

667
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:38,398
entire body of research have on both the

668
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,580
scientific I don't know acceptance and

669
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:45,298
interest in cannabis and in the

670
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:48,898
attraction of more scientists to dive in

671
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:50,099
because Dr michulum's research opened up

672
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:52,798
the area

673
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,480
yeah I in a word it affected it

674
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:58,259
profoundly

675
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,380
um what we see if you track the number

676
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:03,898
of Publications on cannabinoids and the

677
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,340
endocannabinoid system there was a huge

678
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:09,000
growth

679
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:13,019
um in the early 90s which has continued

680
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,298
for for some time you know once these

681
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:17,579
molecules particularly endocannabinoids

682
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:19,798
were identified it then was a matter of

683
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:23,339
experimenting them to see where they are

684
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:26,700
and what they do and the fascinating

685
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:29,879
thing in retrospect is every organ

686
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,100
system every type of physiological

687
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,980
function that was examined there was a

688
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:39,199
role for the endocannabinoid system

689
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:41,460
so again we had uh discovery of

690
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,819
cannabinoid compounds then the

691
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,220
endogenous cannabinoids uh they had to

692
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,859
figure out uh how they were made and

693
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:53,460
broken down the metabolic and catabolic

694
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:56,178
enzymes how they were regulated

695
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:01,519
um so you can see how there was this

696
00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:04,620
expansion sort of a pyramid effect of

697
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,918
research opportunities and they were

698
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:11,000
pursued around the world now

699
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:14,000
unfortunately that is not extended to

700
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,558
Enlightenment on the political side

701
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,480
nor

702
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:21,119
did it totally break down the barriers

703
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,058
to research which still remain in this

704
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:27,178
country admittedly it's easier to study

705
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:29,759
cannabis now than it was then but it

706
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,140
still remains very difficult

707
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,960
yeah

708
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:37,080
um that is certainly the case I I can

709
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,480
imagine after Dr mashulum's

710
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,038
um you know earliest discoveries he

711
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,099
never

712
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,079
um he never wanted for funding though uh

713
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:48,778
during his career because he sounds like

714
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,819
he was an early celebrity and and I just

715
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:53,339
assumed that he was well funded at that

716
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:56,000
point is that is that accurate uh up to

717
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:59,819
a point but only after a certain point

718
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,220
his first uh application of the National

719
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:04,500
Institutes of Health which then is now

720
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,538
has been the main funder of biomedical

721
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,099
research domestically and

722
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:10,500
internationally

723
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,719
but his first application was turned

724
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,298
down with the explanation that nobody

725
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,298
uses cannabis here you know this is

726
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:21,000
Circa 1963.

727
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:23,278
um then the tune changed

728
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,579
um partly it was because of this

729
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:30,058
discovery but additionally there seemed

730
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:33,599
to be a political uh rationale

731
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:36,898
um something the effect that a senator's

732
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,639
son was busted for quote marijuana

733
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:40,798
unquote

734
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,799
um and wanted to know if it was going to

735
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:46,379
make him permanently crazy

736
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:49,319
um all of a sudden NIH was more

737
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:52,220
interested in cannabis and cannabinoids

738
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:56,220
and for the subsequent 40 years

739
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:58,019
Professor michulum had NIH funding

740
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,000
annually

741
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:01,440
it's a good story all right so so we're

742
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,298
going to take a short break and be right

743
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,640
back you are listening to shaping fire

744
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:07,500
and my guest today is Dr Ethan Russo

745
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,358
without these advertisers shaping

746
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,099
firewood not happen so please support

747
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,420
them and let them know you heard them on

748
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:14,940
shaping fire

749
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:17,099
[Music]

750
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,200
the cannabis seed Market is filled with

751
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:21,300
big name and hype breeders fighting to

752
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,739
get your attention and occasionally you

753
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,240
discover a breeder who is breeding

754
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,338
because it is the only thing they care

755
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,898
to do and they would be doing it even if

756
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:30,599
they never made a dime

757
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:32,819
that's my friend Craig hartsaw who makes

758
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,800
seeds as magnetic genetics

759
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,419
Craig comes from five generations of

760
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,460
farmers and is earning his master's

761
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,559
degree in Horticulture right now he's

762
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,240
been growing cannabis for 15 years and

763
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,159
been breeding for nine

764
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,079
he hasn't sold many seeds because he

765
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,579
really isn't a sales guy but I've

766
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,619
personally been growing his seeds for

767
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:52,139
years and I know I can always rely on

768
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:54,720
his seeds to germinate Thrive and smell

769
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,760
and taste great I suggested to Craig

770
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,980
that he should probably sell some seeds

771
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,740
and asked if he had enough stockpile to

772
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:04,440
bother much to my shock he was sitting

773
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:06,179
on five full menus in Cold Storage that

774
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,400
he produced in the last two years and

775
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:11,759
hadn't even tried to sell any of them he

776
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,440
was simply too busy breeding well we his

777
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,420
friends convinced him to make his damn

778
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,440
seeds available to the people and now

779
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,420
they are

780
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,880
for the first time anywhere you can now

781
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,639
buy magnetic genetic seeds at Neptune

782
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,160
seed bank and on strainley.io

783
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,259
Neptune seed bank has just picked up

784
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,598
magnetic genetics for a trial to gauge

785
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,780
your interest they are carrying three

786
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:36,119
strains from his Mean Mug prominence and

787
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,640
turpinato menus which are exclusive to

788
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:41,640
Neptune it's an easy way to score his

789
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:44,159
seeds you can pick up those menus plus

790
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,679
his hillbilly skunk and Candy breath

791
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,539
crosses and more on his profile page on

792
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:51,179
stranely.io

793
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:52,920
if you want very affordable seeds that

794
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:56,299
are exceptional quality with rare

795
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,119
terpene profiles from a good guy go to

796
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:02,039
neptuneseedbank.com or strainley.io

797
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,200
sometimes it is fun to buy the hype

798
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,579
thing from the brand you admire but when

799
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:07,679
you're ready to buy The Strain you'll

800
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:11,420
love from an obscure mad scientist

801
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:13,519
you're ready for magnetic genetics

802
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:17,059
magneticgenetics.org and on Instagram

803
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,059
magnetic genetics

804
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,199
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

805
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:24,119
growing is so valued by Farmers is

806
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,159
because the mycelium networks in the

807
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,680
soil remain established from year to

808
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,420
year and we know these fungal networks

809
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,699
are essential because they are the

810
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,980
nutrient super highways that extend far

811
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:37,559
and wide in the substrate to feed your

812
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,960
plants the trouble with growing in New

813
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,179
Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

814
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,579
is that it takes most of the plant's

815
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:45,980
life just to create these mycelium

816
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:49,019
highways

817
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:51,179
dynomico endometrizal fungi inoculant

818
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:53,759
reduces that time and gets your plant

819
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:55,980
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

820
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,680
and it's three times the concentration

821
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,559
of the other popular brand in the U.S at

822
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:03,598
900 propagules per gram of two fungal

823
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,299
species selected specifically for

824
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,980
cannabis cultivation dynomica is the

825
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,019
result of 30 years of research and

826
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,539
trials at the volcani agriculture

827
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:14,579
Research Institute in Israel it has also

828
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:16,880
been vigorously trialed by cannabis and

829
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:19,619
food Growers across the U.S

830
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,140
dynamico is now available at Grow shops

831
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:24,240
and on Amazon in the United States I

832
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,980

have no customer service

908

shapingfire I am your host shangolos and

909
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,599
my guest today is Dr Ethan Russo

910
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:40,440
so during the first set we talked you

911
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:43,680
know mostly about the the timeline of Dr

912
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,679
michillum's discoveries and clearly how

913
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:49,379
it impacted not only the the research of

914
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:51,659
cannabis itself as a drug but in a

915
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,640
larger form the endocannabinoid system

916
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:55,879
and then the impacts that it had on

917
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:58,618
medical research for humans as a whole

918
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,019
where I want to start out here in second

919
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:03,480
set is that you know how has Dr

920
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:06,420
mushroom's research impacted the

921
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,980
development of of cannabis-based

922
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,720
medicines

923
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,780
um and what potential therapeutic

924
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:14,338
applications have derived from his work

925
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,760
so far

926
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:19,559
um you know contemporarily

927
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,980
yeah that's a great question I mean the

928
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:26,279
first obvious ones are uh you know the

929
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:31,139
classic cannabinoids phytocannabinoids

930
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:34,140
from the plant so at this time uh in

931
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:36,838
terms of cannabis based medicines uh we

932
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:39,118
have synthetic THC as Marinol which has

933
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:43,679
never had big impact but

934
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:46,980
um satavex is an extract of two

935
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:49,879
different chemivers of cannabis one rich

936
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,679
in THC and one rich in CBD

937
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,599
and that's approved in 30 countries

938
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,419
around the world for treatment of

939
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:00,320
spasticity and multiple sclerosis but

940
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:05,099
not in the U.S in the U.S

941
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:09,059
for the last few years we have had uh 98

942
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:12,359
pure cannabidiol as epidiolics for

943
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:14,400
treatment of severe epilepsy syndromes

944
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:17,699
but again

945
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:21,599
um we're looking at Future developments

946
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:25,319
related to cannabigirol canaba chromine

947
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:28,880
and many others and uh I need to extend

948
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:32,220
the conversation to talk about the

949
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,039
semi-synthetic analogs that Professor

950
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:36,539
Michelin made and

951
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:37,980
perhaps we could run through those yeah

952
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:39,659
please do because I'm not sure what

953
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:44,039
those are

954
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:46,259
okay well uh you know chemists like to

955
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:49,559
take a molecule and see how it might be

956
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,700
quote improved unquote meaning different

957
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:56,400
meaning patentable or longer lasting or

958
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:59,879
more potent so a good example there

959
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,760
would be what's called hu-210 so the hu

960
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,000
medicines were all discovered by

961
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:09,000
Professor Michelin at Hebrew University

962
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,219
so that's where the hu uh derives so

963
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,019
hu-210

964
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:17,399
um was um

965
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:19,380
a dimethyl heptal derivative of THC so

966
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,358
instead of just a five carbon side chain

967
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,460
it was a seven carbon side chain with

968
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:28,739
two methyl groups on it and that made it

969
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:31,559
more potent and longer lasting so hu 210

970
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:34,379
um is something I believe on the order

971
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:37,318
of 50 to 100 times more potent than THC

972
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,818
and it's been a very important agent in

973
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:42,179
laboratory studies of the

974
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:44,239
endocannabinoid system but not a drug

975
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:46,919
for clinical use

976
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:49,019
it has appeared occasionally in

977
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,599
synthetic cannabinoids but it's not

978
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:54,900
something I would ever recommend anybody

979
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,818
taking I have a colleague who did and

980
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,200
spent the whole weekend

981
00:43:56,818 --> 00:44:05,119
um with a very big experience

982
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:09,379
let's leave it at that I'll never tell

983
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:12,300
a closely related molecule with hu211

984
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:15,240
now this one actually got into the

985
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:18,300
clinics but wasn't approved and it's a

986
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:20,699
bit of a sad story this had the name

987
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,480
dexa nabinol

988
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:25,618
um

989
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:29,519
this was investigated by a now defunct

990
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:31,858
company called farmos an Israeli company

991
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,800
they developed this for treatment of

992
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:36,779
severe head injuries the idea being that

993
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,480
they would give this intravenously after

994
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,640
someone had a severe head injury and

995
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,780
hopefully it would help prevent damage

996
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:48,719
from the the head trauma

997
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,280
um however after this was licensed to

998
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,259
the company

999
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,359
um they never consulted Professor

1000
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,700
Michelin again

1001
00:44:54,358 --> 00:45:00,598
um I think that they made a big mistake

1002
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:01,980
in that because they again only use this

1003
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,960
once

1004
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,079
um after the onset of the head injury

1005
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,240
and and not subsequently it worked in

1006
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:13,800
phase two clinical trials but in phase

1007
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:14,399
three nothing uh just didn't work

1008
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,280
um

1009
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,338
I wonder in retrospect whether they had

1010
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,920
given uh administered it multiple times

1011
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:25,500
the result could have been different

1012
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,900
but that's probably a done deal at this

1013
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,358
point and then there were a variety of

1014
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,460
agency developed that yet could make it

1015
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:35,400
to the clinics

1016
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:39,659
um Professor Michelin was very active in

1017
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,880
research on CB2 the non-psychoactive

1018
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:43,219
receptor that's important in pain and

1019
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,740
inflammation

1020
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:48,539
he thought that one of the things the

1021
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:52,219
endocannabinoid system

1022
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:55,858
did was provide

1023
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:57,199
protection from non-infectious insults

1024
00:45:55,858 --> 00:46:00,659
are

1025
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:03,838
non-immunologic insults it developed a

1026
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:07,199
medicine called hu308 which is very

1027
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:10,078
active at the CB2 receptor but not

1028
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,879
activated CB1 also wouldn't be

1029
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,440
intoxicating and that's been

1030
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:20,300
investigated for arthritic conditions

1031
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:23,539
um and then more recently in 2018

1032
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:25,339
he came out with uh

1033
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:28,279
hu580

1034
00:46:25,338 --> 00:46:31,019
so what this is is they took the

1035
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:36,480
cannabidiolic acid molecule which is

1036
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:37,519
unstable cbda and they made it a methyl

1037
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,619
Ester

1038
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:45,059
what that means is they put this group

1039
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:47,700
on it that made it shelf stable and it

1040
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:49,818
could be a pro drug in other words when

1041
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:55,439
taken into the body it would break down

1042
00:46:49,818 --> 00:46:56,880
spontaneously into cbda which in testing

1043
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,000
has shown

1044
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,460
um very powerful

1045
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,480
activity on the serotonin 1A receptor

1046
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:08,280
where CBD also works but it's somewhere

1047
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,059
between a hundred and a thousand times

1048
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:15,619
more potent so this may have application

1049
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:18,779
and treating nausea of different causes

1050
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:21,380
among other things I also might have a

1051
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,240
role in treating anxiety

1052
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,880
but that really hasn't gotten into the

1053
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:30,299
clinic yet there's still

1054
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:34,500
um could be could be developments there

1055
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:37,099
so I have a um a two-part question it is

1056
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:40,380
a it's a request for a vocabulary

1057
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:42,900
clarification but then also I would like

1058
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:45,420
you to explain its use in the lab and

1059
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,460
here's here is what it is

1060
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:50,880
um you began the answer talking about

1061
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:53,338
the Cannabis analogs that Dr mishulum

1062
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,559
had created and so when you said that

1063
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:58,380
I'm like all right that sounds like

1064
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:00,420
synthetic cannabinoids uh to me and

1065
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,579
we've discussed uh both you and I and

1066
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,680
then and then on other episodes about

1067
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:06,300
how synthetic cannabinoids can be useful

1068
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,578
in the lab but

1069
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,380
um it's not as great when they get out

1070
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:12,000
of the lab and people try to take them

1071
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,980
as if they're from nature and they're

1072
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,380
not but so you started by describing

1073
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,480
these these analogs that Dr Michelin was

1074
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,059
making and then you described these

1075
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,280
agents that Dr michulum was making and

1076
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:26,279
then you seem to contrast and say and

1077
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,960
also synthetic cannabinoids where if he

1078
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,940
made them it sounds like they're all

1079
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,619
synthetic cannabinoids so so the first

1080
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,900
part of the answer I'd like you to tease

1081
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:36,420
those apart but then second for people

1082
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:40,318
who have never thought about the use of

1083
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:42,539
synthetic cannabinoids in in research in

1084
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,400
the lab only but not actually used out

1085
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:48,239
in the real world would you explain what

1086
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:52,019
that that lab tool is for sure

1087
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:55,439
uh so again of the ones I mentioned hu

1088
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:58,639
210 was the only one that was a CB1

1089
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:03,059
Agonist so you know would cause

1090
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:05,639
intoxication so hu 210 and related drugs

1091
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:07,259
in the lab would be used to look at

1092
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,500
binding

1093
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,079
um so say you had an unknown substance

1094
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:16,579
you wanted to compare its activity to

1095
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:20,640
something it could be compared to hu 210

1096
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:25,079
as as one example whether your new

1097
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:28,858
substance could displace hu 210 from the

1098
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:31,318
receptor compete with it so it'd be a

1099
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:34,318
measure of potency

1100
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:38,519
um and you know you're correct I have

1101
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:42,440
decried the use of high potency CB1

1102
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:47,219
Agonist says potentially quite dangerous

1103
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:50,400
but these other agents hu211 308 580

1104
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:52,679
were all for entirely different purposes

1105
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,838
and really would have no activity on the

1106
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:59,039
CB1 receptor

1107
00:49:54,838 --> 00:50:01,799
I see so so it sounds like analog agent

1108
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,559
and synthetic cannabinoids are probably

1109
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,619
in the same bucket but we delineate

1110
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:10,559
between them because some of them are

1111
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:13,800
for you solely in the lab and and and

1112
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,599
should not be used outside by for people

1113
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,780
for either medicinal or recreational

1114
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:22,019
reasons but then the other ones are also

1115
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:24,780
synthetic but they're also promising as

1116
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:26,400
as actual healthy medicines and so we we

1117
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,400
just refer to them differently then

1118
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,420
quite right okay great right cool thank

1119
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,818
you

1120
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,579
um so

1121
00:50:31,818 --> 00:50:38,099
uh well while Dr michulum's role was

1122
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:40,859
clearly set in Pharmaceuticals right you

1123
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:43,559
and I have spoken on this program often

1124
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:45,000
about our our both of ours belief in

1125
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:48,420
whole plant medicine whole plant

1126
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,639
cannabis resin what were Dr mishulum's

1127
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,460
personal thoughts about whole plant

1128
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:56,039
medicine and using the whole resin

1129
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,019
instead of isolating compounds and then

1130
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:00,659
mix and matching them to make something

1131
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:03,659
patentable since he worked in the

1132
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:05,838
pharmaceutical realm but also his heart

1133
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:10,019
was in pure medicine

1134
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:12,139
uh and you know he straddled Both Worlds

1135
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:12,139
um

1136
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:19,379
part of uh the time that we work most

1137
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:24,179
closely together was between

1138
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:28,680
um 2003 and 2014 we were both uh working

1139
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:30,960
actively uh with GW Pharmaceuticals

1140
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:35,460
um they would have an annual research

1141
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:39,659
meeting uh which uh he attended I

1142
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:42,059
attended uh as an uh scientific senior

1143
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:43,558
medical advisor at that time to the

1144
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:46,500
company

1145
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:49,579
um you know so we worked with people at

1146
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:52,579
the company and also with other

1147
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:56,339
cannabinoid scientists mainly European

1148
00:51:52,579 --> 00:52:00,359
and get together and talk about projects

1149
00:51:56,338 --> 00:52:03,599
and plans and a lot of what we know now

1150
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:05,880
about cannabidiol cannabigirol and the

1151
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:09,838
others came from that research

1152
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:12,599
so he absolutely understood and aided

1153
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:15,000
the development of these whole plant

1154
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:17,280
medicines uh side effects and

1155
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,039
epidialytics

1156
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,220
um at the same time he was working on

1157
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:25,259
the semi-synthetic analogues

1158
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:28,739
um I would highlight a point of

1159
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:32,040
difference perhaps uh he and I

1160
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:33,500
um I'm not so sure he was absolutely

1161
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:37,199
convinced

1162
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:40,380
of the role of the terpenoids uh in

1163
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:43,919
cannabis uh you may recall I pointed out

1164
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:46,318
in 1998 he had coined the term with

1165
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,500
Professor Ben Shabbat uh of the

1166
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:52,440
Entourage effect initially applied to

1167
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:56,099
endogenous cannabinoids the next year

1168
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,838
the same pair published another article

1169
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:01,880
and pointed out that the same thing

1170
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:04,500
could apply to cannabis the idea that

1171
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:08,039
plants might be better medicines than

1172
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:11,280
their single components well I I already

1173
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:13,318
felt that way and I really seized upon

1174
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,599
this and although some people have

1175
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:19,460
misattributed coining the term the

1176
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:22,800
Entourage effect me I didn't I may have

1177
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:25,980
popularized it through my efforts to

1178
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,400
show the Synergy between terpenoids and

1179
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:33,300
cannabinoids I think he needed a little

1180
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:36,180
more convincing at the time in 1999 they

1181
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:38,700
pointed out that this idea that plants

1182
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:43,379
could be better medicine than single

1183
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:46,618
compounds was a theory but in the

1184
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:48,318
ensuing 24 years we've had a lot of

1185
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:52,500
proof for that theory

1186
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:55,619
so you know a good scientist

1187
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:58,858
um is thinking about possibilities and

1188
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:01,019
also retaining an air of skepticism I

1189
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:02,940
think that's necessary sometimes you

1190
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:05,280
have to play Devil's Advocate with your

1191
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,139
colleagues or with yourself

1192
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,819
well yeah because the whole point is

1193
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:11,338
that we're hypothesizing we don't want

1194
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:12,719
to go into it assuming we're right so we

1195
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:15,900
have to we have to be our own doubles

1196
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:18,358
Advocate sure yeah so much has changed

1197
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,940
in cannabis research in the last decade

1198
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:23,338
of Dr michulum's life like what was Dr

1199
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:26,280
mashulum's opinion on the current state

1200
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:28,318
of cannabis research and the potential

1201
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:32,040
for new discoveries in the field

1202
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:35,579
well I he never stopped working

1203
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:39,058
um you know he continued throughout his

1204
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:41,039
career to find new things to do uh We've

1205
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:44,280
mentioned many of his accomplishments

1206
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:47,420
but uh in more recent decades

1207
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,980
um he worked uh with the late etai Bob

1208
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,300
on

1209
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:56,159
endocannabinoids and their role in

1210
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:58,800
treating osteoporosis he did some

1211
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:01,980
clinical work on cannabidiol for graph

1212
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,380
versus host disease that affects

1213
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,440
transplant patients

1214
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:11,579
um and it it really never ended again

1215
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:14,159
the more recent work on making the

1216
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:16,700
methyl Esters of the acid cannabinoids

1217
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:20,699
to make them more stable

1218
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:24,598
and also the important work on the CB2

1219
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:26,879
receptor done with Paul Parker who's at

1220
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:29,760
the National Institutes of Health and

1221
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,000
the idea that the endocannabinoid system

1222
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:37,500
provided protection from non-infectious

1223
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:40,139
insults so it never ended

1224
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:43,679
um so the the wording of this question

1225
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:45,900
is is kind of um I guess juvenile but uh

1226
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,058
I think the point of it is good uh you

1227
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,800
know as as

1228
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:53,339
cannabinoid research expanded here in

1229
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,460
the last you know 15 years or so did did

1230
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:58,799
Dr michulum

1231
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:01,740
was he at all annoyed that there were

1232
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:04,019
people who were not approaching cannabis

1233
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:05,879
medicine properly in some way because

1234
00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:07,318
there were so many people to it or was

1235
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,579
he generally thinking that this was

1236
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:09,900
badass that there were all these

1237
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:11,039
different types of scientists looking

1238
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,599
into it

1239
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:16,079
ah

1240
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:20,818
you know he was not prone to criticize

1241
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:23,818
that often however he was quite uh

1242
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:25,259
willing to decry the dearth of clinical

1243
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:29,099
work

1244
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:31,680
um that had gone on in in any number of

1245
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:34,619
areas uh you know this is certainly

1246
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:36,598
manifest by the fact that again here's a

1247
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:39,480
bench scientist

1248
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:42,000
um with uh uh a lifetime record of

1249
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,440
accomplishment and when the

1250
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,599
International Association for

1251
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:49,139
cannabinoid medicines a clinical group

1252
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,880
was begun in 2001 he was right there at

1253
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:54,299
every meeting

1254
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,460
um and um contributing

1255
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:00,119
um and encouraging people to do more

1256
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:03,960
work so that was another place that uh

1257
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:04,858
we we got together uh all told I tallied

1258
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,838
it up

1259
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:12,358
um after word of his demise and he and I

1260
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,699
were together at meetings or working

1261
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:17,239
together and at least 14 different

1262
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:17,239
countries

1263
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,659
that actually must have been a pretty

1264
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,079
heartfelt list that you worked on after

1265
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:27,420
his passing last week you bet yeah

1266
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:29,640
um to wrap up this set I was curious you

1267
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,760
know we you told that great story about

1268
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:35,519
about you know the cake but how did Dr

1269
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:38,940
michulum view the use of cannabis for

1270
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:42,239
recreational purposes like in society

1271
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:45,300
um and and has his research affected his

1272
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:47,098
stance over the years

1273
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:49,440
um yeah a little bit of a tough one it's

1274
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:51,660
not something he talked about a lot you

1275
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,358
know my impression would be that he

1276
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:56,039
thought that a lot of it was a

1277
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:58,619
distraction

1278
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:00,358
um and he was laser focused on clinical

1279
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:03,358
applications

1280
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:07,440
um for this system

1281
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:10,500
um so he he wasn't a prohibitionist

1282
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,539
um overtly in any kind of sense

1283
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,539
um but I think

1284
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:18,838
you know far more interesting to him was

1285
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:21,058
how can we harness these substances uh

1286
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:23,818
to treat disease

1287
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:25,740
yeah I can see him being all listen I'm

1288
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:28,500
trying to get the labs going I'm trying

1289
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:30,779
to get funding and you guys getting

1290
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,239
busted for illegal weed is in the news

1291
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,119
that it's not helpful and so not not

1292
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:38,879
that he's necessary so yeah right he was

1293
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,160
he was never so overt about it but I I'm

1294
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,920
sure he may have harbored internal

1295
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:45,719
feelings of a similar nature yeah I can

1296
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,039
follow that all right thank you so we're

1297
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:48,598
going to take another short break and be

1298
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:50,579
right back you're listening to shaping

1299
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,420
fire and my guest today is Dr Ethan

[Music]

1302
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,780
there are a lot of good people launching

1303
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,639
new businesses in cannabis psilocybin

1304
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,980
and other psychedelics and it's very

1305
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:04,139
strange Time For Us in the same moment

1306
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,000
that psilocybin mushrooms are illegal at

1307
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:07,980
the federal level they are becoming

1308
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,559
increasingly legal in States across the

1309
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,119
country these businesses leading the way

into the future of plant medicines

1311
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:17,338
require specialized legal representation

1312
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,859
by attorneys who have depth not only in

1313
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:21,599
litigation mergers and Acquisitions but

1314
00:59:19,858 --> 00:59:22,920
also in psychedelic and other plant

1316
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,298
green light Law Group has been

shapingfire I am your host shangolos and

1455
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:35,519
my guest today is Dr Ethan Russo

1456
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,798
so Ethan how has Dr michulum's work

1457
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:40,259
impacted the development of new drug

1458
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:42,239
therapies Beyond cannabis I can imagine

1459
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:46,040
that there are other areas of medicine

1460
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,039
that are benefiting from his research

1461
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:49,640
uh again

1462
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:51,798
um

1463
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:54,719
the

1464
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:57,480
endocannabinoid system is ubiquitous it

1465
01:04:54,719 --> 01:05:00,058
is the major homeostatic regulator of

1466
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,679
human physiology and that of all higher

1467
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:03,540
animals

1468
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:06,058
um so it's had a huge impact

1469
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:10,019
unfortunately that has an extended

1470
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:12,720
towards education of medical students on

1471
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:16,440
the system and its importance

1472
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:19,618
um so again you know this idea that

1473
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:22,980
there were these lipid molecules rather

1474
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:27,420
than water solid soluble molecules the

1475
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:29,400
cannabinoids led to a real expansion

1476
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:33,240
um you know the endocannabinoid system

1477
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:36,240
isn't really confined to the two known

1478
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:39,000
cannabinoid receptors it's become a much

1479
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:43,159
broader concept and includes a number of

1480
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,239
the trip receptors and even some of the

1481
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:50,279
serotonin receptors particularly

1482
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:53,939
serotonin 1A which I'm happy to say was

1483
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,680
an extension of work that I did with

1484
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,679
colleagues at the University of Montana

1485
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:02,098
back in 2005.

1486
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:05,399
um so it it's been an ever expanding

1487
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:07,740
it's like the tendrils of the plant have

1488
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:11,420
extended and all these areas of science

1489
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:14,519
it's been an amazing thing to see

1490
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:17,039
over the 30 years since the discovery of

1491
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:18,599
the endocannabinoid system

1492
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,119
you know that's one of the reasons why

1493
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:23,338
some people are even skeptical or

1494
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,440
suspicious of cannabis because they say

1495
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:27,298
oh you people talk about it like it's a

1496
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,818
Panacea it's like like as if it's going

1497
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:31,380
to solve all these things and and that

1498
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:33,000
only comes from people who don't

1499
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:35,338
understand the endocannabinoid system

1500
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,798
because that is the whole point it's

1501
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:40,259
everywhere and so by working with

1502
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:42,239
cannabinoids you can work on all these

1503
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,559
different ailments and

1504
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:45,479
um I don't I don't think that the

1505
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:47,339
skepticism for that is going to be

1506
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,260
overcome until more people are familiar

1507
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:51,779
with how the endocannabinoid system

1508
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:54,720
actually functions

1509
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:57,298
quite right you know again it it's

1510
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:59,459
important to say there really aren't a

1511
01:06:57,298 --> 01:07:01,920
lot of things that cannabis cures

1512
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:04,519
however there are tremendous number of

1513
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:09,480
things that cannabis treats effectively

1514
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:11,239
at least as an adjunct if not directly

1515
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:14,338
so what was

1516
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:17,459
what did Dr Michelin feel was like the

1517
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:21,480
most rewarding aspect of his uh career I

1518
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:24,960
mean uh his his list of of recognitions

1519
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,480
and awards are it's a long list but but

1520
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,519
the list of what he achieved is

1521
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,960
different than the achievements that he

1522
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:35,940
himself was most proud of

1523
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,500
well you know that's a hard one for me

1524
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:41,039
to say

1525
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:44,519
um he was not the kind of guy that uh

1526
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:47,339
rested on his proverbial Laurels

1527
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:51,179
um there was always more work to do so I

1528
01:07:47,338 --> 01:07:54,538
don't think it's something you dwell on

1529
01:07:51,179 --> 01:07:56,818
um you know when we look at this list of

1530
01:07:54,539 --> 01:08:00,059
accomplishments over the course of six

1531
01:07:56,818 --> 01:08:04,259
decades it's astounding but the obvious

1532
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:07,260
pattern is the guy never quit working uh

1533
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:10,980
or thinking about what's next

1534
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:12,720
um so I to me it was a role model in

1535
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:15,838
that regard

1536
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:18,599
um you know it's to an extent if I can

1537
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:21,119
compare myself it's the same thing when

1538
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:24,420
I get a paper accepted for publication

1539
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:27,179
I'm happy for a little while but

1540
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,759
um thinking about what's next

1541
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:31,980
um

1542
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:35,819
the Restless mind syndrome while Dr

1543
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:38,278
mishula was involved in cannabis policy

1544
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:40,140
Creation in Israel much more than ever

1545
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:41,880
in the United States

1546
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,739
um what advice do you think Dr Michele

1547
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,960
would give to U.S policy makers and

1548
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:48,899
Regulators regarding the regulation of

1549
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:51,779
cannabis and cannabis based medicines

1550
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:54,960
I think it'd be really concise and that

1551
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:59,600
would be to follow the science

1552
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:03,539
um again I have no doubt that he had uh

1553
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:06,179
pervasive uh skepticism about the

1554
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:09,119
ability of politicians to incorporate

1555
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:11,819
the kind of scientific knowledge that

1556
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:15,659
was going on in this area

1557
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:18,779
um but I I don't remember him wasting a

1558
01:09:15,659 --> 01:09:20,939
lot of time with criticism of that uh

1559
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,520
there might be some remark in passing

1560
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:25,019
but again

1561
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:28,279
his concentration was always on

1562
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:28,279
advancement of the science

1563
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:35,580
um so so looking forward I mean clearly

1564
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:37,678
Dr mishulum mentored so many and and he

1565
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:39,778
even mentored so many people who never

1566
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:43,259
met him right who who knew him through

1567
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:45,179
his research and his interviews what

1568
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:46,798
advice do you think that Dr Michelin

1569
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:49,079
would give to Young researchers

1570
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:51,000
interested in studying cannabis and its

1571
01:09:49,079 --> 01:09:52,920
compounds now

1572
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,738
well I think the first thing he'd say

1573
01:09:52,920 --> 01:10:00,060
was expect to work hard

1574
01:09:55,738 --> 01:10:02,339
um it is a very deep and uh difficult

1575
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:06,980
field I mean the thing that attracted me

1576
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:11,400
when I really got into it Circa 1996 was

1577
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:13,019
uh boy this is complex but it's all so

1578
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:17,339
exciting

1579
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:20,300
um and uh boy I became addicted to

1580
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:23,279
cannabinoid knowledge very quickly and

1581
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:25,380
led to a career change and that's

1582
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:27,539
happened to plenty of other scientists

1583
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:29,219
and Physicians

1584
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:31,800
um but

1585
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:36,480
um you know I have to really identify

1586
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:40,860
his personal role uh in this because

1587
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:43,139
um the thing that most people met or uh

1588
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:47,339
corresponded with Dr Michelle and will

1589
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:50,219
tell you was how availing he was of

1590
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:53,579
um his time in helping them with

1591
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:56,399
whatever question they posed to him

1592
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:58,859
um so I've met hundreds of people not

1593
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:01,198
just scientists who said you know I

1594
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:04,619
wrote to him and I was shocked he got

1595
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:07,079
back to me and you know or even we

1596
01:11:04,619 --> 01:11:09,119
talked on the phone or zoom and he gave

1597
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:12,359
me all this time and people are just

1598
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:13,920
blown away by that but that's the way he

1599
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:15,658
was

1600
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,940
um and she explained he didn't didn't

1601
01:11:15,658 --> 01:11:21,679
have a lot of hobbies but he was always

1602
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:21,678
willing to talk about this

1603
01:11:21,899 --> 01:11:29,399
um so it's it's kind of an amazing set

1604
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:32,158
of circumstances that Dr mishulum

1605
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:34,859
you know even got to be a researcher his

1606
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:37,500
his family was persecuted by the Nazis

1607
01:11:34,859 --> 01:11:40,500
his father was placed in a concentration

1608
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:42,479
camp and survived and eventually Dr

1609
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,800
mushroom found his way to Israel where

1610
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:46,439
you know we all know his research

1611
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,840
blossomed of course as a Jewish person

1612
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:51,779
this would have been part of his culture

1613
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:54,060
and his awareness of his entire life in

1614
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:56,579
what ways do you think it influenced his

1615
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:59,400
life choices or even research choices

1616
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:02,219
that that his his he he grew up in

1617
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:04,139
persecuted times

1618
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:06,719
um yeah you know because we had so much

1619
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:09,119
one-on-one time uh these were things I

1620
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:12,000
got to talk to him about you know is his

1621
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:13,859
early experiences and what they went

1622
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,020
through in the war

1623
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:18,059
um you know basically

1624
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:21,480
um Bulgaria

1625
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:24,000
um was occupied by the Nazis early on

1626
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:27,779
um there was a certain uh well definite

1627
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,960
level of of collaboration a very strange

1628
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:34,259
situation uh developed um in that King

1629
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:37,198
Boris in Bulgaria uh decided that they

1630
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:41,100
would protect the Jews of Bulgaria to an

1631
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:45,839
extent but they had invaded Macedonia

1632
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:49,500
next door and basically allowed uh even

1633
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:53,340
collaborated with the Nazis in

1634
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:56,219
um in sending the Jews of Macedonia to

1635
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:57,440
the death camps treblanca uh in most

1636
01:12:56,219 --> 01:13:00,779
instances

1637
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:03,238
there went uh all of my family on my

1638
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:05,039
father's side with the exception of my

1639
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:06,899
grandfather

1640
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:07,560
um so

1641
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:09,899
um

1642
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,179
you know it was a difficult situation as

1643
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:14,460
you mentioned it is his father spent

1644
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:17,520
time in a concentration camp but when it

1645
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:20,760
burned down and he helped the people

1646
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:22,679
that were victims of that they decided

1647
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:26,880
to let him go

1648
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:29,819
um but uh after the war Bulgaria became

1649
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:33,179
a communist country that was again

1650
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:36,779
increase in anti-Semitism and um that's

1651
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:38,940
when he emigrated to Israel in 1949.

1652
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,658
came out of this

1653
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:42,359
um

1654
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:45,539
again it's not something he dwelled upon

1655
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:47,579
however I think that

1656
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:50,760
um it probably caused him to take

1657
01:13:47,579 --> 01:13:54,359
nothing for granted uh in life he was an

1658
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:57,600
extremely open-minded person

1659
01:13:54,359 --> 01:14:01,079
um he also wasn't tainted by politics

1660
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:05,120
which is is so easy to have happen

1661
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:09,000
um you know I can give a lot of examples

1662
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:11,698
uh in in 1999 when I met Professor

1663
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,760
Michelin I also met uh Professor

1664
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:15,960
mahmudel Saleh from the University of

1665
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:19,860
Mississippi

1666
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:21,420
uh who was an Egyptian and I wondered

1667
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:22,859
geez how are these guys going to get

1668
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:26,640
along but in fact they've been

1669
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:30,299
colleagues forever and um you know uh

1670
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:33,780
the politics of their uh

1671
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:36,840
their Nations never entered into their

1672
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:40,819
relationship also when I went to do

1673
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:45,539
research on cannabis in Morocco in 2002

1674
01:14:40,819 --> 01:14:48,179
I was delighted with how curious people

1675
01:14:45,539 --> 01:14:50,698
were about professor micheliner and the

1676
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:53,880
reverence that they had for him so it

1677
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:57,238
really transcended politics uh finally

1678
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:59,880
uh Professor micholum had Palestinian

1679
01:14:57,238 --> 01:15:03,000
researchers in his lab

1680
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:06,359
um you know and again there uh the

1681
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,300
business was science it wasn't politics

1682
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:11,399
it reminds me of of how you referred to

1683
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:15,300
his his thought that he wasn't as

1684
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:17,639
interested in the in the you know he he

1685
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:20,579
thought that science should inform

1686
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:23,340
regulations and policy I can imagine him

1687
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:25,800
having that same idea about politics and

1688
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:28,739
and race and how he interacted with

1689
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:33,300
others where where it's like the science

1690
01:15:28,738 --> 01:15:35,459
was was the priority and and and it's

1691
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:37,380
better for us to all be I'll be friends

1692
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:41,039
and focus on the science than letting

1693
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:45,000
the that the rest of the world into our

1694
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:48,060
lab to to slow us down you bet yeah

1695
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,100
so I'd like to finish this episode

1696
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:52,500
um with um you know a bit of a personal

1697
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,659
question for you I really appreciate

1698
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:56,340
um the time that you've offered us

1699
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:58,319
um and and sharing your your personal

1700
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:59,880
stories of Dr michulum you know

1701
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:03,179
obviously the two of you were such good

1702
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:06,239
friends as to feel like family and uh

1703
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:10,020
I'm curious what was Dr Michele's impact

1704
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:12,119
on you as both a cannabis researcher but

1705
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:15,000
also as a human being

1706
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:17,880
uh well he was a role model in every

1707
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,719
respect he was a very magnanimous and

1708
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,859
magnetic guy uh very warm

1709
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:24,899
um funny

1710
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:29,399
uh you know I mentioned we had this

1711
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:31,500
immediate Bond as fellow Sephardic Jew

1712
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:34,979
um I considered him like my surrogate

1713
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:38,399
Uncle he was 22 years older than me uh

1714
01:16:34,979 --> 01:16:40,259
he looked a little bit like my father

1715
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:43,379
um you know for all I know we could have

1716
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:46,020
been genetic cousins on some level

1717
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:48,719
um because it was interchange during the

1718
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:50,640
Ottoman era between it was a Bulgarian

1719
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:54,119
Macedonia were all part of the Ottoman

1720
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:56,880
Empire at that time but

1721
01:16:54,119 --> 01:17:01,380
um you know it was a great relationship

1722
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:03,659
and uh I miss him I was really proud

1723
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:07,140
um that he asked me to write the first

1724
01:17:03,658 --> 01:17:09,839
chapter of his last book in 2005

1725
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:12,119
um he thought that they needed an

1726
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,100
article on the history of cannabis and

1727
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:16,140
that

1728
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:19,140
should begin with one of the oldest

1729
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:22,260
cannabis cultures in India and as it

1730
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:25,560
happened I had this huge amount of data

1731
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:27,960
it amassed with nowhere to go and here

1732
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,840
he asked me to write a book chapter and

1733
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:34,020
so I I was very pleased with that

1734
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,819
also uh he provided me with what I think

1735
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:37,679
is one of the best compliments I've ever

1736
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:41,219
had in my life

1737
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:44,880
um it was probably about 2008 we were at

1738
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:46,319
a conference in London together and he

1739
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,679
tried to introduce me to somebody

1740
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:52,198
already knew uh your garage the

1741
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:55,800
Swiss scientists and he said something

1742
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:58,859
the effect that of I'd like you to meet

1743
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:03,539
my friend Ethan Russo and then he said

1744
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:06,539
he has many crazy ideas and I I left

1745
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:08,579
like hell because if he knew Rafi that

1746
01:18:06,539 --> 01:18:10,859
was a great compliment and I certainly

1747
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:13,979
took it as such

1748
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:17,399
um yeah that's that's a beautiful story

1749
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:19,439
and I can imagine that you know right

1750
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:21,119
now in this this you know week or two

after his passing

1752
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:27,658

um you know history changes and and

1761
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:51,658
people forget and it's very important to

1762
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,879
um to record these people who mean so

1763
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:56,399

email address which is Ethan Russo at

1790
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:04,859
comcast.net and you know I just want to

1791
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:06,238
say that Ethan you know I think yes it

1792
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:07,619
gets back to everybody or at least tries

1793
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:09,899
to get back to everybody but also

1794
01:20:07,619 --> 01:20:13,439
realize that he is inactive everyday

1795
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:15,179
researcher still and so sometimes it

1796
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:17,158
takes him a while to get back with folks

1797
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:19,440
and um you know you might you might not

1798
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:21,179
get the reply you want until he's you

1799
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:22,678
know stuck in an airport somewhere for a

1800
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:25,380
couple hours

1801
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:28,440
um and then uh there's a great series on

1802
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:31,319
the shaping fire YouTube channel uh the

1803
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:34,979
Ethan Russo shaping fire sessions which

1804
01:20:31,319 --> 01:20:37,319
is a series of uh 10 short videos on an

1805
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:40,559
array of topics that I thought were

1806
01:20:37,319 --> 01:20:42,840
being under under considered in cannabis

1807
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,820
and so Ethan and I sat down in his front

1808
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,100
room and he addressed those various

1809
01:20:44,819 --> 01:20:49,158
topics and then finally

1810
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:51,960
um you know I don't think anybody has

1811
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:54,839
appeared on shaping fire as much as
