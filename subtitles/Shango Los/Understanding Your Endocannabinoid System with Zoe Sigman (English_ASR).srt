1
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,789
yeah okay I'll make it much briefer this

2
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,320
time hi I'm Zoe thank you guys so much

3
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:31,539
for coming if you have questions please

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,460
save them for the end I tried to make

5
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,200
this really easy to understand there

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,090
might be questions that's okay

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,109
I talked really fast if I talk to you

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,110
last let me know

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,870
okay little history context the

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,579
endocannabinoids system it has a very

11
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,729
long history and we're going to shove it

12
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,449
into three South slice um first things

13
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:00,419
first

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,219
evolutionary history so the

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,439
endocannabinoid system is present in all

16
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,129
vertebrates and it's present in more

17
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,569
than just vertebrates in fact components

18
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,609
of the endocannabinoids system has been

19
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,829
found in everything from humans to fungi

20
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,868
but the endocannabinoids system as we

21
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,478
understand it now it exists in all

22
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,879
coordinates which is a specialized genus

23
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,439
of animals that includes vertebrates and

24
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,319
also things like the sea squirt which is

25
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,629
not a vertebrate it is very squishy but

26
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,969
that has none of cannabinoid system so

27
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,069
chordates evolved around five hundred

28
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,189
and thirty million years ago vertebrates

29
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:38,069
evolved around 525 million years ago our

30
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,868
researchers are hesitant to put a an

31
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,179
exact pinpoint on when the

32
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:43,769
endocannabinoids system evolved which is

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,820
fair we don't actually have any way to

34
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:50,929
tell but that's a little like taste of

35
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,339
how old this system is as I was reading

36
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:55,679
one of my favorite researchers dr. John

37
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,670
McFarlane he had this lovely quote about

38
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,640
the evolution of the endocannabinoids

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,500
system that I just wanted to read to you

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,118
so over evolutionary time we see

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,679
duplications and mutations of the

42
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,539
endocannabinoids sit receptors and

43
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:07,890
ligands the symbol for Enda can end up

44
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,868
cannabinoid evolution is not a

45
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,939
bifurcating tree but an inter waving

46
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:16,139
arabesque of Ko evolving receptors and

47
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:18,060
ligands so rate isn't that words I will

48
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,309
get into what all those things mean but

49
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,840
that just means like this system evolved

50
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,310
in many different species at many

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,400
different times in many different ways

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,598
for many different reasons and then we

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,640
ended up with it it's complicated all

54
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:35,810
right so moving on to slightly more

55
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,669
modern times the timeline

56
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,069
this is important in understanding of

57
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:42,979
why we understand what we do in doge

58
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:45,379
about the endocannabinoid system so 1964

59
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:48,500
rafael Chilam elucidated the structure

60
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:52,509
of THC just so you know 1963 the

61
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:57,050
structure CBD was elucidated and then

62
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:59,659
nothing for a long time scientists

63
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,260
thought that the vitamin a monoid like

64
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:04,879
THC worked through a nonspecific

65
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:07,370
membrane-associated action which is

66
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,840
about as specific as it sounds

67
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,340
so they didn't really know it had

68
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,719
something to do with lipids it did some

69
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,620
cool stuff and there wasn't really

70
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:19,729
funding and so they moved on um and then

71
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,680
80s NIDA was like marijuana is bad let's

72
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:24,139
prove that it's bad by funding it

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:31,879
alright find out what that about

74
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:34,699
marijuana so in 1988 in dr. Allen hall

75
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:39,019
it's lab using night of funding they

76
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:41,209
discovered the first so almost three

77
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:44,900
decades later they found the first

78
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,579
endocannabinoids scepter for THC and

79
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,409
then they were like mmm it's weird that

80
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,480
we have this thing in our bodies that

81
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:52,069
only interacts with a plan why could

82
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,959
that be and then they found the first

83
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,310
endocannabinoid a couple of years later

84
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,200
then they found the second

85
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,390
endocannabinoids scepter then they found

86
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,250
a second and Oh cannabinoid and we've

87
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:04,578
gone on from there but that's all to say

88
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:07,430
this is you know like 30 years old um

89
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,829
this field of research is really new and

90
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,079
it changes really fast which brings me

91
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,269
to I am NOT a scientist I'm not a

92
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,189
researcher I'm not a doctor this

93
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,410
research changes really fast I read a

94
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,850
lot of it all the time if you hear

95
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,430
something you're like that's wrong eight

96
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,770
tell me cuz I want know and B just know

97
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,379
that like it changes a lot and there are

98
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,029
a lot of conflicting information about

99
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:30,600
this

100
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:35,609
so if I say something that sounds wrong

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:38,280
let's explore um okay so moving on to

102
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,560
where is the under cannabinoid system

103
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,359
this is important because the

104
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,069
endocannabinoid system can do so many

105
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,900
different things we hear about it being

106
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:49,000
involved in all these different disease

107
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:53,709
states and a lot of that has to do with

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,579
where it is um so it is found in the

109
00:04:53,709 --> 00:05:00,310
nervous system the immune system and fat

110
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:01,569
skin bone circulating cells the justice

111
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,129
system you've heard of reproductive

112
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:09,490
system it's found everywhere um and so I

113
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:20,069
want to start with does anyone know what

114
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:20,069
the nervous system does anyone not even

115
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,759
[Music]

116
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,610
exactly exactly

117
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,470
that was a description of what the

118
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,180
nervous system does it is the way that

119
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,400
our body communicates and regulating a

120
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,620
lot of other systems there are two parts

121
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,750
to their dinner to the nervous system

122
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,910
there's the central nervous system which

123
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,439
is your brain and your brainstem spinal

124
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,900
cord and then there's the peripheral

125
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,000
nervous system which is all the nerves

126
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:05,439
that run throughout the body so the

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,660
central nervous system is like the

128
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,339
communication hub it receives signals

129
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,840
from all over the body and then it sends

130
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:13,359
out other signals telling the body what

131
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,369
to do it organizes all that information

132
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,400
and regulates everything the peripheral

133
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,660
nervous system is responsible for

134
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:24,579
communicating that information to and

135
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,140
from the central nervous system this is

136
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:28,300
important because the nervous system

137
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,550
does things like regulate our breathing

138
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,110
or heart beating or us looking at our

139
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,780
arms being like I want to open my hand

140
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,850
cool I opened my hand it did it

141
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:40,149
that's awesome that's your nervous

142
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,530
system at work the other system that's

143
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,179
super important when we talk about the

144
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:45,879
endocannabinoids system is the immune

145
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,230
system so the immune system pretty

146
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,459
straightforward we all are pretty

147
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,530
familiar every winter where there are

148
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:52,029
game systems and what they do and it's

149
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:54,429
not just make us feel really shitty for

150
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:56,949
a while it is they are trying to protect

151
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,480
us from invaders and the there are a

152
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:01,060
bunch of different parts of the immune

153
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,379
system the parts that were particularly

154
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,600
interested in for the endocannabinoids

155
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:05,918
system are the B and T cells which are

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,990
like the warrior cells of the immune

157
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,959
system they like go around your body and

158
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,600
they're like you invader die which is

159
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,949
also bone marrow really important in the

160
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,080
immune system and a cannabinoid system

161
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:23,439
is also in your bone marrow cool and all

162
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:26,289
of these other systems so this is the

163
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,910
reason that when we talk about cannabis

164
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,129
and cannabis being therapeutic for a

165
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,950
number of different things that are

166
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:34,449
really not very closely related this is

167
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:35,620
one of the reasons it could be

168
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,750
therapeutic for all of those things

169
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,418
because there are so many places that it

170
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,009
could interact throughout the body in

171
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,599
fact the endocannabinoids system has

172
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,039
been expressed in every organ and in

173
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,320
every system that's been looked at so

174
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,910
far with the exception of but there's a

175
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,300
respiratory center go to Britain and

176
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:57,810
it's not there but it is in most parts

177
00:07:52,300 --> 00:08:00,270
of our brain not all of them um okay so

178
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,310
much and you've all been waiting for

179
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:04,810
what is the under cannabinoid system

180
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,430
I'll start using ECS for

181
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,918
endocannabinoids system and they're just

182
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,050
a little bit faster um there's a lot of

183
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,759
words on this screen and there's also

184
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,590
you know it's a really good question

185
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,969
that's why we're here

186
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:17,259
we're gonna talk about the

187
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,220
endocannabinoids system as it's

188
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,930
classically understood there is a lot of

189
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,460
information about the endocannabinoid

190
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,990
system that is evolving really really

191
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:28,509
rapidly and we'll touch on that at the

192
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,728
end but for today we're going to talk

193
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:33,189
about the to classical endocannabinoids

194
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,860
afters you have a vaild receptor type

195
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,469
one

196
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,288
one cannabinoid receptor type 2cb to

197
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:41,329
their endogenous ligands which are the

198
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:44,569
compounds that our body creates to bind

199
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:46,458
to those receptors and then the enzymes

200
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,440
that synthesize and metabolize those

201
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:50,268
those ligands so those are the enzymes

202
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,339
that like give birth to and break down

203
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,959
the compounds that bind to the under

204
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,160
cannabinoid receptors we're gonna go

205
00:08:53,958 --> 00:09:01,278
into each one of those again don't worry

206
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:04,730
there's also a lot of other parts to the

207
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,950
under cannabinoid system we'll touch on

208
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,528
all of that at the end we're gonna focus

209
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:14,209
on these three parts starting with

210
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:16,939
receptors so this question isn't urine

211
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:19,669
dear to my heart I started at a

212
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:24,529
dispensary because I needed a job mine

213
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:26,179
PhD programs in sociology and I had like

214
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:28,549
two days of training and I walked out of

215
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,859
my science training and I was like we

216
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:34,490
have an endocannabinoid system it's some

217
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,740
receptors on cells somewhere I don't

218
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,509
know what a receptor is like what is a

219
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,948
receptor what does this cell what is it

220
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:43,159
neuron and then like that's when the

221
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:47,899
rabbit hole started so I love this

222
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:50,659
question a receptor let me see what

223
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:53,000
image I put first yes okay cool this is

224
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:55,278
an image of a receptor an actual image

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,828
well an illustration never accepted I

226
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,789
think that this is important because

227
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:59,838
oftentimes people will just be like oh

228
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:03,110
it's like this thing but like it

229
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,820
actually looks like that they were

230
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,459
subjects of a tiny protein on the

231
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,190
surface of a cell that compounds engage

232
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:12,229
with that to tell the cell to do

233
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,959
something or to not do something they

234
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:18,440
allow compounds to have impacts on the

235
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,088
cell the largest family there are four

236
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,560
families of receptors the ones that

237
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:24,199
we're going to be talking about tonight

238
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,049
are g-protein coupled receptors cb1 and

239
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:29,569
cb2 are both GPCRs that all doesn't

240
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:32,179
matter it's called a cook um what does

241
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:35,540
matter is GPCRs are the target of like

242
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:37,669
40% of medicines they are really

243
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:40,319
widespread throughout your body they are

244
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:44,849
one of the oldest families of receptors

245
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,260
and CD 1 is one of the most common G

246
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,470
protein-coupled receptors in our brains

247
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:53,189
which is crazy

248
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:54,060
ok so this is a little illustration that

249
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,640
I made

250
00:10:54,059 --> 00:11:00,629
it's not very good but it does the job

251
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,490
so cb1 and cb2 are widely expressed

252
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,720
throughout the body you can see we've

253
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,220
got a central nervous system the

254
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,389
peripheral nervous system their cb1

255
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,170
actually let's just go that slide all

256
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,819
right here we go

257
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,769
can I have an interceptor type 1 now

258
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,540
we've got a focus on it so that picture

259
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,699
of the receptor is a cb1 receptor

260
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:19,709
g-protein coupled receptors have 7

261
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,180
protein strands that go from the outside

262
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,810
of the settle the inside of the cell

263
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:31,139
when compounds bind to the protein or to

264
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:33,509
the receptor they bind they make the

265
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,919
receptor change a little bit and then a

266
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:38,600
bunch of chemistry happens and it makes

267
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:41,669
a cell go cb1 receptors are most

268
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,470
prevalent and most densely populated in

269
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:45,839
the brain and in many many areas of the

270
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:50,730
brain that are responsible for memory

271
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:54,330
word systems attention emotional

272
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:58,409
responses that's a lot of what we focus

273
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:03,360
on when we talk about cd1 cb1 is what

274
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:04,589
makes you feel high it is a very

275
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,470
important receptors the first one

276
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:11,040
discovered and it plays a major role in

277
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:15,750
pain perception um which is why THC can

278
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:18,029
help some people feel less pain it seems

279
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,649
to do that by altering our emotional

280
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,480
perception of pain which is kind of

281
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,149
interesting and might explain why some

282
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,759
people feel more pain because they start

283
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:29,220
to notice it more it's not actually

284
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,710
killing the pain anyway it's also

285
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,950
present on the olfactory bulb

286
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:37,480
reproductive system and on the skin um

287
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:39,910
moving on to cannabinoid receptor

288
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,740
- I'm so excited that I found a picture

289
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:42,939
of this receptor when I was looking for

290
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,519
a picture of this receptor a couple

291
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,639
years ago one wasn't available I found

292
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,519
one and it was through Creative Commons

293
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,110
so here it is it is just seven protein

294
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,078
strands yeah but it's actually the CVT

295
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,730
receptor and it has something binding in

296
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,489
it which is really cool that green thing

297
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,409
is you know where a compound binds this

298
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,360
is important receptors are

299
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:05,828
three-dimensional shapes and

300
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,389
three-dimensional shapes bind to them

301
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,979
and those three-dimensional shapes are

302
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:11,169
different shapes and so when those

303
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,120
shapes come together and change they

304
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:16,659
have different effects

305
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,209
cd2 what is most prevalent in our immune

306
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:22,149
system so it's found on B cells in our

307
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:23,799
immune system and it is really important

308
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,769
in regulating inflammation throughout

309
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:30,278
the body cb2 does not make us feel

310
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:32,350
hockey but it is of particular interest

311
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:35,730
to many many researchers who want to tap

312
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:39,190
into the benefits of cannabis without

313
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:43,839
feeling high unfortunately that's really

314
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:45,279
hard they are very closely related for a

315
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,019
long time and this is really

316
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,850
controversial

317
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:52,089
cb2 was thought to not be present in the

318
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,430
brain at all but there is some evidence

319
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:56,399
to suggest that it is present in the

320
00:13:54,429 --> 00:14:04,269
brain and it might serve an immune

321
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:05,980
immuno protective function up there but

322
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:07,480
again very controversial this is like

323
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:13,430
where we're at with you can have an ID

324
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:15,889
system alright moving on to

325
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:17,739
Williams all right endogenous ligands

326
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:21,019
let's break it down endo means within

327
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,370
Liggins means a compound that binds so

328
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,278
these are compounds that bind to the

329
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,560
receptors found within our bodies

330
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:30,350
endogenous is the opposite of exogenous

331
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,088
so an exogenously gun would be something

332
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,000
from outside of your body that binds to

333
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,290
receptor it can have annoyed if I don't

334
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,028
can happen to it a cannabinoid from

335
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:43,009
plants would be an excellent example of

336
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:45,289
this so I started looking at receptors

337
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:47,720
and ligands and it was just like words

338
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:49,278
words words words words um but these are

339
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,339
actually really important for it and so

340
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:56,519
I made a little diagram explaining what

341
00:14:52,339 --> 00:15:01,540
they are mmm a Star Wars characters

342
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,539
[Laughter]

343
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:15,200
receptors tell the cell cells do

344
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,149
specific things we don't know why they

345
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,370
do those things they just do the things

346
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,870
that they do which is cool but they

347
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,360
won't do those things without some

348
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,830
motivation and that motivation comes in

349
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,129
the form of compounds or in this case

350
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,839
Star Wars characters so in this case the

351
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,458
cells action restores balance to the

352
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,760
force urgell the whole premise of Star

353
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,919
Wars

354
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,939
I really hope everyone to see this movie

355
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:41,149
otherwise now it really doesn't work

356
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:44,930
okay so Luke Skywalker our you know hero

357
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:47,329
of the moment would be an agonist so an

358
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:50,659
agonist is a compound that binds to

359
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,950
receptor and that tells the cell to go

360
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,629
do your thing

361
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,890
you're awesome you're gonna go do it now

362
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:59,539
um that's Luke Skywalker he's gonna

363
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,528
restore balance to the forest by

364
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:05,419
activating the receptor on the cell um

365
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:08,838
the opposite of that would be an

366
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:11,419
antagonist so an antagonist binds to the

367
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,150
receptor still but it tells the cell

368
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:15,949
don't go and also nothing else

369
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:18,319
find here so nothing can activate you

370
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,180
more or less and that was a little

371
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,840
harder so it's like if the movies didn't

372
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:25,699
get funding like if Luke didn't get

373
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,269
funding if you just like stayed on his

374
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,830
farm with his aunt uncle forever that

375
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:33,470
would be the antagonist so like the

376
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,450
story just doesn't happen this can be

377
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,450
really important for like when a system

378
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:40,070
is overactive if you want to like calm

379
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,560
it down a little bit you can introduce a

380
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:46,100
net agonist to a system and make the

381
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,559
receptors chill heck out we also have

382
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,019
allosteric modulator x' so agonists and

383
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:55,000
antagonists bind to the primary binding

384
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:55,000
site on our septic which begin is

385
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:02,390
sometimes other compounds will bind to

386
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,130
other sites on the side of the receptor

387
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,139
and will change the shape of the

388
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,150
receptor but they won't activate it not

389
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,339
really but what they do when they change

390
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:13,790
the shape is they can make things that

391
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:15,500
bind to it work more or less well so

392
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:18,409
when something changes the shape of

393
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,180
receptor and makes it work better with

394
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,589
the things that find and activate it

395
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,130
it's called a positive allosteric

396
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:27,440
modulator so this compound is changing

397
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,930
the same shape of the receptor to allow

398
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,990
things that bind to it to work better

399
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:36,049
the opposite of that which is kind of

400
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:39,440
like Emperor Palpatine in this movie but

401
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:41,569
the kind of not including him is the

402
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,860
negative allosteric modulator so that's

403
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:45,019
something that binds to the side of the

404
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:47,389
receptor changes the shape and allows

405
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:49,670
and makes it harder for things to bind

406
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:54,050
to the receptor and they work less well

407
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:57,170
this is why CBD makes you feel less high

408
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:59,629
once you if you like taken too much THC

409
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:03,470
CBD is a negative allosteric modulator

410
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:08,320
at cb1 change the shape THC binds less

411
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:10,400
well you feel less high I also included

412
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:15,409
synthesizing enzymes just to like

413
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,940
continue on the road towards explaining

414
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,650
the endocannabinoid system

415
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,870
so if synthesizing enzyme would be an

416
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,330
enzyme that triggers the creation of

417
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:25,189
those ligands in the endocannabinoid

418
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:28,220
system so it's like responsible for

419
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,259
giving birth to the agonists or

420
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,299
antagonists in the system in this case

421
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:34,579
Princess Leia if she didn't send that

422
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:35,839
message Luke would have never gotten it

423
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:38,269
he never would have gone and done the

424
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:41,449
thing so she is kind of responsible for

425
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:43,700
like the whole thing being born which is

426
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:50,150
pretty cool it's not a ligand so um

427
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:54,500
alright and then as a bonus we have

428
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:56,000
Darth Vader who's an inverse agonist we

429
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,759
won't really get much into inverse

430
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,069
agonists in this particular presentation

431
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:05,650
but it is another important function

432
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:08,089
that compounds can have so if an agonist

433
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,890
activates the cell and tells the self do

434
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:12,829
your thing go and do it an inverse

435
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:15,080
agonist does the opposite it's exactly

436
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:16,970
the opposite it tells the cell do the

437
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:19,250
opposite thing if the cell wants to

438
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:22,069
usually go to the right an inverse

439
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:24,500
agonist will be like go to the left and

440
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:27,589
that's what happens in our bodies get in

441
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:31,089
first agonism very very weird okay

442
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:33,709
in addition to all of these things

443
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:36,199
binaries are all false including how

444
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,910
things bind to receptors so something

445
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,039
doesn't just simply bind and tell the

446
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,440
cell to go they can bind more or less

447
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:44,869
well which is why allosteric modulation

448
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,539
is a thing but compounds in and of

449
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:50,689
themselves have a binding affinity so

450
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:54,500
you have a scale from a partial agonist

451
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,240
to a full agonist and this is important

452
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,759
because THC and one of the

453
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,519
endocannabinoids are partial agonists at

454
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,619
the endocannabinoid receptors other

455
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,029
things are full agonists at the

456
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,849
cannabinoid receptors and they have

457
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:09,170
different effects this is important when

458
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:10,939
you're looking at research a lot of

459
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,210
research that done that's done in the US

460
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:17,269
isn't done using THC it's done using a

461
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,529
synthetic cannabinoid often times 155

462
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:22,759
which is a full agonist at cb1 and cb2

463
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:26,778
pretty good standing

464
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:28,940
perfect um okay so partial agonist full

465
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:31,118
agonist partial antagonist full

466
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:40,879
antagonist allosteric modulation

467
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:44,418
synthesizing enzyme lots of words we're

468
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:47,538
gonna move on to endocannabinoids okay

469
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:50,179
so endocannabinoids are compounds that

470
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:53,658
our bodies produce that bind to the

471
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:55,639
cannabinoid receptors there are over a

472
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:57,829
dozen that are named so far but we

473
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:59,118
really only know about two of them and

474
00:20:57,828 --> 00:21:02,088
they were the first two discovered a

475
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:03,978
named amide or a EA and to erect a rocky

476
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:05,118
denial glycerol which I like to say

477
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:06,828
because I had to learn how to say it

478
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:09,858
lowered to AG which is what everyone

479
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:11,028
calls it I like to include the images of

480
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:13,189
the three-dimensional shape with the

481
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:14,388
molecules just to highlight again that

482
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,519
these are three-dimensional shapes

483
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:18,198
binding in three-dimensional pockets and

484
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,778
that's why they can find more or less

485
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:23,149
well they if like if there's a little

486
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:24,528
candy cane shape in the receptor and

487
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:27,318
that little candy cane goes in there

488
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:29,598
perfectly it is a full agonist life it's

489
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:30,888
like not quite a perfect candy cane it's

490
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:31,968
just a little bit of a candy cane that

491
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:33,378
still kind of goes in there and

492
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:35,838
activates it just a little bit that's a

493
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:40,578
partial agonist that's why it's

494
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:44,979
important enough um so you know how you

495
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:48,558
can go for a run some of you some of us

496
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:50,209
and after like a little while the first

497
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,858
mile the first 30 minutes you start to

498
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:54,619
feel really good but only for a while

499
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:56,989
that's a runner's high and they have

500
00:21:54,618 --> 00:21:59,838
shown that after thirty thirty minutes

501
00:21:56,989 --> 00:22:01,999
or more of running men experienced a

502
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:06,608
doubling of an and amide in their brains

503
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:08,749
so this compound and an amide is

504
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:12,528
probably responsible for the runner's

505
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:15,048
high which is pretty cool the reason

506
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:17,239
that our runner's high lasts very very

507
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:17,700
short amount of time is that when endo

508
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:21,209
be now

509
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,459
are released their enzymes to break them

510
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:25,109
down are also released and so there

511
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:28,558
started to be broken down like

512
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:34,578
immediately very very short effects but

513
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:38,308
still very important um an and amide is

514
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:41,548
and it's great oh man I forgot it means

515
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:43,950
to pre enjoyed so the actual name of the

516
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:48,118
molecule means what it feels like just

517
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:54,028
pretty amazing so true AG second

518
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:56,158
compound found seems to be like more

519
00:22:54,028 --> 00:22:58,288
expressed in more tissues at higher

520
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,278
concentrations than Ananda mine and they

521
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:05,219
often play like opposing roles like when

522
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,348
one of them does one thing like is it

523
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:10,950
it's anti-inflammatory and this is the

524
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:14,189
case for when I pick it up I talk about

525
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,709
it later I think an and abide is largely

526
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,989
anti-inflammatory to AG and can be

527
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:21,328
pro-inflammatory and we'll talk about

528
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:23,338
why that's important we want to like put

529
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:27,778
that out there but these two compounds

530
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:29,128
are both millions of the cannabinoid

531
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:31,048
receptors they both bind and activate

532
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:33,689
the cannabinoid receptors but they can

533
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:35,098
have opposing effects which is important

534
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,989
when we talk about what the

535
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:39,858
endocannabinoids system does on a large

536
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:45,828
scale okay

537
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:48,269
metabolic enzymes oh no okay well

538
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:49,950
there's a whole list of compounds you

539
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:52,200
don't really need to know them the most

540
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,578
important are the catabolic enzymes

541
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,389
which are the enzymes that break these

542
00:23:53,578 --> 00:24:01,108
two endocannabinoids down ba and maggle

543
00:23:57,388 --> 00:24:02,338
mag lipase meg yeah they're released at

544
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:05,608
the same time as the endocannabinoids

545
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:08,409
they break them down they eat them if

546
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:10,089
you adjust the levels of those enzymes

547
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,920
end up adjusting the levels of

548
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:16,209
endocannabinoids and that's some of how

549
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,440
like this medicine works so when we are

550
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,319
talking about the endocannabinoids

551
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,049
system these three parts the receptors

552
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,720
the endocannabinoids and the enzymes

553
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:28,149
that synthesize them and break them down

554
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,509
work in concert throughout the body so

555
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:33,970
if you change one of those three parts

556
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:36,910
you will end up with changes in the

557
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,610
other two parts it balances itself and

558
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:41,410
so this is these are all therapeutic

559
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:45,429
targets for medicine and there are

560
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:47,920
different research projects going on

561
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:54,160
manipulating each one of these things

562
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:58,600
for different reasons okay so this is

563
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:00,660
the important question what does it do

564
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:04,959
this is a really hard question to answer

565
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:06,850
especially breaking it down in rap

566
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,160
generalities like we talked about

567
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:12,069
earlier the endocannabinoids system is

568
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,430
expressed everywhere in the body and it

569
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:18,159
does a lot of different things but in

570
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:21,700
general it seems to encourage the body

571
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,640
to maintain homeostasis so it regulates

572
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,410
systems it is like um it's like a

573
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,150
thermostat and I stole this metaphor

574
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:33,509
from Martin Lee my boss so the a new

575
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:37,000
cannabinoid system is like a master

576
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:38,230
thermostat it takes all the diff

577
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,359
information from the different systems

578
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,430
and it makes sure that all of the

579
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:43,869
systems are running in concert what I

580
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,279
was saying about the pro and

581
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:47,409
anti-inflammatory effect of the

582
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,230
endocannabinoids earlier that plays

583
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:52,360
directly into this so you know when you

584
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,460
get a fever your body is trying to kill

585
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:57,099
the germs it's really important that

586
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,630
like you know they don't take root in

587
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:01,929
your body and take over and then you die

588
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,130
it's not good um so it raises the

589
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,110
temperature tries to kill the germs

590
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:08,260
that's awesome but then okay it's cool

591
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:10,919
the germs die but your body can't stay

592
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:14,079
hot forever then your cells will die

593
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,430
which also results in death not good so

594
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,839
there needs to be a system to

595
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:19,180
that system down to bring the

596
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:22,959
temperature down so it's it's like that

597
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:24,700
but everywhere with every system it's

598
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,590
super interesting to try and research

599
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,990
any of this online because it's like the

600
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:31,029
endocannabinoids system and the gut the

601
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,710
endocannabinoid system and respiratory

602
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:33,910
system the end you can have no system in

603
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,980
the reproductive system and it's just

604
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,950
like doo doo doo doo doo doo it does

605
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,880
this everywhere everywhere it's really

606
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:44,950
really amazing um and in order to

607
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:48,060
illustrate this I decided to look at two

608
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,319
conditions and talk about what happens

609
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,779
with the endocannabinoids system in

610
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,230
those conditions

611
00:26:51,779 --> 00:27:00,339
the first being pain and inflammation um

612
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:02,289
so this is one of the primary things

613
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:03,639
that it is thought that the

614
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:06,819
endocannabinoid system regulates in the

615
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,460
body inflammation is implicated in a lot

616
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:11,349
of different diseases there are

617
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,809
degenerative diseases might be related

618
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:15,789
to inflammation autoimmune diseases

619
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:18,220
might be related to inflammation and so

620
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:19,839
finding you and like novel ways to

621
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,890
reduce inflammation is really important

622
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,169
at the end of cannabinoid system

623
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,870
presents a really awesome therapeutic

624
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:28,300
target for that first things first

625
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:30,009
cd1 modulates pain perception what I

626
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:31,930
said earlier about it

627
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:35,589
changing your emotional perception of

628
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:38,740
pain super important but it doesn't seem

629
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:40,689
to have much of a rule the plantation

630
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,500
may be a little bit cb2 on the other

631
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:47,920
hand really seems to play a major role

632
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,869
in modulating inflammation when ananda

633
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:57,340
maya and 2ag binds to it they can have

634
00:27:49,869 --> 00:28:00,639
those opposing effects and yeah one of

635
00:27:57,339 --> 00:28:03,709
the things that is important to note now

636
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,059
as before is it's really hard to find

637
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:08,509
that activates only one of these two

638
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:10,308
things so when you get cb1 activation

639
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:12,589
you also get cb2 activation and fight

640
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:14,990
Somerset a lot of research is being done

641
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:21,230
to look for a cv2 agonist that doesn't

642
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:25,308
activate cv 1 and it's going ok you know

643
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:28,399
we're still learning once they do that

644
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:32,869
scientists are gonna lose their stuff

645
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:34,639
it's gonna be a big deal ok so one of

646
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:37,099
the reasons that we know CP 2 has an

647
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,049
impact in information is they designed a

648
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:40,639
mouse that didn't have cb2 receptors

649
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:41,990
which is something that researchers do

650
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,640
with my cell the time they delete

651
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,140
different receptors or systems or

652
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,480
whatever and we're gonna see what it

653
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,950
does and those mice had elevated start

654
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,558
elevated levels of inflammation that

655
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:54,798
they ended up like having tissue damage

656
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:56,089
and dying so CP tu seems to be very

657
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:59,168
important in regulating inflammation

658
00:28:56,089 --> 00:28:59,168
throughout the body

659
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:10,460
yeah all right yes moving on to Oh

660
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:13,190
actually I wanted to touch on no that's

661
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,899
okay alright metabolism and energy

662
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,600
this was another really interesting

663
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:18,528
thing that I guess like every system is

664
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,908
an interesting system that the

665
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:21,200
endocannabinoid system interacts with

666
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:25,190
but this is another really interesting

667
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,769
one um so the underground system starts

668
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:32,298
developing in fetuses really early on by

669
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:34,639
only 14 and it seems to be responsible

670
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:37,668
endocannabinoids play a role in embryo

671
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,429
implantation in the uterus and then when

672
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:44,330
a baby is born endocannabinoids play a

673
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:46,580
role in supplamine there and that Amanda

674
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:48,788
mine is found in breast milk and when

675
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:51,379
you take an and my doubt of breast milk

676
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:54,369
Mouse pups in the mouse model just

677
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,028
didn't supple and they died so

678
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:57,379
endocannabinoids systems really

679
00:29:56,028 --> 00:30:00,798
important from the very beginning for

680
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:04,690
feeding and cd1 seems to be the real

681
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:07,509
star of this whole aspect

682
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:10,750
the systems like modulates every aspect

683
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:13,059
of feeding from like finding food to the

684
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,819
eating of food to the processing of food

685
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:19,149
to feeling satiated cv1 is implicated

686
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:21,369
and all of that cb2 seems to oppose

687
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,320
those effects so this is another of

688
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:25,239
those like homeostatic things cb1 does

689
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:26,649
one thing CBT does the other thing where

690
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,700
the end of cowboys there's one thing the

691
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:33,120
other and you can have no it does not a

692
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:35,740
thing the opposite thing um but cd1

693
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:39,939
really seems to be important in feeding

694
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:42,640
um when we were hungry

695
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:46,450
and we look at food the endocannabinoids

696
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,780
in our system go way up they start going

697
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,430
up like slowly over the day but then we

698
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:53,799
look at something we want to eat they

699
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,950
just like pop up and then we eat and

700
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,440
then they start to go slowly down now

701
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:02,410
when the system is dysregulated if you

702
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,180
end up with disease namely obesity and

703
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:08,800
on the one hand or anorexia on the other

704
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:10,450
hand people who are obese will have the

705
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,399
same reaction they'll have a spike of

706
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,430
endocannabinoids when they see food that

707
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,920
they want to eat but it doesn't they

708
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:20,110
don't like go down as quickly or as much

709
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,700
as people of normal weight and so that

710
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:23,649
could mean like maybe they're not

711
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,450
feeling it's this sheeted they still

712
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,970
feel hungry even though they shouldn't

713
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,880
be hungry it's just not satisfying in

714
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:33,370
the same way on the other hand people

715
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,750
with anorexia are showing food maybe

716
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:37,419
it's even their favorite food

717
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:39,819
no spike in endocannabinoids they eat no

718
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,860
spike in endocannabinoids so it's just

719
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:45,480
like they obviously aren't having a

720
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:47,559
pleasure reaction to eating food so

721
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,880
manipulating the endocannabinoids system

722
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:52,659
could be a really good therapeutic

723
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,580
target unfortunately it can have

724
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,920
downstream effects so there was a drug

725
00:31:54,579 --> 00:32:00,129
Ramana ban which blocked the cb1

726
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:03,940
receptor that was approved for treating

727
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,770
obesity and it was approved and then

728
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:09,269
quickly withdrawn from the market for

729
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:12,400
negative side effects like suicidality

730
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:14,379
so it's not as simple as just like

731
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,630
introducing something that blocks one or

732
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,740
the

733
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:20,600
their receptor like it's a complex

734
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,279
system so what you do one thing it does

735
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:24,169
that everywhere and have really negative

736
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:27,980
side effects on the other magic and have

737
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:34,340
really positive side effects what I

738
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:36,319
wanted to say that um all right this is

739
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:38,779
the last section and probably most

740
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,399
important to you guys what do you do

741
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:44,299
with all this information it's a lot of

742
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,710
letters and numbers words how do you

743
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,750
impact your system how do you impact

744
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:52,640
your on your cannabinoid system there's

745
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:55,250
the obvious answer let's talk a little

746
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,130
bit about how cannabinoids interact with

747
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,990
the endocannabinoids system so THC is

748
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,310
the most common cannabinoid found in

749
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,710
cannabis something that many of you

750
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:05,990
probably enjoy tonight and it is binding

751
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,090
to both the cb1 and cb2 receptor

752
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,650
throughout your body and doing some

753
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:12,019
really cool things like making you feel

754
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,690
high and maybe making you feel less pain

755
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:16,460
or less nauseous or like just better in

756
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:20,840
general it does some really really cool

757
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:25,910
things TBD on the other hand does not

758
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:28,189
bind to cb1 or CVT receptors it is a

759
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,750
negative allosteric modulator it cd1

760
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:33,080
just how it makes you feel less hi we've

761
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:37,430
had too much and it has an impact on a

762
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:39,289
lot of different receptors and channels

763
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,410
throughout the body which is where we

764
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:44,480
start getting into the non-classical

765
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:46,779
endocannabinoid system so cb1 and cb2

766
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,299
are super small part of the picture

767
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:53,089
there are probably one of the most

768
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:55,549
important ones is the trip family of

769
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:57,619
receptors trip v1 the vanillin receptor

770
00:33:55,549 --> 00:34:00,759
which is what capsaicin binds to in

771
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:05,089
order to make like the heat feeling is

772
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:06,259
CBD also binds to it and it binds to and

773
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:07,909
affects a lot of different trip

774
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:09,530
receptors trip receptors modulate

775
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:14,360
temperature sensation throughout the

776
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:15,919
body and so it can be really effective

777
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,010
for helping with pain

778
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,210
just like capsaicin cream is effective

779
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,750
for dealing with pain but without that

780
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,490
burning feeling which is pretty amazing

781
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,989
but the trip family receptors isn't

782
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,128
currently considered to be part of the

783
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:32,328
under cannabinoid system though that

784
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:34,909
might be changing um yeah all right

785
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:37,099
there's also other ways to manipulate

786
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:39,378
your endocannabinoid system so there's

787
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:42,019
canola mimetic compounds this is a fun

788
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:45,048
word it just means compounds that act

789
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:47,480
like cannabinoids dr. euthanise Oh

790
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:49,548
actually wrote a paper about this there

791
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,789
are a bunch of compounds found in a lot

792
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:56,329
of different plants that activate one or

793
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:58,369
another of the cv receptors or affect

794
00:34:56,329 --> 00:35:00,349
the enzymes that break down and open

795
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:02,599
abdomen is bethe Correia Filene is

796
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:05,930
probably the most interesting of these

797
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:08,390
compounds because it is a selective cb2

798
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:10,969
agonist so talking earlier about how

799
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:12,710
things are not selectively activating c

800
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:14,568
b1 or c b2 if they activate one they

801
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,670
activate the other beta carrier filings

802
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:19,068
seems to only activate c b2 which is

803
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,858
really cool it does that at really high

804
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:24,048
dosages the the levels they were looking

805
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:27,048
at were like 25 to 50 milligrams per

806
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:31,639
kilogram which is a lot

807
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:33,199
it's like 1,200 to 33,000 milligrams of

808
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:36,039
bethe Correia filing in order to get

809
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:40,419
that effect but that's in mice tonight

810
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:42,130
humans there's also another compound

811
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,409
found in black pepper that I'm not even

812
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,720
going to try and pronounce it's a fawn

813
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:48,759
hibbott er sofa breaks down and and

814
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,079
amide it's released at the same time an

815
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,960
antivirus possible for the runner's high

816
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,969
makes you feel good ba breaks down gets

817
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,039
rid of that feeling if you inhibit Fah

818
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:58,569
an antibody sticks around for longer

819
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,389
which means you feel good for longer

820
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:03,820
which is really cool so black pepper

821
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:07,839
again getting both of those compounds

822
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:09,460
which is pretty amazing um people who

823
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,680
looked at a bunch of different plants to

824
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,360
look for cannabis cannabinoids in

825
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,059
particular it can happen with like

826
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,579
compounds they found one in kava kava it

827
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:20,460
seems to activate the cb1 receptor which

828
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:23,920
makes sense if you've ever had kava kava

829
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:29,920
definitely makes you feel high but not

830
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,570
as high as maca Fon hibbott er does that

831
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,690
thing again and antibiotics around for

832
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,789
longer longer and actually a Tanisha one

833
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,079
of the compounds in it is a CB 2 agonist

834
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:40,929
which means it activates those

835
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,000
immunomodulatory effects throughout the

836
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:44,980
body that CB 2 is responsible for so it

837
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,889
could be partially responsible for why

838
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:52,530
echinacea can be effective as like an

839
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:55,119
immune booster another way that you can

840
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:58,600
affect or impact year and an AB note

841
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,489
system electroacupuncture which is not

842
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:03,639
the most common form of acupuncture but

843
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:06,009
still fairly common will boost levels of

844
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:07,000
endocannabinoids in your systems pretty

845
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,570
significantly

846
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,400
double stress reduces and that could

847
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:14,470
have noise in your system there is a

848
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,570
direct correlation between cortisol and

849
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:22,029
endocannabinoids which is awesome for

850
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:25,720
Americans so if you reverse stress you

851
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:27,430
will start to elevate your levels of

852
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:30,699
endocannabinoids again so things like

853
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:32,980
meditation and yoga could help bring

854
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:35,710
endocannabinoids back up to a level as

855
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,510
healthy as we're most of us probably

856
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:40,570
live which is far too stressed out

857
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:42,700
I'm also interestingly massaged doubled

858
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,640
the amount of an android found

859
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:47,439
circulating antibody which was pretty

860
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,179
cool so it's not just someone like

861
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,559
getting really deep into those muscles

862
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:56,469
that feels good it's actually a green

863
00:37:50,559 --> 00:38:00,059
being like feel happy so you know get a

864
00:37:56,469 --> 00:38:03,759
massage all right other considerations

865
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:04,750
the endocannabinoids own which really

866
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,900
rolls off the tongue

867
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:09,309
no cannabinoid own or as Martin likes to

868
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,010
say the endo can have a diode which

869
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:14,289
actually does go off the tongue is that

870
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:18,010
larger system of receptors and compounds

871
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:20,230
and enzymes that cannabinoids endo and

872
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:23,110
plant-based can happen to interact with

873
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:26,380
so not just cb1 and cb2 but the trip

874
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:28,329
family of receptors there's also the

875
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,890
opioid receptors new and delta opioid

876
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:32,440
receptors media interacts with them

877
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:37,000
modulates them makes the opioids either

878
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:39,000
endo or synthetic work better and keep

879
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,650
our there's a bunch of different

880
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,300
receptors also found throughout your

881
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,829
body responsible for a lot of different

882
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,820
things that cannabinoids interact with

883
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:53,549
and gpcrs there are three GPC ours that

884
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:57,309
are all claimed to be the next CC b3

885
00:38:53,550 --> 00:39:00,010
receptor but we'll see which one

886
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:01,000
actually wins GPR 55 is particularly

887
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,850
interesting I

888
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,630
I think it's expressed in it regulates

889
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:10,259
bone growth so an overexpression of GPR

890
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:12,280
55 is found in people with osteoporosis

891
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:15,670
which is not good

892
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,070
fortunately CVD is an antagonist at GPR

893
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:21,220
55 so it can help bring that down which

894
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,680
is pretty amazing um and on the other

895
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:26,379
hand THC seems to be an agonist at GPR

896
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:31,719
55 so you know you win some you lose

897
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:33,579
them and then GPR 18 another really

898
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:36,159
interesting cannabinoid receptor

899
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:38,409
potentially is actually THC has a

900
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,569
stronger affinity for GPR 18 that it

901
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:42,429
does for CB 1 or CB 2 and it could be

902
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,769
responsible for the anti nausea effects

903
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:48,399
that THC is sort of famous for at least

904
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:52,059
in like the chemotherapy world and new

905
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:56,200
cannabinoid tone this term is thrown

906
00:39:52,059 --> 00:40:00,250
around a lot um and basically your spot

907
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:02,799
or refers to the level of receptors

908
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:08,619
ligands and enzymes that are circulating

909
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:10,390
throughout your body it is important to

910
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:12,130
be aware that this is a term that's turn

911
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:15,969
around but it's really poorly defined in

912
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:19,269
the literature basically there is likely

913
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:21,459
like a good level for all of those

914
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:23,590
things to be yet and if things are

915
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,980
overexpressed or under expressed then

916
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,420
you get dysregulation so a dysregulated

917
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:33,639
endocannabinoids system

918
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:42,130
disease most of the time okay that was a

919
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:44,049
lot of information oh oh there okay cool

920
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:47,619
I get this question all the time like

921
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:50,350
where do I learn more and there are a

922
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:51,960
couple of resources online project CVD

923
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:54,309
is one of the only ones that's

924
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,889
relatively accessible for people without

925
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:59,230
a scientific background and I had that

926
00:40:56,889 --> 00:41:01,960
on my presentation before I worked for

927
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:04,690
project CVD I use PubMed in ResearchGate

928
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,389
which are the databases of scientific

929
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,829
white papers a lot of those things are

930
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:10,750
open source if you actually want to dig

931
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:12,519
into the science of it highly recommend

932
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,139
going to PubMed and checking it out type

933
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:15,699
in a new cannabinoid system to see what

934
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:18,639
comes up see what you can read online

935
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:20,889
for free it's a really amazing resource

936
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,750
and your tax dollars fund a lot of those

937
00:41:20,889 --> 00:41:25,690
research projects so it read about them

938
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:27,219
um some researchers to keep an eye out

939
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:31,260
for when you start reading a bunch of

940
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:33,669
research names pop up again and again um

941
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,080
Ethan you introduced me to the

942
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,280
endocannabinoids system so thank you

943
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:39,369
much appreciated

944
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,400
uh doctor you can russo dr. john carlin

945
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:44,529
these are sort of like in order of

946
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,940
accessibility to vincenzo de marzo has

947
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,560
written extensively about the

948
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,929
endocannabinoids system he's based in

949
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,549
italy would highly recommend Rafael

950
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:54,099
Mutulu man actually a really accessible

951
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:56,800
writer he's the guy who the Lu sedated

952
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:58,750
the structure of THC in 1964 Susie

953
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,039
Hillard Allen Collett both amazing

954
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,710
researchers who have written extensively

955
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,000
about the in the cannabinoid system

956
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,659
check them out

957
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,659
and with that

958
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,789
[Applause]

959
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:25,199
all right so we've got time for a

960
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,199
handful of questions cool

961
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:47,469
all right so we got time for a handful

962
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:49,180
of questions so yes I looked into your

963
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:50,649
skin there's a lot of theories about how

964
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:53,469
you're seen like thins the blood brain

965
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,180
barrier or makes THC work better and

966
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:56,709
that is not substantiated in the

967
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:58,419
literature which is not to say that it's

968
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:05,440
not true there's just no research to

969
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:06,940
support it do you do we know has that

970
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,800
research not just really been done yet

971
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,380
yeah a lot of the research on terpenes

972
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,510
is based on aromatherapy studies so

973
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,700
these are studies where a small amount

974
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,470
of atropine is distributed into the air

975
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:19,989
of a room and then people are asked how

976
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:21,730
they feel this is how we know like lynn

977
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:24,009
Elul is calming because it's the most

978
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,510
common Trivium in lavender there are a

979
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,430
couple of studies looking at out turn

980
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:29,350
Ian's interact with our bodies the

981
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:30,699
pharmacology like what they do when they

982
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:35,889
get in our bodies but they're really

983
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:46,929
rare so we don't actually know a lot

984
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:52,549
about there are a lot of mercy together

985
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:55,039
had a very specific happy giggly

986
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:57,560
I mean it's foreign system and like it's

987
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,449
one of those things where I agree with

988
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:51,110
you there's like definitely a

989
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:55,159
correlation I mean so see you can extend

990
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:57,829
the duration of a high for sure but I'm

991
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:59,929
not sure about the metabolism of large

992
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:01,489
amounts of THC I mean anecdotally it

993
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:02,809
would appear that somehow it's being

994
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:08,089
stored in the body and not broken down

995
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:12,559
although that I'm yeah the the enzymes

996
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:14,630
that break down THC in the liver do so

997
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:20,389
in small packets but I'm not sure what

998
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:22,640
the case if that is yeah I got one for

999
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:25,489
ya so so we're all big fans of whole

1000
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:28,579
plant medicine here right and so but but

1001
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:30,589
CBD is not really produced whole plant

1002
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:32,360
in the market very well right either

1003
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:34,579
people are manufacturing it and they're

1004
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:38,599
extracting with co2 which is no longer a

1005
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:41,090
whole plant really and and so there you

1006
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:43,360
know THC is abundant and cheap but CBD

1007
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:47,360
is less oh because everybody's growing

1008
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:49,400
THC for the REC side right so so now

1009
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,440
though we've got all the CBD coming in

1010
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,588
from the medical

1011
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,530
market right and so people are finding

1012
00:45:53,588 --> 00:45:59,380
kind of a tweener to to take their

1013
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:03,490
regular THC based medicine and then

1014
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:07,660
spike it with CBD from him how similar

1015
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:11,019
is taking CBD and spiking your whole

1016
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:13,000
plant like ethanol hash alright yeah how

1017
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:16,389
close to see her two whole plant does

1018
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,798
that get as far as efficacy goes pretty

1019
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:22,179
close I mean it would depend on because

1020
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:23,409
whole plant medicine changes from plan

1021
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,838
to plan we would depend on what your

1022
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:27,909
extracting it from and sort of what

1023
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:31,058
compounds are of interest to you but

1024
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:32,798
just like a whole plant extract like

1025
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:36,910
adding CPT to a whole plant extract

1026
00:46:32,798 --> 00:46:40,838
still retains all of the like effects of

1027
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:42,969
the whole plant extract it's just it if

1028
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:44,318
it was a CBD based will plant extract

1029
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:46,808
you would hope that all of those things

1030
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,029
that are already you're already taking

1031
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:51,099
are in that extract as well so it would

1032
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,890
be pretty similar I guess right so so

1033
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:55,660
it's definitely worth using yes and the

1034
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:58,868
question is whether or not the does

1035
00:46:55,659 --> 00:47:00,670
support support supporting novel

1036
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:01,930
cannabinoids of CBD are also in that

1037
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:04,180
other plan exactly

1038
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:05,828
yeah although it does seem like THC and

1039
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:09,250
CBD have a particularly synergistic

1040
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:11,289
relationship there was a study that is

1041
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,358
being done at Harvard which is amazing

1042
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:17,039
so there was this study a while ago

1043
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:19,480
about public speaking and how CBD

1044
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,430
impacted the anxiety induced by public

1045
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,548
speaking and it was effective but the

1046
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:28,690
doses were like 300 and 600 milligrams

1047
00:47:24,548 --> 00:47:30,099
which is a lot of CBD and so people

1048
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:32,710
would always cite that study as being

1049
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:34,539
like Oh CBD is an anti-anxiety compound

1050
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:37,420
it's like well no one's taking 300

1051
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:39,400
milligrams he but Stacy Gruber at

1052
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:42,269
Harvard is in the middle of a study

1053
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,329
where she used 30 milligrams to see me

1054
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:47,340
like 0.3 milligrams of THC and found

1055
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:50,460
anti-anxiety effects for both chronic

1056
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:52,800
and acute anxiety so an even though it's

1057
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,030
hard to get at them in the market so far

1058
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,360
we've actually been doing patient

1059
00:47:54,030 --> 00:48:00,510
studies all summer on CB G which has a

1060
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,849
fantastic anti-anxiety Kemp component

1061
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,740
but specifically for social anxiety and

1062
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:07,799
public speaking it makes you feel

1063
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:10,229
capable like you can handle this so the

1064
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,150
first you know real commercial CVG is

1065
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:17,329
being grown this summer and everywhere

1066
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:17,329
this fall yes

1067
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:23,550
all other most other can have a new into

1068
00:49:20,608 --> 00:49:26,569
that develop in the plant develops from

1069
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:29,400
CVG Canada Jarrell is what it stands for

1070
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:31,080
its present in higher quantities and

1071
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,608
immature plants although now there are

1072
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:38,940
breeders who are growing plants that

1073
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:40,710
will only express CBG it is a secondary

1074
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,139
cannabinoid it's not particularly well

1075
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,570
studied yet it seems to have I mean

1076
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:47,069
anecdotally anti-anxiety effects it's

1077
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:52,590
also being looked at for its antioxidant

1078
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:54,539
effects so it also helps lutein there on

1079
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:56,100
muscular pain we're finding and the

1080
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:57,420
studies that we did on match on this

1081
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,789
summer it's really crazy because we have

1082
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,760
this lightning of neuromuscular pain and

1083
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:05,130
an increase of the feeling of capability

1084
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,560
like I can overcome this which somehow

1085
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,570
also helps with the pain and they're

1086
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:11,699
together so sorry again it's all

1087
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:13,050
anecdotal it's just us making a methyl

1088
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:15,239
hash oil handing it out with

1089
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:17,130
questionnaires so it's like that but CBD

1090
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:20,219
is definitely also a compound of

1091
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:22,500
interest for anxiety and one that has

1092
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:26,549
more substantial scientific literature

1093
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,920
associated with although you might very

1094
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:30,840
much a very minor one yeah if you really

1095
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,320
if you use an isolate of CBD regardless

1096
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,600
of condition you might need a much

1097
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,420
larger dose than taking something that

1098
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:43,579
has a small amount of THC or a full

1099
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:43,579
spectrum thank you

1100
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:58,059
stay away from something

1101
00:50:53,909 --> 00:51:00,278
oh okay so at one point I didn't

1102
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:02,650
actually touch on all fight open avenues

1103
00:51:00,278 --> 00:51:03,998
our anti have been shown to be

1104
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,579
anti-inflammatory but not

1105
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:08,558
pro-inflammatory only and novena boyd's

1106
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:10,960
have both effects and researchers don't

1107
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,249
really know why phyto cannabinoids plant

1108
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,259
basically nowadays don't have a

1109
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:15,429
pro-inflammatory effect they simply they

1110
00:51:14,259 --> 00:51:18,849
will only have an anti-inflammatory

1111
00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:28,509
effect on every cell so I I wouldn't not

1112
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:33,068
worry too much about that yes I tried to

1113
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:36,068
write an article about that so the

1114
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:37,599
theory so cannabinoids are typically no

1115
00:51:36,068 --> 00:51:38,318
phenolic compounds they're basically

1116
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,119
terpenes

1117
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:44,710
um which might have evolved for a number

1118
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,249
of different races so they're all

1119
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:51,099
expressed in the trichomes on the flower

1120
00:51:47,248 --> 00:51:53,230
trichomes have also evolved for baby a

1121
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:56,318
couple of different things potentially

1122
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:57,969
to protect against the Sun potentially

1123
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,759
to protect against pests a lot of

1124
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:04,959
terpenes are like bitter a lot of these

1125
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:06,400
compounds cannabinoids included are in a

1126
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,259
family of compounds that are very

1127
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,119
commonly produced by plants to regulate

1128
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:13,239
a lot of systems like growth and cell

1129
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:16,170
life cycles so there's any number of

1130
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:16,170
reasons that they might have

1131
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,989
[Music]

1132
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:51,669
literally no idea sorry we got time for

1133
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,670
one more question

1134
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:59,989
yes sir we love Suzy but she did already

1135
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:03,949
ask one so if you're pressing we can't

1136
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:05,839
otherwise we'll go to Suzy but so what's

1137
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:08,329
the rate coming if we were interested in

1138
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:14,720
trying to get some CG how early do you

1139
00:53:08,329 --> 00:53:18,889
think we could pick CVG I mean you want

1140
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:20,899
to try codes to develop for sure I

1141
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:23,420
haven't actually worked with you eat

1142
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,130
early picked cultivars and I don't even

1143
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,289
think that homeworks been done yet I've

1144
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:29,809
only used plant material that has been

1145
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:33,139
bred specifically to only express CBG so

1146
00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:34,969
I think what yeah exactly so so people

1147
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:37,639
have been actually doing that in in Hema

1148
00:53:34,969 --> 00:53:39,799
culture right now a lot picking every

1149
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:46,819
week and running analytics and I mean
