1
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:15,939
in cannabis growing forums there's a lot

2
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:18,160
of trash that's talked about

3
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:20,170
all based bottled nutrients right people

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,579
call me I don't I don't grow as salt sir

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,710
I wouldn't grow with those bottles and

6
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,719
you know especially in the forums that I

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,969
frequent that are all natural growing

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:31,809
technique related right but I think a

9
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:35,049
lot of people they just they they give

10
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:37,049
these family of store-bought nutrients a

11
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:40,988
category without actually understanding

12
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:44,229
why we don't like them right and so I

13
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:47,948
hope that you would review why folks

14
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:51,069
should not consider salt based bottled

15
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:54,128
nutrients and because of how that

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,499
impacts the soil food web yeah I mean

17
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:58,539
they're also salt salt nutrients that

18
00:00:56,499 --> 00:01:01,838
are not in the bottle right now yeah

19
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:03,579
there's just powders that you buy yeah I

20
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:05,049
always tell this story and I got it I

21
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,209
have to be a little bit careful because

22
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:10,890
I don't want to get taken to court yeah

23
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:13,859
but I tell the story about sitting in a

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,239
garden writers meeting once and a

25
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,700
gentleman named Horace magadhan came to

26
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,339
speaking he was the founder of Miracle

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,579
Grow and he got up and gave a talk about

28
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:27,939
Miracle Grow this must have been 25

29
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:29,560
years ago and every garden writer in the

30
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:31,299
United States of America used Miracle

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,549
Grow we get free samples all the time at

32
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,189
something and and sounds like a

33
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:38,170
pharmaceutical industry right and and

34
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:40,599
you know was before the organic movement

35
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:45,280
really really took off before I like to

36
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:47,140
say teeming with microbes but anyway he

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,609
gave us talk and he explained how he got

38
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,930
into the business and he explained that

39
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,519
he graduated the University of

40
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,620
Pennsylvania with a degree in

41
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,329
advertising this is a big tip off of

42
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,400
course and I see there is all the time

43
00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:00,370
and he went to work for a company in New

44
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,080
York that sold butter and he'd learned

45
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,420
about two minutes into the job all

46
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,909
butters to see the difference is the

47
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,280
package you know they put a red label or

48
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,049
agreement you know it's all USDA is all

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,479
green it's all the same but it all comes

50
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,370
from the same place you know senator and

51
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,810
he kept thinking about his his friends

52
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,370
who went to work for Joe heck and

53
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,280
other places where they were having new

54
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,800
some new razor blades everyday uh and he

55
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,209
hated this job and and he would spend

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
his weekend driving around trying to

57
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,140
straighten his head out and one weekend

58
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,289
he came upon a greenhouse that was

59
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:35,119
growing wonderful plants and he asked

60
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:37,039
the guy why why his plants was so

61
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,879
different than the guy said my name is

62
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,709
Otto Stern I have an invention bla bla

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,568
and they decided they were gonna go into

64
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,219
business together and try to sell this

65
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:49,909
stuff and so they put it in the New York

66
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:51,409
Herald Tribune 1952 before and after

67
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:54,310
miracle-gro plant we've all seen them

68
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:56,629
and he made like $20,000 in the week

69
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,219
following Thursday at the Kisa and

70
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:59,959
that's old money - that was old money

71
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,669
and he so he went into the butter

72
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,979
company and he said you know I like you

73
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:07,339
guys they went sailing together bills

74
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:08,810
but I hate this business and I quit and

75
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,950
I'm gonna go in the fertilizer business

76
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,739
and he did and he built up miracle-gro

77
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:19,039
it's probably the number one recognized

78
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:20,810
brand in the world right up there with

79
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,530
coca-cola and Pepsi I have to add and

80
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,750
then he was approached by Scott said go

81
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,000
buy him out in a reverse buy on what

82
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,689
Scott's for like 315 million bucks he

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,919
told us and then he said thank you very

84
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:35,599
much and we all went up to get

85
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,929
autographs and I was standing in the

86
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,060
back and he looked up at bt100

87
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,280
shooting one feels I said yes he goes so

88
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,709
sorry I told that story about the butter

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,979
company my father and grandfather owned

90
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,689
the butter no kidding oh my god and we

91
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,459
became quite good friends as a result of

92
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,500
that talk he gave and he would come up

93
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,140
to Anchorage Alaska and sit in my

94
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,810
backyard my wife Judith arranged to have

95
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,639
10 or 15 gardeners come over one in an

96
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,740
hour and he would interview home and

97
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,599
then the ads would run on a Super Bowl

98
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:09,090
you know he would I think if he was

99
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,549
alive today he would definitely be an

100
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,450
organic gardener he would definitely see

101
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,189
the bad

102
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:18,349
and now I'll answer the question right

103
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:21,269
on you know that this stuff is crap

104
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,320
that's the scientific version scientific

105
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,990
version first of all let's take the

106
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:29,399
large overview you know you know that's

107
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,560
that that ugly map that has the that

108
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,870
zone down there by New Orleans and the

109
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,689
water and a unification isn't redness

110
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,720
all rainbow colors as a pollutant that

111
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,730
that that's nitrogen runoff everybody

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,460
always says it's the farmers but in fact

113
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,379
home growers gardeners but at home

114
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,810
growers are certainly part of it we use

115
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,180
four to five times more nitrogen than a

116
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,269
garden than a farmer does so we're

117
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,699
responsible for that as much as anything

118
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:58,319
you use a teeny little bit of it a teeny

119
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,560
little bit of it hits the root the rest

120
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,480
of it goes out into the war ever and it

121
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,000
pollutes simple as that

122
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,750
the plant doesn't use all that high

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,750
concentration the microbes some of which

124
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,490
will die because the stuff is so heavily

125
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,899
concentrated you know if you took any

126
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,460
kind of 10th grade high school course

127
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,069
and paid attention which most of us

128
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:22,079
didn't in science you know about osmosis

129
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,790
and diffusion and and what happens if

130
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,539
you have a high concentration of salts

131
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:30,810
on one side and a single-cell organism

132
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,730
on the other side and you put them

133
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,250
together what happens is the single cell

134
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,230
water leaves the single cell tries to

135
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,939
loop the salt salt tries to go we're

136
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,200
gonna steal some one dilute the the

137
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,149
water and you want to have an

138
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,920
equilibrium and you end up with son of

139
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:47,099
an equilibrium on it's always at least

140
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,379
one molecule I learned when I wrote in

141
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,590
with nutrients sois one model I feel at

142
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,480
least off but anyway he wind up with

143
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:56,429
this quasi equilibrium but you also know

144
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,560
what the dead microorganism right

145
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,629
because in a cell you know so so you

146
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,430
there either eating like crazy changing

147
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:04,819
the constant natural concentration or

148
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,800
they're getting killed by this stuff and

149
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:10,769
both of those are bad now once they

150
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,069
start to go then you have a you have the

151
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:15,799
entourage effect of bad effects

152
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:18,379
the plants ISM I don't need to do the

153
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,418
extra date thing it's a lot of work

154
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,849
making 5060 percent of my closest

155
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:24,459
photosynthetic energy to produce and she

156
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:28,819
dates I'm going to concentrate on the

157
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:30,680
flower and not worry about that stuff

158
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,569
but it needs to worry about that stuff

159
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,999
because it's not getting what it wants

160
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:37,369
what you know it's getting nitrogen sure

161
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:39,199
it's getting phosphorous NPK high

162
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:41,270
numbers of it and everything else but is

163
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,869
he getting the little nutrients that it

164
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:47,209
needs some micro ones you know that make

165
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:49,339
the right enzyme that does that right

166
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:50,658
it's phenomenal what you need and again

167
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:52,610
the theme of nutrients I highly

168
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:54,468
recommend because teacher we didn't need

169
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,319
to know but what happens inside that

170
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:59,538
cell is influenced by what goes into so

171
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,800
now let's go let's go a couple more

172
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:03,498
steps you could stop with whatever you

173
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,050
want you know if ever I have to rewrite

174
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:08,240
a or do another book it will be called

175
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,399
more teams with microbes one of the

176
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,809
things I'm going to stick in it is known

177
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,639
as now known as rise over fakie you know

178
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:18,588
just in passing

179
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,329
Rezo something I'm really really

180
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:22,668
fascinated by you know I wrote teaming

181
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:25,278
with fungi boy I mentioned all three

182
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:26,838
walks now that's amazing how that is but

183
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,379
it links to all the books are in the

184
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:32,300
description below so go out and buy Oh

185
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:36,680
believe me I'm not making any money my

186
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,569
publisher is the the fungi of course did

187
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,819
this wonderful symbiotic relationship

188
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:43,879
well it turns out that now they're

189
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,959
discovering some of the bacteria and

190
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,229
this is what I'm trying to figure out

191
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,718
how much how often does this happen some

192
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:52,038
of the bacteria do do i talked about in

193
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:54,110
teen with microbes you know they get

194
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:57,168
eaten the things that eat and poop them

195
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,639
out feed the plant you know the plant it

196
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:59,079
puts a charge on it it goes into the

197
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,740
plant

198
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:04,389
timid nutrients Lila what rifle

199
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,900
involves is a completely different

200
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:10,930
system the the bacteria is in the

201
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,758
rhizosphere it goes into the into the

202
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,110
root enters the route through the

203
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:21,759
meristem the area goes into the root

204
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:26,050
takes off its cell wall it is oxidized

205
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:29,500
by the plant cell that strips off the

206
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,569
nutrients it contains the bacteria

207
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,458
continues to move through the plant it

208
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:36,070
goes to the side of the wall

209
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:38,528
it creates or stimulates the plant to

210
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,289
form a root hair the root hair grows the

211
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:43,990
bacteria moves through the root hair and

212
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:46,750
goes out the end of the root hair puts

213
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:50,039
its cell wall back on as it does so goes

214
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,839
into the soil gets more nutrients and

215
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,419
repeats the process so it's it's it's

216
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,790
taking off its outer layer passing

217
00:08:55,419 --> 00:09:00,458
through the not the root zone but the

218
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:02,500
literal root is that - and then comes

219
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,389
out the other side kind of reborn if

220
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,059
it's up against the plasma lemma

221
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:09,850
apparently this gives oxidized which

222
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:11,979
pulls off the nutrients and the next

223
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,040
thing you know it goes back out but what

224
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,800
happens is the root hairs form now we're

225
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,509
not trying to figure out and I got to

226
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,679
stop traveling enough to be a leg in the

227
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:24,009
telephone see if I can find a guy that

228
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:26,649
wrote the papers are these blue hairs

229
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:28,809
only formed as a result of bacteria

230
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:32,139
leaving is this what this is is this is

231
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:35,409
a system that ejects the bacteria into a

232
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:37,088
new area of the soil that's different

233
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,948
from where the bacteria came from so

234
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:42,399
that it can get its nutrients and go

235
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:45,429
back into the root whoa now that would

236
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,899
be simply amazing but in any case we

237
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:50,319
know it does exist and that it's

238
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,669
happening it's very analogous to what

239
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,290
the fungi do

240
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:55,120
they go into the plant they give them

241
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:58,629
the nutrients that are out I mean it's

242
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,060
an interesting coevolution I don't know

243
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:03,370
quite what they call it it's very

244
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,469
similar to micro risin funda it seems to

245
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,269
me and and I want to know a lot more

246
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,290
about it all right I think about how we

247
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:12,579
got into it what the question was but

248
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:14,230
those guys are going out there and

249
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,120
bringing food into the plant and I think

250
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,029
if you use in those heavy miracle-gro

251
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,200
type sauce that's not happening right on

252
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,199
thank you very much that's fabulous

253
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,649
you
