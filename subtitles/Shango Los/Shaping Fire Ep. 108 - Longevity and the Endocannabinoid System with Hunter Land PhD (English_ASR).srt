2
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,859
the radically dysfunctional American

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,798
Health Care System programs us to get

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:15,718
sick get on long-term prescriptions and

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,179
get some expensive body scans until

6
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,980
we're out of money and benefits our

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,899
Health Care system is in shambles after

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,760
the insurance company capture of

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,099
independent hospitals and the

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,260
mismanagement of the coveted pandemic

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,660
more and more people are realizing that

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,899
there is no one coming to save us after

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,659
a life of processed food alcohol stress

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,579
and poor sleep there is no greater

15
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,378
wealth than keeping your health or

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,000
improving your health if you are already

17
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:44,280
at a deficit

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,200
the vast majority of people find their

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,120
way to cannabis medicine after Western

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,739
medicine has failed them

21
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,659
for the 10 years I've been helping

22
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,459
patients nearly everyone who has

23
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,859
approached me for direction and cannabis

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,780
use has already been spent dry by the

25
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,100
Health Care system and given little to

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,140
show for it

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,960
cannabis medicine is still considered a

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,000
last resort for most folks I propose

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,400
that we start looking more at cannabis

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,260
as a preventative a potent source of

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,400
stability both physically and

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,159
emotionally

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,080
for True longevity cannabis can take

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,240
some time to Bear fruits but the results

35
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,579
from early and daily use of cannabis

36
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,399
offers rewards that are often described

37
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,560
as miraculous by traditional doctors

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,320
pairing daily cannabinoids with Whole

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,259
Foods and less alcohol could possibly be

page for this episode during the first

115
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,658
set today we will discuss what longevity

116
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,699
is in practice the mechanics of Aging at

117
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:13,919
the metabolic level how increasing

118
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,139
cellular energetics improves your health

119
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,839
span and how the endocannabinoid system

120
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,660
plays a significant role in all of this

121
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,179
the chunky second set is devoted to

122
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,220
discussing individual cannabinoids their

123
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,800
longevity benefits on particular Health

124
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,840
Systems functional cannabinoid ratios

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,699
and how to go about determining an

126
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,099
individualized dosing strategy to meet

127
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,259
your goals including a vibrant

128
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,139
discussion of using whole plant resin

129
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,000
versus cannabinoid isolate and during

130
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,860
the third short set we will focus

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,839
specifically on a few cautions to

132
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,580
consider when taking cannabinoids to

133
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,978
extend your functional life

134
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,680
welcome to shaping fire hunter

135
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,779
uh thanks so much for having me so you

136
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,519
know getting right into it

137
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,319
um one of the things I like about your

138
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:02,519
presentations is you make this very

139
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:05,219
delicate delineation about lifespan and

140
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,459
health span because so often people just

141
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,979
think about how long will I live

142
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,659
um but but as I get older I realize that

143
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,859
there's a lot of difference in quality

144
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,620
of life

145
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,720
um if I get older and sicker so will you

146
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,040
tease those apart for us so that um you

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,780
kind of set us up for the direction

148
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,300
we're headed in today

149
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:28,138
of course um I think it's a critical

150
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:32,120
distinction living a really long life

151
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:34,860
but not a robust Life field of activity

152
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,780
is certainly a shortcoming right so we

153
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,939
don't want uh to have the situation

154
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:42,959
where we can live you know well over 100

155
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:45,500
years but our last 30 years we're unable

156
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,060
to do the things you know the normal

157
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,300
activities of daily living that we enjoy

158
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,360
that goes to quality of life so a lot of

159
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,639
us researchers we don't just look at how

160
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,800
long something could keep you alive we

161
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,160
look at the quality of life there in the

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,560
middle and interesting enough that kind

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,199
of middle set of Health span measures

164
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,019
mainly around activity level seems to

165
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,020
feed quite well into lifespan generally

166
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,698
so those who are maintain health and

167
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:18,000
health span measures in the middle of

168
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:21,780
Life often as an extension of that

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,019
extend lifespan quite significantly and

170
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,978
and those who extend lifespan often

171
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:32,038
don't have this prolonged

172
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:35,818
unfortunate lack of activity at the the

173
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:37,978
terminal terminal years of their life

174
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,280
so that definitely gives us the idea

175
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:43,379
that you know uh in one case in one way

176
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,019
it might be better to live a higher

177
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,360
quality shorter life than a longer life

178
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,918
that's lower quality because if you're

179
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,520
if you're really getting sicker the last

180
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:56,639
20 years uh it's like increasingly being

181
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:59,159
in a prison and yet you're still alive

182
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,259
exactly you know I think the the goal

183
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,080
ultimately would be both and I think we

184
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:07,020
can achieve both with some level of

185
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,620
intervention and we've seen you know an

186
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:14,099
extensive change in lifespan if you go

187
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:16,319
back maybe 100 to 150 years

188
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,900
you know average life expectancy was

189
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,060
about 35 years uh you know it was

190
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:24,478
riddled with problems around giving

191
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,399
birth uh infections you know lack of

192
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,680
surgery and now we have those things and

193
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,038
we've been able to extend life but

194
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,139
unfortunately the health span remains to

195
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:36,620
be problematic and that kind of those

196
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:40,079
middle years of life and ultimately

197
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,699
impact age-related disease

198
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,098
so I don't think that we need to

199
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,080
convince very many people that living a

200
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,519
long and healthy life is the goal so

201
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,079
that's probably going to be our easiest

202
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,019
thing to you know try to convince people

203
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,939
of today so so let's move right on to

204
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:55,379
the the the the the part of that the

205
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,500
endocannabinoid

206
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,120
um system can play in this you know

207
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,860
um I'm gonna I'm gonna start with how I

208
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,620
normally explain the endocannabinoid

209
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,240
system just because a patient's dig it

210
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,800
um uh but but then I'm going to ask you

211
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,500
to give us like a you know a more

212
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,000
elaborate scientific explanation but

213
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,560
um to people who have never come across

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,598
the endocannabinoid system before I

215
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,000
always say that it's it's very similar

216
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,560
to being a second grade teacher in the

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,879
room you know you've got you've got the

218
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,500
teacher in the room and you've got all

219
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,120
these students and when the teachers in

220
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,259
the room all the kids are pretty much

221
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,240
doing what they're supposed to be doing

222
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,280
but then if the teacher gets called out

223
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,960
of the room the kids might be good for a

224
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,939
few minutes but eventually one kid

225
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,559
cracks up and then another kid cracks up

226
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,020
and then like all the kids are cracking

227
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,338
up and then and then eventually the

228
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,620
teacher comes back in the room and has

229
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,479
to settle everybody back down and our

230
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,459
endocannabinoid system is in the same

231
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,379
way like even you know if if the

232
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,838
endocannabinoid system gets weakened

233
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:50,580
eventually one of the systems that it

234
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,500
moderates will go bad and then another

235
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,420
one will and another one and it may be

236
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,100
different systems

237
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,679
um that are falling out of balance for

238
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,019
different people first but um you know

239
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,958
the chaos increases as they run into

240
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,759
each other so you know you know at that

241
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,439
that explanation would certainly never

242
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,000
fly at one of your scientific

243
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,920
conferences

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,980
um so I I would appreciate it if you

245
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,860
would explain in a more scientific way

246
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,200
um how the endocannabinoid system acts

247
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,419
as the body's Master regulator for all

248
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,420
of these Mission critical systems

249
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:27,360
oh well I think the analogy is is really

250
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,919
interesting and and suitable I I like to

251
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,200
think of it generally the

252
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,778
endocannabinoid system as the rest

253
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,700
relaxed restore system of the body I

254
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:39,000
think that was something that uh Ethan

255
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,019
Russo uh one of my mentors refers to it

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,240
as and I think it's a good

257
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:45,600
representation of of how that system

258
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,700
works if you look at the brain uh the

259
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,360
cannabinoid one receptors these are

260
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,120
receptors that a THC is an Agonist or

261
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,360
activates these receptors as well as

262
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,659
your own body's cannabinoids or

263
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,940
endogenous cannabinoids and that's

264
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:06,419
essentially how the system functions is

265
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,120
by either local activation your own

266
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:11,939
bodies endocannabinoid system or by

267
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,339
external cannabinoids and and THC I

268
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,320
think is is one of the the best examples

269
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:20,640
of of what we would call a partial

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,220
Agonist at CB1 and the way an easy way

271
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,720
to think of this again not trying to go

272
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,240
in too much detail but your brain it has

273
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,759
neurotransmitters that that signal for

274
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,440
effects and these things can be certain

275
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,740
neurotransmitters may act like

276
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,000
stimulants so think caffeine and other

277
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:44,639
neurotransmitters may act like

278
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,799
benzodiazepines so things Xanax and

279
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,100
these are signaling Pathways but if you

280
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:53,299
get too much release of the stimulant

281
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,920
component so that's glutamate or the

282
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:59,219
benzodiazepine the the Xanax like

283
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:02,278
component which would be Gaba things can

284
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,200
go awry because we we don't want these

285
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,879
systems to be out of control just like

286
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,100
your your second graders in the

287
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:11,299
classroom and and the the second grade

288
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,700
teacher so to speak would be your your

289
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:18,599
endocannabinoid system which actually

290
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:21,480
tells these neurotransmitters to stop to

291
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,360
settle down to calm down to not release

292
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,459
as much of this neurotransmitter

293
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,879
essentially like a reset switch for

294
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:32,939
those systems the interesting component

295
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,399
is this happens on a very localized

296
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,260
level so you're not reprimanding the

297
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,620
whole classroom room your body doesn't

298
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:43,319
you know punish all the kids if only two

299
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,919
of them were bad it only focuses on

300
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,540
those two bad children or the two uh the

301
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,360
small section of neurotransmission

302
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:53,699
that's gone awry the important

303
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,240
difference here is when you take a

304
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,920
exogenous cannabinoids so like THC it

305
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,159
can down regulate

306
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:05,939
all of that system so the stimulation

307
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:08,399
and the inhibitory or the the xanax-like

308
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,279
effect which can be problematic if you

309
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,440
if you use too much uh then that's where

310
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,000
you get massive anxiety and paranoia so

311
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,760
it's a very

312
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,620
um particular system

313
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,958
that can be regulated well on its own

314
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,839
and in many cases may need to be

315
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:29,159
regulated or can people can benefit from

316
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,899
regulation uh using something like THC

317
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:32,399
so we're not going to dwell too much on

318
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,200
the mechanics but I do have a couple of

319
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,600
a couple other questions to go down this

320
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,140
path before before we switch

321
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,139
um you know often we will talk about uh

322
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:46,078
certain cannabinoids uh being in an

323
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,940
Agonist or an antagonist and my

324
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,219
understanding is an Agonist essentially

325
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,860
is turning on something or an antagonist

326
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,139
is turning off something and often you

327
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,940
know lay people will talk about

328
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:00,180
um you know this or that cannabinoid

329
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:03,000
turning on or off a receptor

330
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,199
um causing a particular effect or

331
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,200
another

332
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,500
um is it is it really like that black

333
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,839
and white zero and one do do do do these

334
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,600
end agonists and antagonists really just

335
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:19,320
flip a switch and it's either a or b or

336
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:23,700
is it more analog where there's a range

337
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,940
of of how much it is being at agonized

338
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,160
or antagonized yeah absolutely there's a

339
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,200
tremendous range and and you know we

340
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,778
could probably do a show on just that

341
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,879
component or just that question which uh

342
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:39,958
I think we'll we'll skip some of those

343
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:42,720
details but the the degree to which you

344
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,778
stimulate or agonize a receptor or block

345
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,920
it uh can be very powerful or it can be

346
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:52,200
more gentle right so THC is not a very

347
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,379
potent Agonist it doesn't it's not like

348
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,500
a sledgehammer for your your CB1

349
00:13:55,379 --> 00:14:01,220
receptor there's some synthetic

350
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:05,039
cannabinoids like spice and K2 that are

351
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,560
extremely inebriating and very potent

352
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,559
and very dangerous and can cause a lot

353
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:15,719
of side effects there's also antagonists

354
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:19,259
so at lower doses thcv so similar to THC

355
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,000
but with two less carbons on the tail it

356
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:25,559
can be an antagonist so it can actually

357
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,679
block your endocannabinoids and May lead

358
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:31,379
to a very different effect there was a

359
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:34,379
drug called Ramada band that was

360
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,000
designed to be an antagonist and

361
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:38,639
unfortunately it's something we call

362
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,220
inverse agonists so it's not like THC I

363
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,600
think is the the important point and and

364
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,600
what happened with that particular drug

365
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,459
is it caused increase

366
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,980
suicidal ideation so people were

367
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:52,500
depressed some people were depressed and

368
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,480
some people had Suicidal Thoughts they

369
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,940
also lost weight and seemed to help

370
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,199
regulate blood sugar and a couple other

371
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,899
aspects so your point of how strong

372
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,698
something is at either blocking a

373
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:09,240
receptor or stimulating receptor

374
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:11,519
especially as it relates to medicine and

375
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,600
and health outcomes is of critical

376
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,419
importance

377
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,139
so circling this mechanics conversation

378
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:20,879
back to this idea of longevity and um

379
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,198
you know that that bigger holistic

380
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,799
picture

381
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:25,679
um

382
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,078
you know when we think about the

383
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:32,458
endocannabinoid system and its ability

384
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:34,019
to to you know uh uh turn on and off

385
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,759
different systems to bring them into

386
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,740
balance things that are running hot it

387
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,659
can have it settle down or if something

388
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,639
is too sluggish it can suddenly be

389
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,679
stimulated by the endocannabinoid system

390
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,360
most of us

391
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,879
um you know folks who are cannabis

392
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,800
enthusiasts but are not researchers

393
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,740
um you know we we throw around the ideas

394
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,139
of the CB1 and CB2 receptor you know

395
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,539
pretty pretty liberally even if if not

396
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,039
necessarily scientifically accurate just

397
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,539
so that we can un you know generally

398
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,159
understand

399
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:05,458
um how to dose ourselves one way or

400
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:09,059
another and um and and I know that um

401
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:10,919
you know CBD doesn't really act upon

402
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,078
those receptors and yet we still

403
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:16,078
consider it part of the endocannabinoid

404
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:19,078
system which which clearly suggests that

405
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,539
the endocannabinoid system is made up of

406
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,698
more than just these uh

407
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:26,278
neurotransmitters and and these two

408
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:28,198
receptors now now I know again it would

409
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:30,059
be an entire show to ask you to review

410
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,099
all of the parts the endocannabinoid

411
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:33,599
system but what I'm what I'm looking for

412
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,659
is is

413
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,240
um for you to just give us a a quick uh

414
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:40,980
survey of of who makes up the

415
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,320
endocannabinoid system like what parts

416
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,579
because in in you know in in a little

417
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,500
bit in the show we're going to be

418
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:48,778
talking about how we're working with the

419
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,100
endocannabinoid system and I want to

420
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:51,539
make sure that people understand the

421
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,720
reach

422
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:57,958
sure well the endocannabinoid system is

423
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,778
is heavily uh integrated with so many

424
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:03,719
other systems in your body it can couple

425
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:06,179
or affect Upstream Downstream things

426
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,120
like serotonin which is associated with

427
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:12,059
depression dopamine which I think we're

428
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,938
all well versed and and what dopamine uh

429
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:18,379
actions of dopamine are but also

430
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:21,779
critical roles and inflammation and mood

431
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,900
sleep so you know it's it's heavily

432
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:28,379
integrated so I I've personally like to

433
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:32,580
think of the endocannabinoid system in a

434
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,679
classical case so just CB1 and CV2 in

435
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:36,899
the endogenous ligands so the

436
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,660
cannabinoids that your body makes and

437
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,940
then the Transporters whether that's

438
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,298
because you have to get these from point

439
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,480
A to point B and they're all Targets for

440
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:51,000
potential making of medicines and and

441
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,019
maybe plant molecules modulating these

442
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,960
systems

443
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:57,418
once you go outside of that then you

444
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,058
start calling a lot of different things

445
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:04,700
the endocannabinoid system so for

446
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:08,038
instance trip receptors trp receptors

447
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,220
especially trip V1 we know is activated

448
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,720
by cannabinoids and sometimes

449
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:16,319
desensitized that's the same receptor

450
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,620
for the spicy taste right and that's

451
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:22,159
actually an ion channel so that's just

452
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:25,199
an example of another system altogether

453
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,038
that cannabinoids can function at but

454
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,919
isn't necessarily A what I would

455
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,960
consider the classical

456
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,000
endocannabinoid system

457
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,759
but to your point there are tons of

458
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,240
targets especially for CBD we know there

459
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:45,480
are about 68 different targets meaning

460
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,298
places where CBD may work or function in

461
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,400
the body and almost all of those are

462
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:54,240
outside of the endocannabinoid system

463
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,559
and the same can be said for probably at

464
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,759
least a hundred of the other

465
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:03,000
phytocannabinoids found in cannabis that

466
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,980
their principal role is probably not CB1

467
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,099
or CB2

468
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,440
so so in a way of summary will you make

469
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:13,379
the case rule for me real quick uh make

470
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,140
the case that for for somebody wanting

471
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,799
um to you know increase their health

472
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,660
span why working with the

473
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,759
endocannabinoid system is a great place

474
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,019
for you to be working

475
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,538
well I think you know the

476
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,759
endocannabinoid system is as I mentioned

477
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:32,538
the rest relax restore system of the

478
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,099
body it's the importance around

479
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:38,000
inflammation and the immune system is

480
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:41,038
critical and when we think about

481
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,440
age-related diseases a lot of these are

482
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:46,980
mediated by our body's inflammatory

483
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,860
response autoimmune response and and

484
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,740
things that have gone awry so if your

485
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:54,959
body's able to keep these components in

486
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,500
check then maybe you do have better

487
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,480
health span and and lifespan measures by

488
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,700
just keeping everything in this nice

489
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,298
balance of where it should be in

490
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:09,720
homeostasis and not outside of that I

491
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:13,079
think that's a certainly a a has strong

492
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,779
potential for extending life and and

493
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,000
activity and secondly I think there's a

494
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,038
big role for cannabinoids and

495
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,980
endocannabinoids around mitochondrial

496
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:25,019
health and mitochondria if you remember

497
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,240
back to grade school or the PowerHouse

498
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,798
of the cells so as these things go into

499
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,279
decline

500
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,740
um you know you have problems with

501
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,440
cellular energetics which if you don't

502
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,599
have energy for your engine of your cell

503
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,038
then kind of everything starts to go

504
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,038
awry

505
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:47,400
when when people talk about

506
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:49,440
um you know cannabis medicine and all

507
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,259
the things that it can help

508
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,500
um people new to cannabis medicine will

509
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:57,779
also have often have this reaction that

510
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,759
um oh you think cannabis is a Panacea

511
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,859
you know it's it can just cure

512
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,720
everything that's ridiculous nothing can

513
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:06,959
cure that much and and what I tell them

514
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,058
is it really only helps one thing it it

515
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,120
helps balance the endocannabinoid system

516
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:14,579
and and and the issue is that all of

517
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:16,678
your body's systems play into the

518
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:19,439
endocannabinoid system so really the

519
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,120
canvas plant really has one job which is

520
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,340
to keep the endocannabinoid system in

521
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,500
balance and and in my head I always

522
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:27,000
think of it as you know the Endo the

523
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,339
only thing that you can do other than

524
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,038
the endocannabinoid system that can have

525
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:35,519
such far-reaching effects to heal and

526
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:38,400
restore the human body is eating a Whole

527
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,259
Foods diet because that too reaches

528
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,659
every part of your body

529
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:46,500
um how does that set for you

530
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,419
well I I think it's an interesting point

531
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,240
um I first thing I would like to say is

532
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:54,538
cannabis is not cannabis is not cannabis

533
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,440
right because we know that there are I

534
00:21:54,538 --> 00:22:00,359
think last time I checked about 545

535
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,000
potentially active compounds that can be

536
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:05,839
found in cannabis and we estimate right

537
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,099
now there may be up to 150 different

538
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:11,459
phytocannabinoids and they're all very

539
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:14,099
unique right so when we use cannabis as

540
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,100
just a plant it is a very unique plant

541
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:19,558
because of the compounds it produces

542
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:22,678
these are things like terpenes and

543
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:24,658
terpenoids and flavonoids and obviously

544
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,659
cannabinoids as well as a lot of

545
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:29,400
components that were not even really uh

546
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:32,159
well versed in as of yet the science

547
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,860
hasn't really directed us to examine all

548
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,860
these components and and with that being

549
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:41,219
said the complexity is which of these

550
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:43,079
components worked well well where and

551
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,860
how does that affect disease

552
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:48,960
so to your point if we're talking THC

553
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:51,418
and some of the other cannabinoids then

554
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,519
then you know endocannabinoid system may

555
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,500
be critical but if you look at something

556
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,700
like CBD I would I would make an

557
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,798
argument for uh the principal areas of

558
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,440
action are not

559
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:07,079
um directly related maybe upstream or

560
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,360
Downstream but not directly related to

561
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,720
the endocannabinoid system so again

562
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:16,079
another level of complexity

563
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,298
um to a very very complex situation I

564
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:22,139
agree with your statement about food I

565
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:23,960
have a deep interest in nutrition I

566
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:28,320
would also add

567
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:31,558
exercise and potentially fasting to that

568
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:35,700
as having a systemic a beneficial effect

569
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:38,099
to treat multiple diseases

570
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,558
um I've heard you talk before about

571
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:43,980
um you know that the aging process as

572
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:47,399
part of this overall topic of living a

573
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,798
longer healthier life and um and people

574
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,860
often think talk about like the body's

575
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,779
clock and and how you can turn back the

576
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:56,459
clock or stop the clock or you know

577
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,798
different ways that that people use that

578
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,500
turn of phrase and

579
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:04,798
um I'm curious at a I guess a

580
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:08,460
biomechanical level what does the the

581
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:11,220
the the body's clock

582
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,900
um what what is that mechanism you know

583
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,880
in passing I've heard people say oh

584
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,400
folate is the body's clock but like I

585
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,580
don't actually know what that means

586
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,159
oh man this is uh I think there's a lot

587
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:25,740
of components to dive into here

588
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,260
um when you talk about body's clock a

589
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,480
lot of this has to do with um their

590
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:33,558
compounds within cells called sirtuins

591
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,839
and they regulate something called

592
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:39,298
epigenetics and you can think of this uh

593
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,099
the genetics is kind of the recipe and

594
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:43,679
the epigenetics

595
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,379
um it could can either cover portions of

596
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,700
the recipe or uncover them for

597
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:53,100
production of critical components

598
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,080
for health span and lifespan so your

599
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:58,619
body basically looks at the recipe and

600
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:01,500
makes what it needs over time those

601
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:03,719
recipes get damaged and

602
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,119
um to the degree that cannabinoids play

603
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,960
a role interacting with these sirtuins

604
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:12,119
and helping regulate these genes isn't

605
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,759
incredibly clear but I think when people

606
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:17,339
largely when people talk about their

607
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,859
bodies clock uh they're they're thinking

608
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:22,918
about how this information gets damaged

609
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:23,959
over time and then measuring lengths of

610
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:27,299
things

611
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,240
called telomeres where you can get a

612
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:33,058
kind of a biological age and they seem

613
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,819
to map some of these compounds seem to

614
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:39,538
map with biological age which is very

615
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:43,200
different than chronological age

616
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:44,519
so um so if I were to summarize that

617
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,860
like you know if I was talking to a

618
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,900
friend or somebody I I would say that

619
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:52,859
you know our when we're young or when

620
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:57,179
we're born our body is born with a um a

621
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:59,459
set of recipes to to make various

622
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:03,778
um you know chemicals and parts that

623
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,480
make us human and and as we get older

624
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:08,880
um that the recipe book

625
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,839
um starts to get uh corrupted over time

626
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,720
and so the recipes don't get made right

627
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:18,119
anymore and and therefore the

628
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,538
functioning uh continues to degrade

629
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,439
until you know the souffle flattens and

630
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,079
we die

631
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,179
um is is that is that one way to say

632
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,220
what you're saying sure I think that's

633
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,659
one way you start out making chocolate

634
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,620
chip cookies and and you know at the end

635
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:36,419
they don't look anything like chocolate

636
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:39,298
chip cookies because you've got this

637
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:41,278
disrupted recipe and I think that's

638
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,480
that's one component and the other

639
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,179
component

640
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,620
um you know has to do with cellular

641
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:51,538
energetics and and also the cleaning of

642
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:54,119
of the cell so getting rid of the bad

643
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:57,058
and coming in with the new and and that

644
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:59,339
also gets damaged over time the your

645
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:02,399
body's ability to heal which I think

646
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:05,038
everybody can can agree that you know an

647
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,860
80 year old individual does not have the

648
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,558
same ability to to heal their injured

649
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:12,658
knee as you know a 10 year old and that

650
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,720
ability declines over time for for

651
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:18,480
multiple reasons and some of that is

652
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,058
your own body's adaptation to to

653
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,720
Cleansing the bad and bringing in the

654
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:24,119
new

655
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,400
if as we age

656
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:30,538
um our the recipes are getting corrupted

657
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:34,019
and and and and what we want is thriving

658
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:36,919
cellular energy energetics

659
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:40,619
um so that we have a longer Health span

660
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:43,759
what what is it that is degrading these

661
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:48,359
recipes that potent cellular

662
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:49,859
energetics is able to undo or defend

663
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,918
against

664
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:54,719
I think it's a great point A lot of

665
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,000
people are investigating this I mean

666
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,339
there are some people that just have

667
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,859
great genetics from the start these

668
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,599
centenarians you know that live over a

669
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,399
hundred a lot of them have smoked

670
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,918
cigarettes their whole life and maybe

671
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,980
drink too much Etc but they were just

672
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,380
you know blessed with uh you know this

673
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,440
genetic predisposition of just having

674
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:19,380
this really robust uh genetic system

675
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,480
that takes care of their their uh the

676
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,419
health of their DNA and their cells but

677
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,460
for most of us we don't have that and

678
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,980
the things that we can control are

679
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,919
largely environmental so that's what we

680
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,440
put in our body the amount of rest and

681
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,520
sleep that we get

682
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,740
the toxins that that may be around us

683
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:43,200
and activity level and I think those are

684
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,940
that pretty much sums up

685
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,460
um you know

686
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,558
the

687
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,620
outcomes of how well we can maintain

688
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,460
these recipes and the cellular Health as

689
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,439
we age

690
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,140
you know it's kind of ironic that that

691
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,900
even though you know the the underlying

692
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:04,380
kind of point of the discussion today is

693
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:07,980
is you know growing and using uh

694
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,440
cannabis medicine as a a supplement can

695
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,500
increase your health and your your

696
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:16,140
health span at the same time

697
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,480
um it's not lost on me that we keep on

698
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:22,080
coming back to the best thing that you

699
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,500
can do for your health span is to uh eat

700
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:28,319
well sleep well and exercise and and

701
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,240
except for maybe you know Whole Foods

702
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,038
more or less like those are all those

703
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,500
are free things right those are things

704
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:37,259
that don't cost money and yet they're

705
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,000
the hard thing to do and so people are

706
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:40,500
all like you know I still want to stay

707
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,700
up too late I would still like to eat

708
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,919
like crap I don't really want to

709
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,500
exercise but I would really like to buy

710
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,659
this bottle of vitamins and just eat

711
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,798
these and get away with living my crappy

712
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:52,080
life

713
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:54,119
right right it's much easier yeah and

714
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,240
and we see that you know with with

715
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:00,479
modern medicine uh you know for instance

716
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,919
some patients that are diabetic may be

717
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,778
able to manage it

718
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,299
um with diet and exercise

719
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:08,038
um and I'm not a physician so you know

720
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:09,720
consult your physician before you do any

721
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:11,220
of that but it could in the early stages

722
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,440
is

723
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,839
potentially be managed with diet and

724
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,538
exercise but it's much easier to take a

725
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,418
pill or a shot or take a medication than

726
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:25,200
to put all that effort into controlling

727
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:27,240
something uh more naturally right on so

728
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,360
um with that said we certainly recommend

729
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,240
a Whole Foods diet exercise and uh and

730
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:36,599
good sleep but we also want to be able

731
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,819
to um you know do the best we can and so

732
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,558
we're going to continue the conversation

733
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:43,139
now and talk about

734
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,058
um you know some cannabinoids and and

735
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,960
what their mechanics look like in the

736
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:48,599
body

737
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,538
um to support this uh this increasing

738
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,158
Health span that we want to get now

739
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:56,898
um you know yeah there's there's you

740
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:59,039
know 545 compounds and and 150

741
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:01,379
phytocannabinoids and clearly we're not

742
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,000
going to go through them all today and

743
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,360
and you know I don't really think we

744
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
need to either because for for most

745
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,339
listeners we're really only going to

746
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,500
have access to

747
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:19,319
um you know CBD THC CBG and then whole

748
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,359
plant resins that will have a smattering

749
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,759
of these other phytocannabinoids in it

750
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,979
which we may not even know about because

751
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,319
they might not be testing form in the

752
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,240
COA so

753
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,639
um so we'll just 100 yeah well so let's

754
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,620
just focus on these because this is what

755
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,820
people really have access to and so we

756
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:38,519
might and I don't want to I want to keep

757
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:40,019
this relevant to real people you know so

758
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,898
so so since you've already started

759
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:45,359
talking about CBD and the plethora of

760
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:48,119
targets I think you like said 68 or

761
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:50,219
something something like way bigger than

762
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:51,898
um most people take for granted

763
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,000
um um and I'm I'm we're going to start

764
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:55,859
with CBD and then I'm gonna hit like all

765
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,720
you know all of the next three but but

766
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:01,379
let's start with CBD

767
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,960
um what is it that we are hoping that

768
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,840
CBD does you know when people ask me I

769
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,500
just generally say we want the CBD

770
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:13,558
supplement as an um to re that we get

771
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,778
from the plant to replace an endogenous

772
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:17,339
cannabinoid That We're Not Making or

773
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:19,500
that we're depleted in or we don't have

774
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:21,538
enough of so so our our body doesn't

775
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,538
have enough and so we take CBD to

776
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:27,419
replace it and and then it helps keep

777
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:31,379
things in Balance how would you discuss

778
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:33,000
it as a as a cannabinoid researcher

779
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,500
I would um

780
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,259
I would discuss it a little bit

781
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:41,179
different because most of my work around

782
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:44,038
CBD has been in treating disease and

783
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:46,080
primarily you know the the at least the

784
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,419
initial work I've done with CBD was an

785
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,879
epilepsy specifically a lot of

786
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:53,759
refractory childhood epilepsies like

787
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,740
Gervais and Lennox Gusto where these

788
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,919
children had failed you know 14

789
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,019
different modern medications and were on

790
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,380
three or four and still having hundreds

791
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:07,079
seizures a month and we do see CBDs

792
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,820
quite effective generally reducing about

793
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,339
50 percent of seizures with some

794
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:13,619
patients being seizure free and it

795
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:15,959
doesn't work like these other anti

796
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,979
-epileptic drugs or these anti-seizure

797
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,019
drugs

798
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,019
that's I think the the

799
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:24,240
really clear component is that we know

800
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:27,419
that it is safe and effective for

801
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,460
seizures but these doses are much higher

802
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:32,100
than what you would take CBD as a

803
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,079
supplement so in the clinical trials you

804
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:37,019
know patients were taking you know

805
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,298
between 500 and 1500 sometimes more

806
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:42,480
milligrams of CBD a day

807
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:44,759
now would that be lower if it was a

808
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,558
whole plant extract I think it would

809
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,500
have to be lower because the whole plant

810
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,678
extracts contain THC would that be

811
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,898
better it's certainly possible that it

812
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:58,080
would be better but but again we would

813
00:33:54,898 --> 00:34:00,898
really need to do that research THC is

814
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,699
also an anti-convulsant so as you and

815
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:04,500
your listeners probably know if you're

816
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,720
getting a whole plant extract the

817
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,838
overwhelming majority of them still have

818
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,760
some THC present which which may be a

819
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,159
benefit to some patients with epilepsy

820
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,320
it could also be Pro convulsant to some

821
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,559
patients and it may be of critical

822
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,159
importance to areas like pain and and

823
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,679
maybe areas like anxiety now as you go

824
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:29,179
down in doses there's been some evidence

825
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,619
that CBD is a is a pretty powerful

826
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,139
anxiolytic we've seen that for things

827
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:36,240
like public speaking they haven't done

828
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:38,760
any work with podcasting yet but maybe

829
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:42,898
that's a that's an option we do see that

830
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,060
the anxiety tends to go down in several

831
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,638
studies and that seems to be at lower

832
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:49,980
doses if you bring that dose down

833
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,280
further to let's say 25 milligrams

834
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,960
they're really hasn't been a lot of

835
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,960
research to say you know what do these

836
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,480
low doses do and um and that's because

837
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:04,139
you know it may not be doing much at low

838
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,539
doses or it may be that it takes a long

839
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:09,179
time to see those effects for example if

840
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:12,239
you eat a healthy diet or you take a

841
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:14,098
certain uh nutritional supplements you

842
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,379
may not see that immediately it may be

843
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,940
down the road where you see benefit and

844
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,420
those are things that are very difficult

845
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:24,420
to to look at and very expensive to look

846
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,400
at in a scientific setting we often talk

847
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,079
about psilocybin on this show and that's

848
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,358
the kind of the idea whole idea behind

849
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,760
micro dosing right is that is that you

850
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,500
just take a little bit every day and so

851
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,820
the materials are there and it's the

852
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,920
it's the constancy over time that uh

853
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,338
allows the for the neurogenesis and

854
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,200
Improvement in in the in the brain

855
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:48,239
um one of the things that always gets me

856
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,819
about CBD though you know where where

857
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,098
I'm asking you about

858
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:55,820
you know the function of CBD so as as

859
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,780
somebody who's looking for longevity

860
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,900
knows

861
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:04,140
um you know what the CBD is like doing

862
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,119
for them it's it it doesn't really

863
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:09,239
discriminate right it kind of gets into

864
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,079
everything and so it's almost like all

865
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,019
right

866
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,560
I can't tell you specifically what CBD

867
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:19,679
is going to do for you and how soon but

868
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:22,199
I can tell you that CBD does so much

869
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,899
good for so many different systems that

870
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,960
you should just take it and and just let

871
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,380
it decide where it's going to work

872
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,139
well when you have multiple

873
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,539
mechanisms multiple ways of of having

874
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:39,000
some sort of benefit

875
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:41,699
you know if there's one area that's not

876
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,039
problematic it may not modulate that

877
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,659
particular system which potentially

878
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:49,019
could give benefit if there's another

879
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:51,659
area where that needs modulation or

880
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:55,139
activity and to your point earlier that

881
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:57,598
I kind of glossed over CBDs relevant to

882
00:36:55,139 --> 00:37:00,000
the endocannabinoid system there's been

883
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,700
a lot of study about it being a negative

884
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,099
alloster modulator meaning like it it

885
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:07,259
can reduce

886
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:10,740
the ability for things like THC to

887
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,500
attach to that receptor there's been

888
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:14,459
some other things like a boost or

889
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,039
endocannabinoids your body's own

890
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,320
cannabinoids I think those are kind of

891
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:22,199
difficult to really understand if that's

892
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,079
really a mechanism but one of the really

893
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,379
interesting uh studies that that I think

894
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:30,720
has just been published was in fragile X

895
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:33,440
which is a type of seizure disorder and

896
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,639
these patients have disruptive

897
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,679
endocannabinoid systems specifically

898
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:42,299
endocannabinoid

899
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:44,699
and it appears that CBD was able to

900
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,339
restore that and it may be because

901
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:50,759
you're not a CBD May prevent the

902
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:53,699
internalization so uh the basically The

903
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:58,140
Disappearance of of these CB1 receptors

904
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:59,939
so think of a uh you know a a tree that

905
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:03,420
gets sucked back down into the dirt

906
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:06,000
right so when the tree is gone then it

907
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,338
doesn't matter you know what type of

908
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,019
molecule you have to stick to that

909
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:13,440
particular receptor there's nothing

910
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:16,259
there to activate so it is possible that

911
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,659
that CBD May prevent some of this

912
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,680
internalization which would be good for

913
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:22,078
uh

914
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,739
an amyloid system as a whole

915
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,660
so I'm sure that we can describe

916
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:30,299
um several different cannabinoids in

917
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:33,239
that similar way where where they can

918
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:36,240
participate uh in in several different

919
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:40,019
ways in several different systems

920
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:43,139
um but but we do know that CBG can have

921
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:47,219
a gerol actually does different things

922
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:50,039
than CBD does so I so next like would

923
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:52,500
you make a delineation

924
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:56,880
um and explain to us what is different

925
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:58,619
about CBG than CBD and and how you have

926
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,500
found it acting or you know what what

927
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:03,180
the state of the science is for CBG

928
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,219
because even though you know most

929
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,838
cannabis enthusiasts are relatively new

930
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,519
to CBG

931
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:10,500
um you know researchers have been

932
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,420
jumping on it as you know the exciting

933
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,440
new novel cannabinoid for a few years

934
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,740
now

935
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,780
mm-hmm yeah I love CBG I think it's a

936
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:21,419
really interesting molecule to study it

937
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,940
is available which some of these other

938
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,240
minor cannabinoids are not available and

939
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,460
it is quite distinct from both THC and

940
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,019
CBD and mechanism

941
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,019
um for your listeners they probably know

942
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:36,179
that you know cbga the acid form is

943
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:40,079
considered the the mother of all

944
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:41,338
cannabinoids it it is after CBG your the

945
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,019
plant that can

946
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:48,299
the cam produces thca or cbda which

947
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,338
which we know very well but it is a

948
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,500
principal component and a lot of

949
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:55,019
available cultivars of cannabis now

950
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,960
which makes it easy for us to or at

951
00:39:55,019 --> 00:40:00,659
least easier for us to study and it's

952
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,679
also not a schedule one compound so Labs

953
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:04,259
don't have to have all these

954
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,960
certifications to examine it so that's

955
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,300
that's step one it's not been available

956
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:14,240
that long so we don't know nearly as

957
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:16,140
much about CBG as we do THC and CBD

958
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,139
primarily we know that they're different

959
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:22,159
and then we do know that there's some

960
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:25,019
unique properties for for CBG around

961
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,358
immune system regulation and around

962
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:30,539
there's something called nucleotide

963
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:33,000
receptors and those are things that are

964
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:35,838
activated on the nucleus of cells so it

965
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,519
may be very important for coding

966
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,920
things that your body produces that are

967
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,920
of benefit or preventing things from

968
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,920
being that are problematic since the

969
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,539
theme for the day is um is Health span

970
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,320
and Longevity will you speak a little

971
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:54,000
bit to cbg's activity on the immune

972
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,700
system

973
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,800
sure well we do see down regulation in

974
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:01,858
in a lot of things that are potentially

975
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,519
problematic like uh tumor necrosis

976
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:09,598
factor and interleukins which can be

977
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:11,780
kind of broadly destructive and are are

978
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,099
common in a lot of disease States

979
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,400
autoimmune related disease states that

980
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:20,579
result in pain and neurodegeneration

981
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Etc so so we do know that it has

982
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:26,640
activity there the interesting thing

983
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,920
will be be to learn does that in

984
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,259
combination with other cannabinoids does

985
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,680
that have a additive or super additive

986
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:37,500
effect that can really help treat some

987
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:39,299
of these diseases and conditions

988
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,219
um for folks who haven't come across

989
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,960
that vocabulary before I'd like you to

990
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:45,059
briefly explain

991
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,220
um uh additive and more specifically

992
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:49,380
super additive because

993
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:51,959
um we continually make the case for

994
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,119
people to consider finding

995
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,280
um either you know whole plant or built

996
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:59,039
cannabis medicines that that have

997
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:02,880
several of these cannabinoids and this

998
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,679
idea of of of of of the the sum being

999
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,780
better being

1000
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:08,639
um more effective than the parts I think

1001
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,200
people I want people to be able to wrap

1002
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,259
their heads around that

1003
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:14,939
sure I and I love the subject

1004
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,740
um I think a lot of people talk about

1005
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,559
the Entourage effect

1006
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:20,879
um it's a very interesting topic and we

1007
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:22,619
do see

1008
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,039
um I like to think of the Entourage

1009
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:28,140
effect is is super additive right and

1010
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,960
what that would mean so let's take a

1011
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:33,719
step back so additive I think of

1012
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,179
additive as very simply as one plus one

1013
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:39,000
equals two right so if you're taking

1014
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:41,699
let's say two medications

1015
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,820
um and one of them reduces your pain by

1016
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:48,000
half or let's say 20 and the other one

1017
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,039
by itself would reduce pain by 20 if you

1018
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,679
take them together and you get a 40

1019
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:55,079
reduction in pain then that would be

1020
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:57,239
additive one plus one equals two which

1021
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:00,720
is benefit right because you may not be

1022
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:02,759
able to to take medication one at a

1023
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,219
higher dose because it may be toxic or

1024
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,160
maybe it just doesn't work Beyond

1025
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:10,379
reducing 20 percent same thing with

1026
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,539
medication too so you have this additive

1027
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,000
effect but sometimes we see these

1028
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:17,699
synergies where we have two different

1029
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,280
medications and you they both reduce

1030
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:22,259
something by 20 but you put them

1031
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,480
together and it's it's forty percent

1032
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,520
reduction you get a eighty percent

1033
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,838
reduction and that's what I would call

1034
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:33,358
Super additive effect and the idea that

1035
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:36,059
um with cannabinoids you may be able to

1036
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:39,119
combine these or they may exist already

1037
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:40,980
in the plant to where by themselves they

1038
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,858
would do nothing or they would help

1039
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,719
somewhat but when combined they do a lot

1040
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:49,679
more and I think that's what the

1041
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:51,598
Entourage effect is defining and it

1042
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,338
could be cannabinoids with other things

1043
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,440
that aren't cannabinoids as well like

1044
00:43:53,338 --> 00:44:01,019
terpenes or flavonoids like cam flavins

1045
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:05,179
we're not really sure but I do think

1046
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:06,800
it's important to outline that

1047
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:09,779
cannabinoids

1048
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,539
specifically sometimes they seem to work

1049
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,519
well together and you get this additive

1050
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:18,000
or super additive effect and sometimes

1051
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:21,358
they don't and we've seen that in with

1052
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,460
CBD and THC and glaucoma we're using

1053
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,219
them to other actually prevents the

1054
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:29,579
benefits or the decrease in the the

1055
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:32,338
pressure in the eye of THC which is

1056
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:34,140
relevant for glaucoma so sometimes it's

1057
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:36,659
great to combine these things but we

1058
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:39,358
need to know what we're combining why

1059
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:41,759
we're combining it and who's it for and

1060
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:44,000
what's the purpose of them taking it and

1061
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,920
then we can probably better understand

1062
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,559
the the potential for having these

1063
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,200
additive or super additive effects great

1064
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:54,719
so I've got one more CBG question before

1065
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:56,460
we go to our first commercial break and

1066
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,879
and that is you know

1067
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,460
um we have been aware of CBD cannabidiol

1068
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,280
for a long time there's now um a a

1069
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,880
substantial and growing body of research

1070
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,280
on it where you know uh you know except

1071
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,700
for in extreme circumstances we're

1072
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,380
pretty confident that CBD is is pretty

1073
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:18,358
much good for everybody we don't really

1074
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,680
have to be concerned about

1075
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:21,719
um taking it

1076
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,779
um and it'll it'll it'll help us or not

1077
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:27,239
but it's it's unlikely to hurt us and

1078
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,819
and we were talking about CBG like uh

1079
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:31,919
we're just learning the benefits and and

1080
00:45:29,818 --> 00:45:34,318
uh certainly anecdotally we know about

1081
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,300
how great it is for things like you know

1082
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:39,420
um anxiety and neuropathy and things

1083
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,400
like that but because we know so much

1084
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:47,760
less about it

1085
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:49,920
um do we know yet that uh CBG is you

1086
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,560
know can be generally regarded as safe

1087
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,838
for everybody uh where where even though

1088
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,239
it hasn't been researched fully yet

1089
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,900
where we're to the point like listen you

1090
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:02,639
know uh we know CBD is going to be safe

1091
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:05,099
cbg's A lot like it we know enough about

1092
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,838
it don't worry about taking it and and

1093
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:08,940
I'll be clear I'll say it for you this

1094
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:11,159
is not medical advice to anybody out

1095
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,838
there who is a who's thinking of it that

1096
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:15,059
way but please Hunter

1097
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,159
yeah thanks thanks for that

1098
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,318
um I don't think we can say it yet you

1099
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,480
know I would like to say it

1100
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:24,900
um I will say that in the work I've done

1101
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,940
both in C elegans and rodents side by

1102
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:30,480
side with CBD

1103
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:34,740
um I found CBG to be better tolerated at

1104
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:38,119
very high doses than than I have CBD so

1105
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:41,338
um and again these are animal models

1106
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:43,440
talks work usually translates fairly

1107
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:45,119
well to humans but not always I mean

1108
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,760
they're I don't know if you remember

1109
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,480
years ago there was this uh this drug

1110
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,660
this company called bile and they were

1111
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,699
making a drug for modulating the

1112
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:59,098
endocannabinoid system it was a thaw

1113
00:46:56,699 --> 00:47:01,439
inhibitor and it looked great in rodents

1114
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:04,500
and then they put it in humans and three

1115
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,300
patients had like brain death wow now I

1116
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,400
don't expect that that is going to

1117
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,560
happen with CVG but you don't you don't

1118
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,440
always know there's and we certainly

1119
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,679
don't know the test you know like the

1120
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,619
the level we haven't tested the level uh

1121
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:22,199
to to where we can go with CBG whereas

1122
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:25,140
like you know there's not really an ld50

1123
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:28,078
a lethal dose that kills 50 percent of

1124
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:30,659
the population with THC no known

1125
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,240
reported deaths other than I think a guy

1126
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:34,379
got smashed by cannabis in his car in a

1127
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:36,799
car accident

1128
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:40,920
um so I guess that might be related but

1129
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:43,079
in C D also seems very safe acutely

1130
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,380
we've given patients like 6 000

1131
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:49,619
milligrams there are concerns with high

1132
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,880
doses and and the impact on liver uh

1133
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:53,160
especially with other drugs like

1134
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,760
valproic acid we haven't done any of

1135
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:59,159
that work with CBG and it's not as well

1136
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:02,220
known in humans like what doses we could

1137
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:03,838
go to so we're not there yet it looks

1138
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:06,659
promising right now though I think it

1139
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:09,420
looks like a very promising molecule in

1140
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:13,440
terms of both safety and efficacy yeah I

1141
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:16,500
agree CBG just has such amazing effects

1142
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,858
specifically for anxiety in the patients

1143
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:22,079
that I've turned on to it and um it's

1144
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:24,358
great where especially when CBD doesn't

1145
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,560
work for them I say have you tried CBG

1146
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:27,598
and then they're like oh wow that

1147
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:29,039
actually worked a lot better for me and

1148
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,599
it's and it's interesting you know

1149
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,500
everybody's you know different and

1150
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,740
that's one of the things I like about

1151
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:37,440
cannabis is individualized medicine

1152
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:39,059
because everybody is a bit different so

1153
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,220
um our next our next cannabinoid we're

1154
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:43,318
going to talk about is THC but let's do

1155
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:44,639
that after the commercial break so we're

1156
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:46,440
going to take a short break and be right

1157
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,539
back you are listening to shaping fire

1158

Hunter land and you know without these

1160
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,719
advertisers shaping fire would not

1161
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:58,519
happen so please support them and let

1162
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,519
them know you heard them on shaping fire

1163
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:02,699
foreign

1164
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,920
cannabis seed Distributors often seem to

1165
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:06,539
be all the same but Multiverse beans

1166

1175
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:27,480
the time from breeders saying some

1176

others

experience you won't get anywhere else

1217
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:59,219
businesses everywhere are striving to

1218
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,140
reach people through advertising we all

1219
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:02,879
know though that trying to reach a

1220
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:05,460
cannabis audience with a quality message

1221
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,380
is pretty difficult that's why many

1222
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:09,300
people choose to advertise on the

1223
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,818
shapingfire podcast

1224
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,740
advertising on this show allows us time

1225
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:16,079
to talk about your product service or

1226
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:18,479
brand in a way that really lets people

1227
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,480
know what sets your company apart from

1228
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,940
others bold people who own companies

1229
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,760
know that getting into relationship with

1230
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:29,519
their customers is essential and that is

1231
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,160
what we offer we will explain your

1232
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:35,039
service or product what sets it apart as

1233
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,078
desirable and help our audience get in

1234
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,539
contact with you it's pretty simple

1235
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,720
really advertising does not have to be

1236
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:45,358
all whiz-bang smoke and mirrors nowadays

1237
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,818
I find that people prefer just to be

1238
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:49,318
spoken to calmly accurately and with

1239
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:50,579
good intentions

1240
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:52,739
if you want to make your own commercial

1241
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:55,619
spot well you can do that too

1242
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:57,598
during these pandemic days conventions

1243
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:00,240
and cannabis events are pretty poorly

1244
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,740
attended but podcast listening is

1245
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:03,419
skyrocketing

1246
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:05,098
with a commercial and shaping fire

1247
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,079
you'll reach your customers in the

1248
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:09,660
privacy of their headphones right now

1249
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:11,880
and will continue to reach new listeners

1250
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:14,578

years

1253
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,838
a spot on shaping fire costs less than a

1254
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:24,300
printed postcard per person and the

1255
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:27,480
shaping fire audience is full of smart

1256
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:29,760
cannabis enthusiasts cultivators and

1257

1264
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,700
one of the challenges with buying

1265
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,559
Autoflower seeds is that often you'll

1266
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:51,960
have as many different phenos as you

1267
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:54,780
will have seeds in a pack that can be

1268
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:57,119
fun sure but so many varieties in one

1269
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,160
pack is a sign of an immature seed line

1270
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,440
that hasn't been worked enough

1271
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:03,358
I prefer my autoflowers to be worked

1272
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,159
enough that each Fino in the pack really

1273
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,480
captures the aspects that the breeder

1274
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:09,358
was intending

1275
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,980
this is why I recommend gnome automatics

1276
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,380
to my friends and listeners who grow

1277
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,539
automatic flowering cannabis seeds

1278
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,400
gnome automatic seeds are not just

1279
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:19,318
crossed and released they are

1280
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,380
painstakingly sifted again and again

1281
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:24,420
tested in a wide range of conditions and

1282
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,180
taken to a level of maturity that each

1283
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:29,519
plant will be recognizable by its trades

1284
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:32,159

talked a lot about our familiarity and

1320
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,099
the substantial body of research we have

1321
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,800
in CBD cannabidiol and then how we have

1322
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:00,599
less research in CBG but we're already

1323
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,579
seeing all of these fantastic results

1324
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:05,220
anecdotally and we're starting to see

1325
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:08,160
them in the lab as well well THC which

1326
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:10,318
is the cannabinoid that most people love

1327
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:11,699
first in cannabis when they get turned

1328
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,940
onto it

1329
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:16,318
um you know it it acts in very uh

1330
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,659
different ways than the other

1331
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,818
cannabinoids most of them that we really

1332
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:23,219
like so so so why don't you start with

1333
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:25,318
that what are we when we're when we're

1334
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:28,558
taking THC

1335
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:30,358
um with it with longevity and wellness

1336
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,599
in mind

1337
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:35,880
um what are the functions of THC that

1338
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,240
were that we're looking to include in in

1339
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,240
the mix

1340
00:55:38,358 --> 00:55:45,299
oh that's a tough one I mean in terms of

1341
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:47,099
longevity there's been we haven't seen

1342
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:50,519
anything that would say that THC is

1343
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:53,519
overtly poor for longevity and we

1344
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:56,099
haven't seen any major problems with

1345
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:58,679
acute toxicity or neurotoxicity at

1346
00:55:56,099 --> 00:56:02,160
relevant Doses and there could certainly

1347
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:04,399
be some some protection I would say it's

1348
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:07,679
just not incredibly clear

1349
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,680
on how specifically that may help with

1350
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:14,399
longevity other than maybe some

1351
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,659
neuroprotection and autoimmune type

1352
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,380
components

1353
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:19,259
um

1354
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:22,380
that's that's essentially where we where

1355
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:24,180
we stand right now so so

1356
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,980
um let's let's hit on that autoimmune

1357
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:27,118
component real quickly because

1358
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:30,119
um you know there are you know

1359
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,220
autoimmune diseases is is at least is

1360
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:36,059
probably becoming way more common but it

1361
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:39,000
is at least becoming uh more commonly

1362
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:43,280
diagnosed and and so what what action

1363
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,280
does THC uh take in that Realm

1364
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,699
well again

1365
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,260
um there's been there have been some

1366
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:52,379
studies especially around like

1367
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:55,920
rheumatoid arthritis and things of that

1368
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,119
nature where we've seen clinical benefit

1369
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,300
um and there have been some studies

1370
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:03,720
pre-clinically that have outlined uh

1371
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:06,240
some benefit around these cytokines so

1372
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:09,239
these compounds that kind of

1373
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:12,838
indiscriminately kill cells but but

1374
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:16,858
again it's it's difficult to make that

1375
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:19,980
broad leap to say that you know THC is

1376
00:57:16,858 --> 00:57:23,279
is certainly going to extend uh lifespan

1377
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:25,800
I think if you have a condition like

1378
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,680
let's say and we don't know this

1379
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,960
scientifically so just to be clear the

1380
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:33,719
FDA hasn't approved THC or THC

1381
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,920
components for anxiety conditions but

1382
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:37,799
let's say

1383
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,500
that as many people do often share that

1384
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:43,200
it helps with anxiety or sleep then then

1385
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,780
by helping those components by helping

1386
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,379
with sleep or or pain sensation or

1387
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:52,619
anxiety you may

1388
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:54,480
indirectly or Downstream effects may may

1389
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:56,818
be that you have improved quality of

1390
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,740
life that you have better activities of

1391
00:57:56,818 --> 00:58:01,259
daily living that you feel better as a

1392
00:57:58,739 --> 00:58:04,259
person and that all feeds into this kind

1393
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:06,540
of Health span category which ultimately

1394
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:09,540
could feed into lifespan

1395
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:11,639
you know I often can uh suggest to

1396
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:17,039
patients who are having inflammatory

1397
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:20,519
issues that doing doing a uh a a CBD

1398
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:23,880
dominant blend with THC so you get the

1399
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:26,699
anti-inflammation properties of both is

1400
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:29,480
a good combination and and for me that

1401
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:34,739
would be the the primary

1402
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:37,199
uh longevity Advantage uh to THC

1403
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:40,379
um are we still seeing that in the in

1404
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:42,539
the research that THC is still you know

1405
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:45,559
considered a beast when it comes to

1406
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:45,558
decreasing inflammation

1407
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:52,440
some models we do see that that THC is

1408
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:55,740
an effective anti-inflammatory we also

1409
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:59,159
see similar effects with CBD and some

1410
00:58:55,739 --> 00:59:01,259
really interesting effects for with cbda

1411
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:03,000
and I don't want to go down a rabbit

1412
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:06,420
hole here but

1413
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,579
um cbda is the acid version that

1414
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,798
happened that that occurs naturally in

1415
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:14,700
the plant before we heat it and I think

1416
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:17,239
both thca again the acid version in the

1417
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:20,159
plant before it's heated or what we call

1418
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:21,779
decarboxylated seem to be really

1419
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,159
important for those inflammatory

1420
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:25,619
responses

1421
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:29,159
I think with uh the conversation that

1422
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:30,780
that we're having about THC and how

1423
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:32,818
um you know the the different things

1424
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,619
that it can do at different levels this

1425
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:37,558
would be a really good time for us to

1426
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:39,780
address uh the biphasic nature of

1427
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:43,140
cannabinoids because I I think that it

1428
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:45,839
is most obvious to most early users when

1429
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:48,058
it comes to THC so will you review that

1430
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:50,639
for us

1431
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:52,260
oh yes I I think I'm so glad you brought

1432
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:55,139
it up because I think this is probably

1433
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:58,579
one of the more critical uh components

1434
00:59:55,139 --> 01:00:01,379
of being able to use especially use THC

1435
00:59:58,579 --> 01:00:04,798
for its position potential to treat

1436
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:07,079
disease so you know I think if you look

1437
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:09,798
at the literature and you look at

1438
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:13,980
self-reports a lot of patients will say

1439
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:15,780
THC at lower doses help my anxiety we

1440
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,900
know it's approved for increasing

1441
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,819
appetite and multiple indications we

1442
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:23,940
know that it helps with nausea I think

1443
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:27,358
those are clear but what's also clear is

1444
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:31,318
this biphasic effect where as you go up

1445
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:33,598
then you lose those properties and in

1446
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:36,900
fact you induce the opposite so low

1447
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:39,838
levels anti-anxiety high levels massive

1448
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:43,798
paranoia low levels increase appetite

1449
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:47,578
reduce nausea high levels vomiting and

1450
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:50,818
nausea the spins Etc so there is this

1451
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:53,220
therapeutic window that I think is an is

1452
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:56,099
incredibly important and this isn't you

1453
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:59,399
know just unique to cannabis and THC

1454
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:00,599
it's also common and like Robitussin for

1455
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,000
example

1456
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:05,280
um it could be effective for for as an

1457
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,159
expectorant to help you breathe while

1458
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,960
you're if you have a cold uh maybe with

1459
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:11,879
cough and congestion but if you drink

1460
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,338
the bottle you're probably going to

1461
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,960
hallucinate right so there's this

1462
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:19,440
therapeutic window and I think that's

1463
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:23,338
where THC sits the difficult thing

1464
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:26,900
around THC is we mentioned it earlier is

1465
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:31,139
this endocannabinoid tone so you've got

1466
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:32,579
two things in in patients that are are a

1467
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:36,539
little bit confounding when you're doing

1468
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:38,940
cannabis research one of those is how

1469
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:40,798
many CB1 receptors do they have and

1470
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:43,200
where are they because that's why

1471
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:45,239
certain people can take high doses of

1472
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,159
cannabis and they're fine and then other

1473
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:48,959
people will take it and they'll have a

1474
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:51,539
lot of problems right

1475
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,139
be very prone to anxiety and that's

1476
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:57,599
probably based on the dose and then

1477
01:01:55,139 --> 01:02:00,659
secondly is if you're consuming it

1478
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:03,480
orally metabolism and I'm not speaking

1479
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:06,539
like metabolism like how fit are you I'm

1480
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,219
talking about these compounds that are

1481
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:10,380
in your liver as well as elsewhere but

1482
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:14,219
primarily in your liver they're called

1483
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:18,420
cytochrome p450s or or sip enzymes for

1484
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:21,838
short and they break down uh a lot of

1485
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:24,619
plant derived molecules and um and these

1486
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:28,679
and what the result is is

1487
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:31,858
the components the outcome so to speak

1488
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:34,558
of of how much exposure it gets to your

1489
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:37,558
brain so certain people just can't break

1490
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:40,380
down THC very well and they get very

1491
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:42,298
very high levels and other people are

1492
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,780
rapid metabolizers and they break it

1493
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:48,000
down really quickly so we have to juggle

1494
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:50,280
these two things in research and there's

1495
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,079
no way of looking at somebody and saying

1496
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,119
oh you're going to break this down

1497
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:57,780
really quickly so I need to give you a

1498
01:02:54,119 --> 01:03:00,900
higher dose or you have more CB1

1499
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:04,380
receptors on your Pathways that result

1500
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:07,380
in anxiety so we need to be more careful

1501
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,539
wow there's so much in what you just

1502
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,798
said let's see all right so going back a

1503
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:13,739
little ways

1504
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:15,719
um uh uh I I I will say this and you do

1505
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:17,159
not have to comment on it but it has

1506
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:19,379
been a long time since I've thought

1507
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:20,759
about Robo tripping uh you know you

1508
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,519
talked about drinking the whole bottle

1509
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:26,339
of Robitussin and back when I was a a

1510
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:28,318
you know young freelance

1511
01:03:26,338 --> 01:03:31,078
um

1512
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:32,099
pharmacist if you will in college

1513
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:34,079
um you know you know it was something

1514
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:35,220
that we heard you could do and so and so

1515
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,539
you know you got to get the right kind

1516
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:38,519
and all this kind of stuff and so we

1517
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:40,798
tried it and it's it's it's it's really

1518
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:41,759
unpleasant for for your gut and

1519
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:43,318
everything

1520
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,480
um but oh gosh

1521
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:47,579
um yeah so I I haven't thought about

1522
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,838
that in 25 years so so that's

1523
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:51,900
interesting

1524
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:52,639
um uh the the second thing is is um you

1525
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:56,639
know

1526
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:59,279
when we're talking about each person is

1527
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,779
going to have their own I don't know

1528
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,780
what you'd call it but a biphasic

1529
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:08,040
threshold for THC I think that's another

1530
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:09,780
good reason why when people start to use

1531
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:12,539
um cannabis medicine for the first time

1532
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:15,660
that includes THC that you always start

1533
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:17,818
low and slow because you may be

1534
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:21,598
particularly sensitive you may not be

1535
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:25,079
but but it's better to start slow and

1536
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:27,780
and work your way up based on an actual

1537
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:29,400
plan of the results you want instead of

1538
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:32,220
just assuming you're going to be fine

1539
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,900
and starting high and then having to pay

1540
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:37,139
the piper because

1541
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:39,358
um you know when when THC goes from you

1542
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:41,940
know jolly good and relaxing to oh my

1543
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,739
God I'm I'm freaking out and do I need

1544
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:45,480
to call paramedics which you don't but

1545
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:47,879
you might you definitely think you might

1546
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,019
like that that is a really bad day at

1547
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,140
the office

1548
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:54,480
it is bad it is you know THC induced

1549
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:57,598
psychosis is pretty scary I've I've

1550
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,358
witnessed some high-dose THC studies the

1551
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:02,640
FDA in in some cases

1552
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:04,619
um wants you to do high-dose studies to

1553
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,358
figure out where this threshold is and

1554
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:09,059
it can be quite scary and when we did

1555
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:12,659
some of that work with satavex patients

1556
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:15,960
had to be sedated so remember earlier

1557
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:19,259
when we were talking about Gaba uh the

1558
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,019
the benzo like effect being cut off by

1559
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,220
CB1 receptors

1560
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:26,519
that's one of the reasons that you get

1561
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:29,759
this anxiety so one of the treatments to

1562
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:32,519
prevent that is to give benzos and

1563
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,680
that's often what can happen in hospital

1564
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:38,099
settings when patients get this massive

1565
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:40,679
paranoia so it is it is scary

1566
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:43,318
um with for those of you who don't know

1567
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:47,338
what side of X is it's a it's a

1568
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:50,659
basically a 50 50 blend of a two

1569
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:53,279
different plants high THC and CBD plant

1570
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:55,399
that was used in clinical trials and a

1571
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,740
lot of the research that we have around

1572
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:02,099
cannabinoids is based on that particular

1573
01:05:58,739 --> 01:06:04,679
medicine that's approved you know in

1574
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:08,099
about 28 countries but not in the U.S

1575
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:10,679
and when that they did those trials as

1576
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:14,039
they continue to learn about it they had

1577
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:16,199
a self-titration built in to the

1578
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:20,539
clinical trials and this is something I

1579
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:23,098
worked on uh in a good bit of depth and

1580
01:06:20,539 --> 01:06:25,920
you know we would see patients kind of

1581
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:27,960
all over the map some would have six

1582
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,880
administrations a day and some would

1583
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,579
have 12. and you can never look at them

1584
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:35,400
and tell and we asked them to balance

1585
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:37,079
the safety and efficacy so to go up to

1586
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,000
the point where they felt like it was

1587
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:41,220
helping and they weren't getting bad

1588
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
side effects and and I think that's a

1589
01:06:41,219 --> 01:06:46,379
good rule of thumb if you're using THC

1590
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,199
actually going to the point where you're

1591
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:50,940
intoxicated may be negative there's some

1592
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:54,298
evidence that when you get really high

1593
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:56,760
you increase sensation to pain and

1594
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:58,619
increased sensation to to feeling in

1595
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,079
general I mean you know if you go back

1596
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:04,140
to the 60s when a lot of cannabis was

1597
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:06,240
being used at you know music festivals I

1598
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:09,659
I don't know that they were doing it to

1599
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:12,419
decrease sensation and and it may be

1600
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:15,298
that that lower doses are better for

1601
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:17,940
treating pain than intoxicating doses

1602
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:19,199
so I want to take a sidebar because you

1603
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,838
mentioned a topic that I'm very

1604
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:25,699
interested in and that it's very hard to

1605
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:28,980
find information on and that is a rapid

1606
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:31,500
metabolizers so so I only learned about

1607
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:34,798
rapid metabolizers you know about about

1608
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:37,739
four years ago or so and um and it

1609
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:39,538
explains a lot and and so I I want to

1610
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:42,000
set it up in a certain way and then I'd

1611
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:45,420
just like you to speak to it because you

1612
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,699
know in cannabis it is it is very common

1613
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:50,700
for people to have

1614
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:53,818
um dumb internet arguments about dosage

1615
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:56,098
right and and you know you know Dr Russo

1616
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:59,338
is is talking about you know Optimum

1617
01:07:56,099 --> 01:08:02,099
doses for THC you know you know well

1618
01:07:59,338 --> 01:08:04,679
under well under 20 for nearly everybody

1619
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:06,599
and whereas other times you're you're

1620
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:09,899
you're you're you're you know I'll watch

1621
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:12,480
somebody eat a 200 milligram edible of

1622
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:14,940
THC and I'm like how in the hell is that

1623
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,520
even possible and okay if somebody is a

1624
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:20,460
long-term chronic pain patient certainly

1625
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,440
tolerance can be made up over time but

1626
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,659
sometimes these people are like newbies

1627
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:27,599
and and they're just eating that and and

1628
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:29,519
it doesn't seem to phase them and and I

1629
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,400
didn't really understand that there were

1630
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:35,279
these rapid metabolizer people until I

1631
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:37,259
met a whole family of them and

1632
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,120
um it was interesting I was

1633
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:42,420
um you know aware of their cannabis

1634
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:43,979
usage and and the doses that they were

1635
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:46,079
telling me that they were taking for

1636
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:47,399
their various issues

1637
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:49,500
um were like as far as I was concerned

1638
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:51,539
they were off the charts like they were

1639
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:55,140
they were really high they were you know

1640
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:57,060
to you know to to to to relax after work

1641
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:59,819
you know somebody who was relatively new

1642
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:02,460
was was taking you know 80 milligrams of

1643
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:05,100
of THC and RSO and I'm like you've got

1644
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:07,198
to be kidding me I'd be I'd be crying at

1645
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,940
80 milligrams let alone without my

1646
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:10,439
tolerance that I've got from years of

1647
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:13,858
use right

1648
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:16,139
um and then uh I was at a a music event

1649
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:19,440
on the island with one of the people in

1650
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:22,079
this family and I watched them eat five

1651
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:24,960
grams of mushrooms for their first time

1652
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:27,359
and um and and it and it didn't affect

1653
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:30,420
them and and they're like oh I'm a rapid

1654
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,460
metabolizer you know it it just my body

1655
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:35,759
just like metabolizes everything like I

1656
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:38,279
can't have any fun and I'm like man hey

1657
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,798
you're lucky because taking a heroic

1658
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:43,020
dose like that without knowing it your

1659
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:45,960
first time could be also be a really bad

1660
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:47,759
day so so it's weird because rapid

1661
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:50,219
metabolizers

1662
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:53,880
um they explain a lot of these kind of

1663
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:56,340
Black Swan events that that as somebody

1664
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,260
who is trying to support people to learn

1665
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:00,300
about you know cannabis medicine

1666
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:03,480
specifically but you know the wider

1667
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:06,900
field of entheogens as well these people

1668
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:10,859
like they they their biology Breaks the

1669
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:13,679
Rules so would you just speak to the I

1670
01:10:10,859 --> 01:10:15,359
don't know the metabolics of of of rapid

1671
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:19,020
metabolizers

1672
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:21,899
sure you know it's it's fairly common

1673
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:23,840
that a proportion in these trials will

1674
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:27,238
have rapid

1675
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:30,179
metabolizers and there's actually a test

1676
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:33,178
that we can do so it's about 450 dollars

1677
01:10:30,179 --> 01:10:36,480
and you can be tested to find out which

1678
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:39,359
enzyme so the enzymes are the components

1679
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:41,639
that break down these plant compounds as

1680
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:43,619
well as other compounds like drugs in

1681
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:48,000
the liver and you can look and you can

1682
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:51,420
say oh wow I have a really elevated or

1683
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,859
I'm most likely to metabolize drugs that

1684
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:58,859
are through the 3a4 pathways so sip 3a4

1685
01:10:55,859 --> 01:11:01,259
or 2c19 there are a bunch of these

1686
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:04,619
different enzymes and they could say

1687
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:06,900
pretty definitively say you know if you

1688
01:11:04,619 --> 01:11:09,000
take these drugs you're going to have to

1689
01:11:06,899 --> 01:11:10,979
take higher levels or they're not going

1690
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,359
to work because as soon as they get to

1691
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:15,959
your liver they're going to be broken

1692
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:18,599
down immediately so that that does

1693
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:21,500
happen and you can also have the the

1694
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:24,060
opposite effect where a lot of patients

1695
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:27,420
will will break them down very slowly

1696
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:30,300
and they have to go with ultra low doses

1697
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:34,079
to avoid you know toxicity and side

1698
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:37,679
effects the other interesting component

1699
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:40,859
here too is that that kind of levels

1700
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:44,579
goes on with this is the is the food

1701
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:46,679
effects so you know Administration in

1702
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:48,539
let's say a gummy could be very

1703
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:52,319
different than Administration with fat

1704
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:54,479
we know that with THC if it's taken with

1705
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:58,380
with a high fat meal you increase

1706
01:11:54,479 --> 01:12:00,419
exposure three to five fold so that

1707
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:02,400
brings on another level you know you've

1708
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,679
got this endocannabinoid tone then

1709
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:07,920
you've got you know how quickly or

1710
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:10,260
slowly are they metabolizing THC or

1711
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:13,199
other cannabinoids and then did they

1712
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:15,000
take it with food because then we've

1713
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:17,099
increased the levels

1714
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,198
um that wouldn't normally be there if

1715
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,239
you took it on an empty stomach so it

1716
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:23,579
gets pretty complicated yeah it really

1717
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:26,158
does and and again this is Another good

1718
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:28,198
argument for one size fits all just

1719
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:30,119
because your friend is taking this other

1720
01:12:28,198 --> 01:12:32,519
particular blend of cannabinoids and

1721
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:34,760
it's working for them doesn't mean that

1722
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,860
specific blend is going to work for you

1723
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:39,980
and we really need to you know start

1724
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:42,119
with the basics and build up your

1725
01:12:39,979 --> 01:12:45,839
endocannabinoid you know medicine

1726
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:47,698
exposure over time and also why I you

1727
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:51,480
know recommend that patients always keep

1728
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:53,099
a uh a a dosing journal for any any

1729
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:55,859
entheogens

1730
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:57,900
um just so you remember what worked for

1731
01:12:55,859 --> 01:12:59,279
you and and what didn't especially what

1732
01:12:57,899 --> 01:13:01,738
didn't

1733
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:04,198
right and I would just I would say in

1734
01:13:01,738 --> 01:13:06,059
that journal they should also take note

1735
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:08,339
of if it's something that they're

1736
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:09,960
consuming rather than smoking they

1737
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,699
should probably take note of what they

1738
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:14,640
had to eat and

1739
01:13:11,698 --> 01:13:17,399
what the format was because you know if

1740
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:20,760
you take it it could be so minor as in

1741
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:22,619
if you take it with MCT oil medium chain

1742
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,600
triglycerides which is what a lot of

1743
01:13:22,619 --> 01:13:27,300
these products come in versus something

1744
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,780
like Sesame or corn oil or hemp seed oil

1745
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:33,179
the exposure is way different the the

1746
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:36,238
MCT oil kind of carries it great

1747
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:39,600
directly to the liver and some of these

1748
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:42,000
other fats can can push some of it into

1749
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,100
the lymphatic system so it gets into the

1750
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,779
bloodstream but without going to the

1751
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:51,480
liver first to get broken down so again

1752
01:13:47,779 --> 01:13:53,340
it's I wish it was simple but it's it's

1753
01:13:51,479 --> 01:13:54,479
not that's really interesting I hadn't

1754
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,020
heard that about

1755
01:13:54,479 --> 01:14:00,299
um Sesame oils being able to push it

1756
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:02,159
into the system bypassing the liver I'm

1757
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,199
gonna have to look into that yes some a

1758
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:06,779
proportion of it and and this is kind of

1759
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:09,839
the same technology if you hear like

1760
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:13,198
seds like self-emulsifying drug Delivery

1761
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:15,779
Systems or like some of these that are

1762
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:18,419
that are used in beverages or fast

1763
01:14:15,779 --> 01:14:21,119
acting uh most of it's not proven but

1764
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:23,219
there are some data available that that

1765
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:25,019
show that some of this technology can

1766
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:27,119
push it quickly into the lymphatic

1767
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:30,480
system and you don't have to wait for it

1768
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:32,579
to get broken down by the liver and um

1769
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:36,359
and there's higher levels in your blood

1770
01:14:32,579 --> 01:14:39,238
earlier great so all right so uh let's

1771
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:42,420
move on to the next cannabinoid uh and

1772
01:14:39,238 --> 01:14:45,238
and since we already did CBD CBG and THC

1773
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:48,000
which are our most readily available for

1774
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:51,738
you know regular folks I'm going to

1775
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,719
create a basket of the rest of of the

1776
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:57,000
cannabinoids you know one that I know

1777
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:59,100
you've done a lot of research in is uh

1778
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,920
canned Flavin but also there's there's

1779
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:03,420
all these other

1780
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:05,100
phytocannabinoids that that

1781
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:06,658
um either we won't have the time to talk

1782
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,940
about today or there isn't even any

1783
01:15:06,658 --> 01:15:11,579
research on them so I would like you to

1784
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:16,519
generally speak to them as this for

1785
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:19,619
people people who prefer whole plant

1786
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,659
resin preparations like you know what we

1787
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:24,539
call many people call RSO Rick Simpson

1788
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:26,819
Oil but like a whole a whole um a whole

1789
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:28,760
resin extract like that

1790
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:32,099
um how should we wrap our heads around

1791
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:35,460
these these um these trace and novel

1792
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:37,199
cannabinoids that will like all also be

1793
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,239
in there right they're not going to be

1794
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:42,059
mentioned on the label they're probably

1795
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:44,819
not going to be tested for but uh but

1796
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:46,739
most many of us who are fans of whole

1797
01:15:44,819 --> 01:15:48,960
plant medicine we like them in there

1798
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:51,718
because of a of a belief that they hold

1799
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,600
a synergistic quality maybe some kind of

1800
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:58,020
protectant nature from having a bad

1801
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:59,760
experience and an assumption that

1802
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,920
they're probably good for us in ways

1803
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,360
that we don't know but like there's a

1804
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,819
lot of assumptions in what I just said

1805
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:08,880
and so and so you know

1806
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:09,479
with the goal of trying to

1807
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,359
um

1808
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:14,519
speak to how these extra components play

1809
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:15,899
a role in longevity for people who are

1810
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,420
going to be designing their own

1811
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:20,099
supplementation system what do you have

1812
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:22,800
to say about these these kind of like

1813
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,179
variables that we can't control but

1814
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,739
we're just assuming they're gonna be

1815
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:28,440
okay

1816
01:16:25,738 --> 01:16:30,718
yeah I think it's I think it's difficult

1817
01:16:28,439 --> 01:16:33,238
um because it's to some degree it's a

1818
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:35,460
little bit of a mystery soup and I would

1819
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:37,379
say that mystery soup could be very

1820
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,859
important we know that some of the

1821
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:43,980
cannabinoids um there there's one called

1822
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:46,500
thcp uh that's in in very small amounts

1823
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:49,738
in certain plants but it's a very potent

1824
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:52,640
CB1 Agonist at low levels

1825
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:55,619
um so that may be of critical compo

1826
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,659
importance uh to some of the these

1827
01:16:55,619 --> 01:16:59,399
Botanical extracts

1828
01:16:57,658 --> 01:17:01,920
um but but having it there are not

1829
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:05,039
having it there could ultimately make a

1830
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,719
tremendous difference I would say if you

1831
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:09,600
found something that's a chemical

1832
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:13,079
extract that you like and that worked

1833
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,940
for you then I wouldn't you know trying

1834
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:17,039
to to get something different you may

1835
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:19,019
have a very different effect this could

1836
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,119
be down to the terpenes it could be down

1837
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:24,480
to these minor cannabinoids

1838
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:26,698
um canned flavins could be of critical

1839
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:29,639
importance around inflammatory processes

1840
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:32,879
so without knowing what that is it's

1841
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:35,100
difficult to say Hey you know this group

1842
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,960
of other things this other mystery soup

1843
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:40,560
is going to help where it's going to

1844
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:43,380
hurt and and you could as I mentioned

1845
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,620
earlier that that that those mystery

1846
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:48,480
molecules could be the Holy Grail to

1847
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:51,658
treating a disease or they could be

1848
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:54,000
counteracting one another and we see

1849
01:17:51,658 --> 01:17:57,119
this with terpenes and cannabinoids so

1850
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,340
without having it better characterized

1851
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:02,219
it's it's really tough it's really tough

1852
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:05,760
to say because they're also unique you

1853
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:07,619
know yes it's a tough one so to wrap up

1854
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,679
this particular topic before we move on

1855
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:12,658
I want to talk uh briefly about

1856
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:15,179
um uh endocannabinoid deficiency

1857
01:18:12,658 --> 01:18:17,279
syndrome um our mutual friend Dr Ethan

1858
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:18,600
Russo has been on shaping fire several

1859
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:20,399
times

1860
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,960
um uh talking about endocannabinoid

1861
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:25,019
deficiency syndrome as it relates to

1862
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:26,939
different research that he has done and

1863
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:28,920
um it's it's interesting that you know

1864
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:31,319
one of the reasons we want to supplement

1865
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:33,899
our body with these phytocannabinoids

1866
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:36,960
that we are sourcing from the cannabis

1867
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:39,479
plant is because our own body is not

1868
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,698
producing the endocannabinoids the

1869
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:46,198
endogenous cannabinoids that are made

1870
01:18:41,698 --> 01:18:48,238
inside of the body properly and so you

1871
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:49,919
know the the causes for endocannabinoid

1872
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:54,419
deficiency include you know poor

1873
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:57,060
nutrition poor sleep anxiety and immune

1874
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:58,859
suppressing Pharmaceuticals and uh you

1875
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,880
know environmental toxins you know a

1876
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,979
whole bunch of things that are just

1877
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,840
generally not good for our human and we

1878
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:06,839
get that right

1879
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,300
um but I'm of the opinion that the vast

1880
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:11,159
majority of Americans are are probably

1881
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:14,100
suffering from endocannabinoid

1882
01:19:11,158 --> 01:19:15,599
deficiency syndrome from the beginning

1883
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,280
um and so you know I personally think

1884
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,159
everybody should be taking some kind of

1885
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:22,139
of supplementation to strengthen it

1886
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:23,399
um would you speak to

1887
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:25,440
um I I don't know if you can speak to

1888
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:28,319
the commonness of endocannabinoid

1889
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,539
deficiency but would you speak to um the

1890
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:34,079
idea of endocannabinoid deficiency as it

1891
01:19:30,539 --> 01:19:36,380
relates to you know longevity and and

1892
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:39,359
how you know being deficient in

1893
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:43,020
endocannabinoids will degrade probably

1894
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:45,539
both your length of life and your your

1895
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:48,179
health span of life

1896
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:50,519
oh that's a that's a good one

1897
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:53,640
um I think it's again it's difficult to

1898
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:56,280
say uh definitively I think we can both

1899
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:59,340
agree and and just about everybody will

1900
01:19:56,279 --> 01:20:02,460
agree that the endocannabinoid system is

1901
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:04,319
critical to health and uh can play a

1902
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:06,719
major component in a variety of

1903
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:08,479
different diseases the the interesting

1904
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:11,760
thing about

1905
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:14,639
endocannabinoids is they they're they're

1906
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,860
made on demand and they're metabolized

1907
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:20,159
very quickly especially most of them

1908
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:22,019
inside the brain right and we can't it'd

1909
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:23,879
be great if we could just test you like

1910
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:27,020
a regular blood test and draw some blood

1911
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:30,480
and say oh you're anandamide

1912
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:32,880
right make everything so much easier it

1913
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:35,639
would make it so easy but unfortunately

1914
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,739
the levels in your blood and how quickly

1915
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:39,060
they change based on stress and

1916
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:41,698
environment

1917
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:44,640
um it they don't match what happens in

1918
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:48,000
the brain so if you have endocannabinoid

1919
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:50,159
deficiency room so to speak that affects

1920
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,560
that's important because remember these

1921
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:55,619
cannabinoid receptors are also in the

1922
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,860
periphery so it's not just anxiety and

1923
01:20:55,619 --> 01:21:01,260
mood it could be joint pain it could be

1924
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:04,019
um inflammatory bowel disease something

1925
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:06,360
completely unrelated to what's going on

1926
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:10,380
the CNS then then maybe you could

1927
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:12,359
examine this and get some idea of of you

1928
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:16,560
know a dosing regiment that would help

1929
01:21:12,359 --> 01:21:19,799
that but for CNS Related Disorders you

1930
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,719
can't really look at it so I would agree

1931
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:25,020
with you that it's the endocannabinoid

1932
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:27,679
system or dysregulation may be a

1933
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:31,860
critical component to a lot of diseases

1934
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:33,960
is it the cause or is it a symptom I

1935
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:36,179
think is still very difficult to

1936
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,158
determine but we do know that it does

1937
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:39,539
happen and is associated with many

1938
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:41,879
different diseases

1939
01:21:39,539 --> 01:21:45,179
all right so the next thing I want to

1940
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:48,060
talk about is um how functional ratios

1941
01:21:45,179 --> 01:21:50,640
between the different cannabinoids how

1942
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:53,640
that plays a role in your overall health

1943
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:55,980
span because you know you know the

1944
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:59,820
underlying idea that that I'm suggesting

1945
01:21:55,979 --> 01:22:01,979
that that that folks find a blend of

1946
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:04,319
cannabinoids that work for them and then

1947
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:07,559
take it you know as a daily supplement

1948
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:09,899
to keep their endocannabinoid

1949
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,760
um strong or their endocannabinoid

1950
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:15,899
system strong

1951
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:19,079
um how much of each really does uh play

1952
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:20,579
a role and and you know I've gone in and

1953
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:22,920
out of

1954
01:22:20,579 --> 01:22:25,679
being behind functional ratios when I

1955
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:28,440
was when I was all new to this you know

1956
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:30,779
I was I was very into the okay do we

1957
01:22:28,439 --> 01:22:33,779
want a 20 to 1 ratio or is that a two to

1958
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:36,119
one ratio of CBD to THC and and you know

1959
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:38,759
you know this ratio is for Parkinson's

1960
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:41,760
and this ratios and and I realized over

1961
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:44,300
time that those might be good places to

1962
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:47,640
start but really

1963
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:52,020
every person has got their own

1964
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:55,800
functional ratio I think and so

1965
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:58,980
um would you explain how you approach uh

1966
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:01,140
thinking about ratios uh from a you know

1967
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:05,519
a longevity and wellness

1968
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:08,100
um perspective as a research scientist

1969
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,800
well in terms of longevity and wellness

1970
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:13,980
we don't know a lot I mean the the best

1971
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:17,640
the most recent work is one of the kind

1972
01:23:13,979 --> 01:23:20,039
of first examinations around c elegans

1973
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:22,739
um looking at isolated compounds versus

1974
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:26,479
like this Botanical drug substance that

1975
01:23:22,738 --> 01:23:29,879
contained CBD and CBG and THC together

1976
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:31,799
in combination but um you know is that

1977
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,900
the ideal ratio what happens when you

1978
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:37,140
change that how does that translate to

1979
01:23:33,899 --> 01:23:40,198
humans I think it's still in the early

1980
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:43,079
stages in terms of functional race

1981
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:45,599
ratios and how they potentially could

1982
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:47,719
treat disease I think that's a little

1983
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,940
bit more clear-cut

1984
01:23:47,719 --> 01:23:52,920
especially in when not to use certain

1985
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:56,579
things or when to keep certain things

1986
01:23:52,920 --> 01:24:00,719
low like THC in way where it may be

1987
01:23:56,579 --> 01:24:04,019
better to have higher amounts of THC or

1988
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:06,060
or a smaller ratio with THC and CBD I

1989
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:09,780
think that's that's a little bit more

1990
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:11,520
clear again to do this research with so

1991
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:13,198
many different humans who are all

1992
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,600
different with so many different

1993
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:18,379
diseases and so many different variables

1994
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:22,500
is tough and it's it's almost

1995
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:24,840
like you know it's a case-by-case basis

1996
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:27,300
as you mentioned you you said you kind

1997
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:30,539
of have like certain ratios that you

1998
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:32,460
think are ideal for certain diseases but

1999
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:35,840
that may only be the the starting point

2000
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:38,520
they may be able to be further optimized

2001
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,560
or on the contrary there might be

2002
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:42,840
certain conditions where you don't need

2003
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:46,679
to optimize them very much at all it may

2004
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,600
just be that it works at that level

2005
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:51,658
of that disease state

2006
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:54,480
you know uh this this next thought is

2007
01:24:51,658 --> 01:24:58,198
for folks who are you know so far down

2008
01:24:54,479 --> 01:25:00,599
the path with this that they are they're

2009
01:24:58,198 --> 01:25:02,519
producing their own medicine because you

2010
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,739
know as as we see when when the rubber

2011
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:08,219
hits the road when somebody is sick

2012
01:25:04,738 --> 01:25:10,799
enough and Western medicine has not been

2013
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:12,658
the solution for them and they find

2014
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:15,480
their way to cannabis and they find

2015
01:25:12,658 --> 01:25:17,698
something that works it's a very short

2016
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:20,579
path from oh my gosh this works a little

2017
01:25:17,698 --> 01:25:23,099
bit to suddenly they're you know growing

2018
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:25,500
their own plants that are the types of

2019
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:28,739
plants that they want and then they're

2020
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:30,840
processing it using you know ethanol and

2021
01:25:28,738 --> 01:25:33,359
they are making their own Custom Blends

2022
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:36,300
that work for their particular body

2023
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:39,059
right and um it's it's been great you

2024
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:40,980
know over the last say five years with

2025
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:44,400
um the Advent of some of these uh

2026
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:48,178
spectacular hemp varieties that you know

2027
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:52,979
will isolate one uh cannabinoid like you

2028
01:25:48,179 --> 01:25:55,380
know the the all CBD hemp plant that you

2029
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:58,198
know comes from Oregon CBDs or the or

2030
01:25:55,380 --> 01:26:00,539
the all CBG version you know so so you

2031
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:04,019
can you can grow these plants and and

2032
01:26:00,539 --> 01:26:06,420
and make one uh make a CBG oil and make

2033
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:09,540
a CBD oil and then make your type one

2034
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:11,699
plant your THC oil you know make three

2035
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:14,460
different oils and then and then blend

2036
01:26:11,698 --> 01:26:17,000
them like a Vintner would like you know

2037
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:19,500
blending a red table wine or something

2038
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,079
and and you know that's what I had to do

2039
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:25,079
after my brain injury to find something

2040
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:27,539
that was going to be a low enough amount

2041
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:29,460
of THC that I could

2042
01:26:27,539 --> 01:26:31,679
um you know take it during the day and

2043
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:35,279
still be functioning at my best level

2044
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:37,739
but then also high levels of CBD I

2045
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:40,079
wanted for for the neurogenesis and the

2046
01:26:37,738 --> 01:26:42,479
Brain support and then and then then

2047
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:46,079
when when it became available the CBG

2048
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:48,479
plants because they keep my central

2049
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:51,300
nervous system from running too hot

2050
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:54,839
which which happens to me because of

2051
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:56,639
other diagnoses so so this idea of hand

2052
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,940
blending them

2053
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:02,940
um I I think is a real is a real winner

2054
01:26:59,939 --> 01:27:05,460
um so so I guess my my my I guess I just

2055
01:27:02,939 --> 01:27:07,979
would like to hear your thoughts on the

2056
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:11,639
gap between

2057
01:27:07,979 --> 01:27:14,879
um What patients need how patients

2058
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:17,880
become citizen scientists and how so

2059
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:22,020
many patients go to the the licensed

2060
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:24,480
market for their first medicine and and

2061
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:27,420
it doesn't work for them like it has

2062
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:31,738
worked for other people

2063
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:34,380
I I'm on board with the idea of blending

2064
01:27:31,738 --> 01:27:38,218
to a certain specification from multiple

2065
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:41,119
different plants so you know there is a

2066
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:45,480
limit to what can be produced in an

2067
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:47,639
idyllic ratio from Plants I mean it's

2068
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:49,619
nice to think I mean a lot of people

2069
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:51,900
think oh you know this plant that's here

2070
01:27:49,619 --> 01:27:53,579
it's on Earth it's for us it's the cures

2071
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:56,460
it's to heal us

2072
01:27:53,579 --> 01:27:59,460
um and that's that's fine but

2073
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:02,279
um plants aren't actually here so we can

2074
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:03,719
eat them predominantly because of you

2075
01:28:02,279 --> 01:28:05,719
know a lot of these are defense

2076
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:09,060
mechanisms

2077
01:28:05,719 --> 01:28:11,698
they're not they're not bred in a such a

2078
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:13,560
way that that if we that they were so

2079
01:28:11,698 --> 01:28:15,839
magic that they would just be gone at

2080
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:18,120
least historically now obviously we grow

2081
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,980
them and breed them for recreational use

2082
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:23,519
or medicinal use and that's that's

2083
01:28:19,979 --> 01:28:25,619
helped but I I don't think that we'll be

2084
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,900
able to just say oh this is the perfect

2085
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:30,479
plant and the perfect ratio and it will

2086
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:32,339
stay at that perfect ratio I think to

2087
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:35,218
your point of saying hey let's have

2088
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:39,119
multiple different extracts in blend

2089
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:41,819
them to a ratio of Active Components

2090
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:43,859
that we know help at this ratio is

2091
01:28:41,819 --> 01:28:46,198
probably a much better approach than

2092
01:28:43,859 --> 01:28:49,920
just saying you know some arbitrary

2093
01:28:46,198 --> 01:28:51,779
named cannabis cultivar is the best for

2094
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,420
treating this disease and and

2095
01:28:51,779 --> 01:28:57,119
unfortunately I think we've seen this in

2096
01:28:54,420 --> 01:29:00,000
dispensaries in many cases where you

2097
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:02,639
know Grandma goes in and she said oh you

2098
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:06,000
know I've got pain what should I use and

2099
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:09,600
somebody gives her you know AK-47 or you

2100
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,219
know whatever and uh that's not they

2101
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,739
didn't tell her about dosing they didn't

2102
01:29:11,219 --> 01:29:15,600
tell her about Ratio or or anything like

2103
01:29:13,738 --> 01:29:17,759
that she has a bad experience and her

2104
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,739
thought is I've tried medicinal cannabis

2105
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:23,039
it didn't work it doesn't work and it

2106
01:29:19,738 --> 01:29:25,919
made me sick you know or you know they

2107
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:27,899
take somebody says oh you know CBD is

2108
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,960
good for it may help my epilepsy and

2109
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:32,339
they take 25 milligram gummy and it

2110
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,859
doesn't do anything and they're like oh

2111
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:38,460
I've tried CBD for seizures and it and

2112
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:40,259
work so I think you're kind of on the

2113
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:42,899
right track and more on the scientific

2114
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:45,739
track and the others are kind of more on

2115
01:29:42,899 --> 01:29:48,198
The Branding and

2116
01:29:45,738 --> 01:29:51,539
kind of

2117
01:29:48,198 --> 01:29:53,219
optimistic idea that something magical

2118
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:55,198
is going to happen

2119
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:57,658
so I want to finish off this set with a

2120
01:29:55,198 --> 01:29:59,879
conversation that um you know I know

2121
01:29:57,658 --> 01:30:01,399
you're really well versed in and I spend

2122
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,960
a lot of time thinking about and and

2123
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:06,719
because I keep an open mind about it my

2124
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:09,600
opinion has definitely uh changed over

2125
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:11,399
the last you know decade

2126
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:15,900
um of of working with cannabis medicine

2127
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:19,619
and it is the idea of a whole plant

2128
01:30:15,899 --> 01:30:21,238
medicine versus using isolate and and

2129
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:23,519
this is this is how I want I'm gonna set

2130
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:26,099
you up is that you know uh because

2131
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:29,340
because you know Dr Ethan Russo has been

2132
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:31,800
my mentor from the very beginning and um

2133
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,179
he has historically

2134
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:37,020
um you know

2135
01:30:33,179 --> 01:30:38,940
I dare say ferociously whole plant and

2136
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:40,620
um and you know I learned that from him

2137
01:30:38,939 --> 01:30:42,359
and then

2138
01:30:40,619 --> 01:30:44,639
um and for those who aren't familiar

2139
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:46,859
whole plant means that um you're you're

2140
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:49,020
you're you're using a method to extract

2141
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:51,719
all of the resin from the plant and then

2142
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:53,580
you are uh you know taking that resin

2143
01:30:51,719 --> 01:30:57,719
orally

2144
01:30:53,579 --> 01:31:00,719
um and then you know nowadays when there

2145
01:30:57,719 --> 01:31:05,039
are so many more labs and people are are

2146
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:08,460
uh you know separating uh the resin from

2147
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:12,600
the plant and then continuing to extract

2148
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:15,600
the single molecules of say CBD or CBG

2149
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:18,120
from the resin and then and then either

2150
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:21,060
you know selling that as a as a as a

2151
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:23,099
powder or taking you know that powder

2152
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:25,020
and putting into a gummy or or or

2153
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:26,760
whatever it is

2154
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:28,440
um and then and then at the at the

2155
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,840
extreme what is going to become much

2156
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:33,119
more common is pharmaceutical products

2157
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:37,380
where uh different components of the

2158
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:39,840
resin are isolated and then combined and

2159
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:42,060
you know I've I've gone so far when I've

2160
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,699
when I've been talking at conventions to

2161
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:46,980
call this like you know

2162
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:48,719
Frankenstein built like preparations and

2163
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:51,119
and you know I'm not quite that hot

2164
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:54,239
about you know it as much as I used to

2165
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:56,519
be but there but we do know that isolate

2166
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:59,579
acts different than whole plant medicine

2167
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:02,340
it is it you know there's a um there's a

2168
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:04,619
plateau point where where Moore doesn't

2169
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:07,139
uh help anymore

2170
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:09,059
um and and many believe that it acts

2171
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:12,239
differently because it's not necessarily

2172
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:14,580
working in a synergistic uh way with the

2173
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:18,059
rest of the novel and minor cannabinoids

2174
01:32:14,579 --> 01:32:21,238
that are in the resin and yet there is

2175
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:23,039
absolutely good use for it the first one

2176
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:25,859
for me that I had to come around to and

2177
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:28,800
embrace isolate was when CBD became

2178
01:32:25,859 --> 01:32:31,380
popular but before the CBD plants were

2179
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:34,980
everywhere and so and so people were

2180
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:38,819
like we want to take CBD in our you know

2181
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:42,419
cannabis oil but there's no CBD in the

2182
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:45,000
plants that we have near us and so you

2183
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:47,399
know we decided to start

2184
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,460
um you know spiking a type one plant

2185
01:32:47,399 --> 01:32:53,099
like a THC plant we we started you know

2186
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:55,500
like like talking about spiking those

2187
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:59,280
preparations with a CBD isolate because

2188
01:32:55,500 --> 01:33:01,619
CBD isolate was available before

2189
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:04,079
um CBD plants were in a lot of places

2190
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:05,579
let alone CBD plants that don't have THC

2191
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:08,279
that are going to mess with your ratio

2192
01:33:05,579 --> 01:33:09,779
right and so you know I I first went to

2193
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:12,179
Ethan about it and he's all like yeah

2194
01:33:09,779 --> 01:33:13,500
until you can get the plant you know you

2195
01:33:12,179 --> 01:33:14,100
can Spike with

2196
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,079
um

2197
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:18,000
with the powder and you know we talked

2198
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,460
to Dr Sunil Agarwal and he's all like

2199
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,679
yeah you know until you well well damn

2200
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:24,899
because that suddenly I was I was

2201
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:27,480
interested in isolate and recommending

2202
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:29,939
it that that patients use it for this

2203
01:33:27,479 --> 01:33:34,500
particular purpose now with that big

2204
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:37,819
setup I know that uh you know you and I

2205
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:42,500
have discussed the challenge between

2206
01:33:37,819 --> 01:33:45,899
balancing the kind of you know ideal

2207
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:49,139
nature won't hurt me any nature can heal

2208
01:33:45,899 --> 01:33:52,259
me kind of like Beauty you know ideal

2209
01:33:49,139 --> 01:33:55,319
plant medicine headspace that I really

2210
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:58,079
grasp onto with with the more more

2211
01:33:55,319 --> 01:34:01,500
realistic idea or or differently

2212
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:04,619
realistic idea that good cannabis

2213
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:08,279
medicine is the same every time gives

2214
01:34:04,619 --> 01:34:11,279
repeatable results and hits the goals of

2215
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:14,519
the patient and you know I gotta say

2216
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:17,579
that there's so many variables in in

2217
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:20,520
making your own cannabis medicine that

2218
01:34:17,579 --> 01:34:23,039
that very often we won't hit those goals

2219
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,600
and so in so you know breaking it apart

2220
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:27,060
and putting it back together by hand

2221
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:28,800
like a pharmaceutical company would or

2222
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:31,139
like you have to do in the lab for your

2223
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,480
studies that makes a lot of sense as far

2224
01:34:31,139 --> 01:34:35,760
as control goes but then it also makes

2225
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:38,519
me cringe because I really do think

2226
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:40,860
there is some kind of like known X

2227
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:43,679
variable of healing that comes with

2228
01:34:40,859 --> 01:34:45,000
whole plant so so I know that's this is

2229
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:47,520
also probably another topic that you

2230
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,260
could do a whole show on on her but um

2231
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,659
but but I know there's a lot of people

2232
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:55,500
out there who are making their own

2233
01:34:51,658 --> 01:34:58,138
medicine who really chew on this and and

2234
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:00,779
I'd like to hear your thoughts

2235
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:02,819
sure I think it's an interesting topic

2236
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:03,859
and and like you said it could be a long

2237
01:35:02,819 --> 01:35:06,179
topic

2238
01:35:03,859 --> 01:35:08,279
there are a couple components first I

2239
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:11,819
would say that if you're looking at

2240
01:35:08,279 --> 01:35:14,340
isolated compounds quite frankly you

2241
01:35:11,819 --> 01:35:16,979
should be careful about what the

2242
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:18,659
excipients are and those those compounds

2243
01:35:16,979 --> 01:35:20,759
and I think this kind of goes without

2244
01:35:18,658 --> 01:35:22,799
saying for most of your audience but

2245
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:25,560
when you when you're making an isolate

2246
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,300
and this isn't the case with every

2247
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:28,500
isolate maker there's a lot are you

2248
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,940
gonna are you gonna just are you gonna

2249
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:31,920
Define what an excipient is are you

2250
01:35:29,939 --> 01:35:34,439
going to get there oh yes I'm going to

2251
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,300
get there all right but uh yes so in

2252
01:35:34,439 --> 01:35:39,599
excipient I'll just go

2253
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:43,619
go for it now right and the excipient is

2254
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:47,219
um the a component that is not

2255
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:50,760
um what is in that particular ingredient

2256
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:51,658
so an excipient like adulterers in the

2257
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,940
isolate

2258
01:35:51,658 --> 01:35:56,519
yeah you could call them adulterants but

2259
01:35:53,939 --> 01:35:58,919
they're used specifically for the

2260
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:01,980
extraction and crystallization process

2261
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:04,139
for so one Method Of crystallization to

2262
01:36:01,979 --> 01:36:07,198
make it into a white powder out of a

2263
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:10,500
resin is to add things like heptane or

2264
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:13,379
pentane and you can and you can clean

2265
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:16,380
those up right but depending on who's

2266
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:19,500
making it you could have some of these

2267
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:21,300
nasty solvents in there so it's not it's

2268
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,859
not the isolate that would necessarily

2269
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:25,139
be the problem but it could be the

2270
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:27,479
provider so I would say if people are

2271
01:36:25,139 --> 01:36:30,779
using those it would be important to get

2272
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:33,599
a COA that shows things like metals and

2273
01:36:30,779 --> 01:36:35,639
everything else but also what solvents

2274
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,860
are present in that isolate and that's

2275
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:39,600
where you know if there aren't

2276
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:42,119
regulations in place to make sure the

2277
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:45,120
stuff's clean that taking solvents over

2278
01:36:42,119 --> 01:36:48,779
and over again like naphthala or paint

2279
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:52,559
thinner or butane residual butane could

2280
01:36:48,779 --> 01:36:54,238
be problematic so just something to keep

2281
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:57,739
in mind when you're using those

2282
01:36:54,238 --> 01:37:00,959
compounds to fortify existing uh

2283
01:36:57,738 --> 01:37:03,299
formulations the other thing just to

2284
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:05,698
point out on the isolates versus the

2285
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:07,739
non-isolates is I think there are

2286
01:37:05,698 --> 01:37:10,138
certain conditions where

2287
01:37:07,738 --> 01:37:12,899
you know to get the Entourage or this

2288
01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:16,800
rational polypharmacy uh kind of effect

2289
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:18,719
may not be needed in in an example uh

2290
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,159
would be in some cases of pediatric

2291
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:23,939
epilepsy

2292
01:37:20,158 --> 01:37:28,079
um I don't think the jury's out on how

2293
01:37:23,939 --> 01:37:31,619
much THC is is good or bad for children

2294
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:34,920
um and and on of the uh the group that

2295
01:37:31,619 --> 01:37:37,319
would say until we know if we can avoid

2296
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,060
it and get the result we want that may

2297
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:43,079
be beneficial I think there's a lot more

2298
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:46,500
safety data on CBD for kids so if um if

2299
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:49,319
I can give a child CBD in an isolated

2300
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:51,539
form and then be seizure free and not

2301
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:54,960
have side effects then I don't I don't

2302
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:56,819
see a good reason to say let's add a

2303
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,158
bunch of other stuff in there if they're

2304
01:37:56,819 --> 01:38:01,198
already basically if the treatment is

2305
01:37:59,158 --> 01:38:03,899
successful unfortunately that doesn't

2306
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:06,059
happen all the time it actually is quite

2307
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:08,339
infrequent that that happens and that's

2308
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:10,620
where you'll need to to

2309
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:13,380
you know this whole plant extract can

2310
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:16,019
these other cannabinoids play a critical

2311
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:17,880
role to reducing seizures or help treat

2312
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:21,659
disease and and what are those

2313
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:24,719
components um so uh it may be that that

2314
01:38:21,658 --> 01:38:27,359
fortifying existing whole plant extracts

2315
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:29,880
with other isolated compounds is the

2316
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:32,339
best way to get what you call

2317
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:36,480
Frankenstein medicine but I would say

2318
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:39,679
maybe optimized medication that may be

2319
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:39,678
the only way to get there

2320
01:38:39,779 --> 01:38:44,579
it's probably a very similar to the

2321
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:47,158
argument you just made but for for those

2322
01:38:44,579 --> 01:38:50,158
of us who really idealize whole plant

2323
01:38:47,158 --> 01:38:52,579
medicine would you make the case

2324
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:55,500
to me as a whole plant medicine

2325
01:38:52,579 --> 01:38:58,319
Aficionado on

2326
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:59,698
why I should be open to the kinds of

2327
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:03,139
formulations that are presently

2328
01:38:59,698 --> 01:39:06,419
happening at pharmaceutical companies

2329
01:39:03,139 --> 01:39:08,760
do you mean isolated compounds or yeah

2330
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:10,319
like like you know you know we can take

2331
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,300
you know epidiolex or side effects or

2332
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:14,340
any of these where where

2333
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:17,460
um you know they have taken multiple

2334
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:21,360
components of cannabis resin and then

2335
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:24,480
they have put together those exclusively

2336
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:28,079
so so it's it's not the entire melange

2337
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:30,599
of resin but they have taken the parts

2338
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:33,300
that they think are most essential

2339
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:38,579
to getting the desired results for the

2340
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:41,579
patient and but it's not whole plant but

2341
01:39:38,579 --> 01:39:44,158
there are reasons for it so I you know

2342
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:46,500
as somebody who like you have a foot in

2343
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:51,559
both camps right you believe in both and

2344
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:53,639
so so for me who is still resistant to

2345
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:55,980
uh you know the pharmaceutical

2346
01:39:53,639 --> 01:39:57,960
preparations

2347
01:39:55,979 --> 01:39:59,759
um I I would like to hear what you what

2348
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:01,920
what you what you would say to somebody

2349
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:03,780
like me because so that all of us who

2350
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,960
think like me can learn

2351
01:40:03,779 --> 01:40:09,238
so you know I would say well satavex is

2352
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:12,139
a whole plant medicine it's it's

2353
01:40:09,238 --> 01:40:14,339
literally an extract of two different

2354
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:18,060
cultivars of cannabis and Blended

2355
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:19,400
together so you have a idyllic ratio or

2356
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:22,139
at least what they thought was an

2357
01:40:19,399 --> 01:40:25,259
idealistic ratio when they invented it

2358
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:28,980
now the the other components the the

2359
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:32,520
excipient so what that cannabis is in

2360
01:40:28,979 --> 01:40:34,439
um isn't necessarily the same as what is

2361
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:37,020
commonly available

2362
01:40:34,439 --> 01:40:39,899
um in in dispensaries right so they use

2363
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:43,080
other kind of pharmaceutical components

2364
01:40:39,899 --> 01:40:45,539
that that may or may not be important so

2365
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:49,198
to speak for for delivery now epidiolex

2366
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:51,719
is is CBD isolate and sesame oil with

2367
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:53,399
strawberry flavoring and a little bit of

2368
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:55,260
ethanol to dissolve that strawberry

2369
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:58,679
flavoring and that's that's primarily

2370
01:40:55,260 --> 01:41:02,880
done so you know these kids that are

2371
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:06,119
um you know very sick and off often they

2372
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:08,039
have like autistic like features or not

2373
01:41:06,119 --> 01:41:10,920
all of them obviously but oftentimes

2374
01:41:08,039 --> 01:41:13,079
that's what happens in these cognitively

2375
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:14,699
delayed children and if it doesn't taste

2376
01:41:13,079 --> 01:41:17,939
good then they're not going to take it

2377
01:41:14,698 --> 01:41:19,279
right so you know I think in these

2378
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:23,460
instances

2379
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:25,859
having you know a pharmaceutical that is

2380
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:29,760
prescribed by a physician that's covered

2381
01:41:25,859 --> 01:41:31,698
by insurance that works is is a great

2382
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:34,860
step in the right direction

2383
01:41:31,698 --> 01:41:37,618
we know that the doses that you need for

2384
01:41:34,859 --> 01:41:40,859
CBD to control seizures are usually

2385
01:41:37,618 --> 01:41:42,960
quite high so from the hundreds to even

2386
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:45,479
thousands of milligrams needed to

2387
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,520
control seizures if you were a patient

2388
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:49,559
it's almost like

2389
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,420
um it's almost like dangling a carrot

2390
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,460
you know it's like hey we have this

2391
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:55,260
treatment it may help you or it may help

2392
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:57,779
your child but you're going to have to

2393
01:41:55,260 --> 01:42:00,380
spend a hundred dollars a day or fifty

2394
01:41:57,779 --> 01:42:03,719
dollars a day to buy it off the shelf

2395
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:05,940
then it becomes unattainable so how

2396
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:09,480
having a system whether it's a whole

2397
01:42:05,939 --> 01:42:11,519
plan you know a whole plant extract that

2398
01:42:09,479 --> 01:42:14,819
goes and meets FDA requirements for

2399
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:18,600
being the same thing standardized that's

2400
01:42:14,819 --> 01:42:21,539
proven to work in a disease accepted by

2401
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:23,520
physicians and scientists and you know

2402
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:26,460
whether you're from the deep south and

2403
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,739
think cannabis is evil or whether you're

2404
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:31,020
a cannabis connoisseur where you're like

2405
01:42:28,738 --> 01:42:34,079
hey we've got data that works and it's

2406
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:38,580
safe and it's covered by payers and

2407
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:41,399
insurance is a really good situation for

2408
01:42:38,579 --> 01:42:43,439
patients until we fix all the other

2409
01:42:41,399 --> 01:42:46,500
stuff and that could be for an isolate

2410
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:49,019
or it could be for a whole plant extract

2411
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:52,198
that we just know is the same and

2412
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:54,840
because we've proven it worked it gets

2413
01:42:52,198 --> 01:42:57,899
reimbursed from from insurance

2414
01:42:54,840 --> 01:43:00,060
I think that's a really good uh way to

2415
01:42:57,899 --> 01:43:01,399
ground that argument hunter that that in

2416
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:04,260
the end

2417
01:43:01,399 --> 01:43:06,299
what is our end goal our end goal is not

2418
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:07,860
whole plant medicine our end goal is to

2419
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:12,179
reduce the suffering of our fellow

2420
01:43:07,859 --> 01:43:14,099
humans and if and if we can get there in

2421
01:43:12,179 --> 01:43:17,940
a way that is safe for their physical

2422
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:20,100
body and also relieves their symptoms

2423
01:43:17,939 --> 01:43:22,439
um whether or not it's whole plant or

2424
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:25,380
it's whole plant spiked with isolate or

2425
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:28,198
it is a you know pharmaceutical blend

2426
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:30,239
that was put in a lab like they're all

2427
01:43:28,198 --> 01:43:32,219
hopefully getting us to the goal which

2428
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:33,419
is to reduce suffering and that's the

2429
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:35,639
point

2430
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:36,719
yeah I couldn't agree more and and

2431
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:39,359
you're just

2432
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:41,158
your audience most of your audience I

2433
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:42,719
would expect that that most of you guys

2434
01:43:41,158 --> 01:43:44,939
out there listening

2435
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,079
um are not anti-cannabis but there are

2436
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:48,419
people

2437
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:50,219
um that are completely anti-cannabis and

2438
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:52,319
there are people that are maybe on the

2439
01:43:50,219 --> 01:43:54,899
fence but they're just not going to a

2440
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:56,639
dispensary they're not you know and a

2441
01:43:54,899 --> 01:44:00,238
lot of doctors are not going to

2442
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:03,840
prescribe grandma or Grandpa you know

2443
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:05,819
um purple kush or you know name any of

2444
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,920
one of these these different uh

2445
01:44:05,819 --> 01:44:10,439
cultivars of cannabis they're just not

2446
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:13,199
going to do it so if you we want to help

2447
01:44:10,439 --> 01:44:16,259
that subset of people whether they're

2448
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:19,559
right or wrong in their opinions having

2449
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:21,659
a cannabis extract a whole plant

2450
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:23,580
medicine or an isolate that can help

2451
01:44:21,658 --> 01:44:25,460
reduce their suffering that would be

2452
01:44:23,579 --> 01:44:29,039
prescribed by a physician

2453
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:31,439
has a much higher chance of success than

2454
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:33,719
trying to convince them to talk to their

2455
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:36,118
budtender or grow their own cannabis and

2456
01:44:33,719 --> 01:44:37,380
make their own medicine it's just it's

2457
01:44:36,118 --> 01:44:39,599
not going to happen

2458
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:40,980
yeah right on well said all right well

2459
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,659
this this set has gone a little long

2460
01:44:40,979 --> 01:44:44,459
this is a great conversation um but

2461
01:44:42,658 --> 01:44:46,379
let's go ahead and take a break and then

2462
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:48,420
when we come back we're going to have a

2463
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:50,219
a nice short set where we're talking

2464
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:51,840
about a couple of the things to be

2465
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:53,399
careful for

2466
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,800
um when taking

2467
01:44:53,399 --> 01:44:58,138
um cannabis uh to increase your

2468
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,360
longevity and health span

2469
01:44:58,139 --> 01:45:02,219
um you are listening to shaping fire and

2470
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:04,579
my guest today is neuroscientist Hunter

2471
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:04,579
land

2472
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,580
you've heard me talk about the

2473
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:10,560
award-winning cannabis seeds that come

2474
01:45:08,579 --> 01:45:12,359
from the analytical breeding program of

2475
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:15,539
Seth and Eric Crawford who founded

2476
01:45:12,359 --> 01:45:18,118
Oregon's CBD seeds in fact Seth was a

2477
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:21,000
guest on shaping fire in 2020 to talk

2478
01:45:18,118 --> 01:45:23,579
about triploid genetics Seth and Eric

2479
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,979
are now releasing high THC seeds for

2480
01:45:23,579 --> 01:45:30,000
home Growers and Farms as grow the

2481
01:45:25,979 --> 01:45:32,939
revolution seeds at GTR seeds.com

2482
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,579
their high THC seeds are extraordinary

2483
01:45:32,939 --> 01:45:37,919
in that they will start to flower at 16

2484
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:39,899
and a half hours of daylight instead of

2485
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:43,020
the typical 14 and a half hours of

2486
01:45:39,899 --> 01:45:45,000
daylight that means in most regions your

2487
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:47,280
plants will start to flower outdoors in

2488
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,800
the middle of July instead of the middle

2489
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:52,019
of August which means these photo period

2490
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:54,539
plants finish in September and not

2491

flowering CBG line and bred it to some

Hunter land so here we are with the big

2588
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:34,319
finish you know Hunter I wanted to talk

2589
01:49:32,219 --> 01:49:37,020
about a couple of things that folks

2590
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:39,658
should be careful of

2591
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:42,300
um when designing their uh

2592
01:49:39,658 --> 01:49:45,179
supplementation regime to increase their

2593
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:46,739
their lifelong wellness and health span

2594
01:49:45,179 --> 01:49:49,020
because

2595
01:49:46,738 --> 01:49:51,779
um because you know people do put other

2596
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:54,840
things in their body as well and and

2597
01:49:51,779 --> 01:49:57,658
nothing in the body uh you know exists

2598
01:49:54,840 --> 01:50:01,079
in a vacuum and so you know we recently

2599
01:49:57,658 --> 01:50:05,179
did a a full-length show with uh uh uh

2600
01:50:01,079 --> 01:50:08,340
Jahan Marcou about interaction between

2601
01:50:05,179 --> 01:50:10,260
cannabis and other Pharmaceuticals but I

2602
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:12,659
I think it deserves to be brought up

2603
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:15,600
here as well since we're talking about

2604
01:50:12,658 --> 01:50:17,219
you know wellness and people you know

2605
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:19,260
developing a supplemental routine that

2606
01:50:17,219 --> 01:50:20,880
they use every day

2607
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:23,280
um because there is a very you know

2608
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:26,340
there it's very possible maybe even

2609
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:29,579
likely that there will be interactions

2610
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:32,100
between the Cannabis regimen that that

2611
01:50:29,579 --> 01:50:35,219
they come up with for themselves and

2612
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:37,380
other things that they are taking and um

2613
01:50:35,219 --> 01:50:40,079
so I would like you to speak to the idea

2614
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:41,819
of of cannabis you know drug drug

2615
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:43,559
interaction

2616
01:50:41,819 --> 01:50:45,539
um so people can understand the lay of

2617
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:47,159
the land as they are thinking this

2618
01:50:45,539 --> 01:50:49,139
through on how they're going to proceed

2619
01:50:47,158 --> 01:50:52,138
please

2620
01:50:49,139 --> 01:50:55,319
sure yeah I think it's a very important

2621
01:50:52,139 --> 01:50:59,219
point I'd like listeners to keep in mind

2622
01:50:55,319 --> 01:51:01,380
that you know the reason that we have a

2623
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:04,380
lot of these enzymes in our liver and we

2624
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:06,420
have our liver to process uh compounds

2625
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:09,300
that we're exposed to and many of those

2626
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:11,940
are plant compounds and the way that

2627
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:13,800
these enzymes work is when they're

2628
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:15,500
exposed to the compound it breaks it

2629
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:18,840
down to something

2630
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:21,600
not active or usually inactive that's

2631
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:25,920
easily excreted by the body

2632
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:28,739
there's a lot of overlap on what each

2633
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:31,739
enzyme breaks down whether it's a

2634
01:51:28,738 --> 01:51:34,019
medicine or a drug a plant a nutritional

2635
01:51:31,738 --> 01:51:36,178
matter the body doesn't know whether

2636
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:39,000
it's artificial or if it's real it just

2637
01:51:36,179 --> 01:51:41,760
it sees something that it needs to get

2638
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,399
out of the body or at least it thinks

2639
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,480
and I'm

2640
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:48,779
personalizing the liver now which is a

2641
01:51:45,479 --> 01:51:50,939
little bit odd for a scientist but um so

2642
01:51:48,779 --> 01:51:53,340
it doesn't really you don't really see

2643
01:51:50,939 --> 01:51:54,779
this distinction between natural and

2644
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:56,279
synthetic as far as the liver is

2645
01:51:54,779 --> 01:51:58,439
concerned it just knows it needs to

2646
01:51:56,279 --> 01:52:01,618
excrete these compounds the problem

2647
01:51:58,439 --> 01:52:05,279
comes when you only have X amount of

2648
01:52:01,618 --> 01:52:07,979
enzyme to break down one drug and an or

2649
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:10,639
one compound and you also need that

2650
01:52:07,979 --> 01:52:14,039
enzyme to to break down another compound

2651
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:16,500
and that's one example of where you can

2652
01:52:14,039 --> 01:52:20,000
get elevations and we see this a lot

2653
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:23,158
with CBD especially at higher doses so

2654
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,920
for example there's a drug called

2655
01:52:23,158 --> 01:52:29,339
clopazam that's commonly prescribed in

2656
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:32,520
LGS and Dravet to Pediatric

2657
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:35,880
really sad forms of epilepsy

2658
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:38,580
and what happens is if you take CBD in

2659
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:42,420
conjunction with clopazam both the drug

2660
01:52:38,579 --> 01:52:46,019
clopazam goes up as well as the active

2661
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:48,960
metabolite seven hydroxycvd which also

2662
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:51,780
works both of those go up

2663
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:52,939
um when when clopazam goes up it causes

2664
01:52:51,779 --> 01:52:55,800
sedation

2665
01:52:52,939 --> 01:52:59,099
and we saw this in clinical trials and

2666
01:52:55,800 --> 01:53:02,340
the patients needed to reduce oftentimes

2667
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:04,679
reduced either CBD or clopazam after the

2668
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:07,500
trial and clinical practice to limit

2669
01:53:04,679 --> 01:53:10,139
this this potential drug drug

2670
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:12,719
interaction there's also interactions

2671
01:53:10,139 --> 01:53:15,300
around potential interactions around

2672
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:18,480
bleeds for things like Warfarin which is

2673
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:21,960
a commonly prescribed drug for for

2674
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:25,618
people with clotting that need to reduce

2675
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:28,560
clotting factors and probably the most

2676
01:53:25,618 --> 01:53:32,519
concerning thing that we saw in all the

2677
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:35,940
CBD Research is risk for liver toxicity

2678
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:39,000
so we didn't really see any per se liver

2679
01:53:35,939 --> 01:53:41,579
toxicity but we did see indicators in

2680
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,219
blood work that said hey this might not

2681
01:53:41,579 --> 01:53:46,859
be good for the liver at this dose and

2682
01:53:44,219 --> 01:53:49,198
that was commonly in really high doses

2683
01:53:46,859 --> 01:53:52,019
and it was also common when they were

2684
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:54,539
taking another drug called Depakote

2685
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:56,280
which is a known liver Toxin and these

2686
01:53:54,539 --> 01:53:59,060
are the ones we know about they're

2687
01:53:56,279 --> 01:54:03,658
probably you know five to ten other

2688
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:06,179
drugs that may have this interaction

2689
01:54:03,658 --> 01:54:08,460
with CBD where it may not be a good

2690
01:54:06,179 --> 01:54:11,039
thing and that the same thing can be

2691
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:13,618
said for some of these supplements

2692
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:15,420
um you know there's a lot of supplements

2693
01:54:13,618 --> 01:54:17,460
that combine a lot of different plant

2694
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:21,179
components and some of these can be

2695
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:23,100
enzyme Inhibitors so exhibit inhibiting

2696
01:54:21,179 --> 01:54:26,039
the the components that break down the

2697
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:28,739
drugs or they can also induce them

2698
01:54:26,039 --> 01:54:30,420
basically tell your body oh we don't

2699
01:54:28,738 --> 01:54:33,000
have enough of this so we're going to

2700
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:34,800
increase these levels and then then

2701
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,500
you're not going to get the the the

2702
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:40,199
quality or the amount of exposure needed

2703
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:43,020
to treat your disease so these can be a

2704
01:54:40,198 --> 01:54:45,960
tough little Balancing Act if you're

2705
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:48,360
doing it on your own so it's always good

2706
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:50,340
to consult with a pharmacist or a

2707
01:54:48,359 --> 01:54:51,779
physician about these potential drug

2708
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:54,239
drug interactions

2709
01:54:51,779 --> 01:54:56,399
and for considering the state of the

2710
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:58,618
technology and everything right now you

2711
01:54:56,399 --> 01:55:01,019
know for for the common person probably

2712
01:54:58,618 --> 01:55:02,880
the place to start would be to Google

2713
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:04,800
your

2714
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:07,199
um your pharmaceutical that you're

2715
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:09,119
taking and the word cannabis and start

2716
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:10,738
there right because like that's that's

2717
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:12,420
pretty much gonna be your entry to any

2718
01:55:10,738 --> 01:55:14,698
of this kind of data and then and then

2719
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:16,679
follow up with whatever studies you come

2720
01:55:14,698 --> 01:55:19,439
across if there are any

2721
01:55:16,679 --> 01:55:21,179
sure yeah that would be one way you

2722
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:23,698
could definitely do that again cannabis

2723
01:55:21,179 --> 01:55:25,920
you know if you look up if you've got uh

2724
01:55:23,698 --> 01:55:27,539
just a little bit of CBD in your

2725
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:29,760
cannabis that's probably not going to be

2726
01:55:27,539 --> 01:55:33,000
the same as if you're taking like you

2727
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:35,760
mentioned a high CBD chemovor of hemp

2728
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:38,399
right so so dose is definitely a

2729
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:40,560
critical component to these I think it's

2730
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:43,019
a reasonable place to start

2731
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:45,360
um the other thing would be

2732
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:47,940
um you know to the pharmacists actually

2733
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:50,759
are pretty pretty knowledgeable in this

2734
01:55:47,939 --> 01:55:52,279
area and the other type of drug drug

2735
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:54,300
interaction that we see is

2736
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:56,939
pharmacodynamic interactions and what

2737
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:58,679
that means is like how does it it might

2738
01:55:56,939 --> 01:56:02,399
not be the molecules themselves

2739
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:04,139
interacting but it may be that kind of

2740
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:06,420
like you're having the Entourage effect

2741
01:56:04,139 --> 01:56:08,940
to treat disease you might have uh

2742
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:10,920
Entourage effect for inebriation or

2743
01:56:08,939 --> 01:56:13,618
sleep or something like that whereas

2744
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:15,960
like if you take if you drink alcohol

2745
01:56:13,618 --> 01:56:18,979
with cannabis you know they're not

2746
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:21,600
necessarily inner acting directly but

2747
01:56:18,979 --> 01:56:23,759
they may have a pharmacodynamic

2748
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:26,219
interaction like then if you didn't want

2749
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,780
to drive the car with your you know x

2750
01:56:26,219 --> 01:56:29,639
amount of drinks you might definitely

2751
01:56:27,779 --> 01:56:32,519
not want to drive the car with that plus

2752
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:35,460
cannabis so those are things and that

2753
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:37,760
happens with other medications too like

2754
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:40,618
commonly deprived prescribed

2755
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:42,840
antidepressants or or a lot of these

2756
01:56:40,618 --> 01:56:45,599
drugs that are mood stabilizers and

2757
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:47,880
things that are for sleep so you might

2758
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:52,260
get these other interactions especially

2759
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:54,060
with THC the pharmacodynamic ones I've

2760
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:55,199
got one more safety question and then

2761
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:57,480
we'll wrap up

2762
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:58,738
um you know we've been talking about a

2763
01:56:57,479 --> 01:57:01,259
lot of different

2764
01:56:58,738 --> 01:57:02,419
um dosages and some of them are quite

2765
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:05,760
high

2766
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:07,319
for people who are developing their own

2767
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:10,920
regimen

2768
01:57:07,319 --> 01:57:12,658
um is there a too high a dose then that

2769
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:14,219
can actually hurt like you know as as

2770
01:57:12,658 --> 01:57:16,439
many of people have said it's like oh

2771
01:57:14,219 --> 01:57:18,239
even water can kill you if you take

2772
01:57:16,439 --> 01:57:19,678
enough of it so we do know that there's

2773
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:21,718
like a maximum for pretty much

2774
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:24,060
everything but

2775
01:57:21,719 --> 01:57:27,300
um you know how can how can somebody

2776
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:30,480
who's formulating for the first time

2777
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:32,900
think about the how much is too much

2778
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:32,899
question

2779
01:57:32,939 --> 01:57:38,219
yeah well I think you know we've seen I

2780
01:57:36,359 --> 01:57:41,039
mean cannabis generally is pretty safe

2781
01:57:38,219 --> 01:57:43,679
but you also see cannabis hyperemesis

2782
01:57:41,039 --> 01:57:46,319
syndrome some so some individuals

2783
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:49,079
um just end up for whatever reason over

2784
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:52,198
time not being able to tolerate THC very

2785
01:57:49,079 --> 01:57:54,420
well so there is that component that it

2786
01:57:52,198 --> 01:57:56,638
could change what is safe at the

2787
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:57,679
beginning may not be safe months or

2788
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:01,319
years later

2789
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:04,560
and secondly you know I I think it would

2790
01:58:01,319 --> 01:58:08,099
be a reasonable idea if you're taking

2791
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:11,060
um CBD you know in in hundreds of

2792
01:58:08,099 --> 01:58:14,340
milligrams types doses

2793
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:17,219
looking at your kind of standard liver

2794
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:19,500
panel your standard liver enzymes as

2795
01:58:17,219 --> 01:58:21,840
part of your physical exam I think could

2796
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:24,359
be important because you can always see

2797
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:27,119
these elevations or maybe you already

2798
01:58:24,359 --> 01:58:30,118
have these elevations and then piling

2799
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:34,380
CBD on top of that may be maybe a risk

2800
01:58:30,118 --> 01:58:36,000
so I think it's it's um it would be in

2801
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:37,980
everyone's best interest to kind of

2802
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,800
monitor these things just for peace of

2803
01:58:37,979 --> 01:58:43,738
mind right on right on and and if and if

2804
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:45,440
folks are new to this idea of cannabis

2805
01:58:43,738 --> 01:58:48,118
hyperemonis I'm

2806
01:58:45,439 --> 01:58:51,178
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

2807
01:58:48,118 --> 01:58:52,979
um uh we did an episode uh 80 on it with

2808
01:58:51,179 --> 01:58:55,440
Dr Ethan Russo whose name has come up a

2809
01:58:52,979 --> 01:58:57,000
lot today and uh and and it's a great

2810
01:58:55,439 --> 01:58:58,919
guy yeah he is and he's you know he's

2811
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,238
researched so much so it's you can't

2812
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:01,679
really talk about you know

2813
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:03,238
cannabinopathic medicine without

2814
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:06,179
tripping over a bunch of his research

2815
01:59:03,238 --> 01:59:08,339
right so uh so yeah so episode 80 if

2816
01:59:06,179 --> 01:59:11,099
you're new to that so all right so 100

2817
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:14,300
to to bring us to the close here you

2818
01:59:11,099 --> 01:59:17,219
know we've we've we have talked about

2819
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:21,239
kinematopathic medicine today in terms

2820
01:59:17,219 --> 01:59:24,118
of of longevity and and not only the

2821
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:27,118
length of life but also the quality of

2822
01:59:24,118 --> 01:59:28,979
life and and instead of like you know

2823
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:32,639
often we think about connect you know

2824
01:59:28,979 --> 01:59:35,399
cannabinoid medicine as oh this is broke

2825
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:38,099
how do I fix the broke thing in me right

2826
01:59:35,399 --> 01:59:40,979
um whereas when we're talking about life

2827
01:59:38,099 --> 01:59:43,980
lifelong wellness it's it's more about

2828
01:59:40,979 --> 01:59:46,799
like keeping the system going and

2829
01:59:43,979 --> 01:59:49,979
rebalancing itself rejuvenating itself

2830
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:54,659
keeping those systems functioning

2831
01:59:49,979 --> 01:59:57,359
um to bring us home what do you see as

2832
01:59:54,658 --> 01:59:59,879
the um you know the novel cannabinoids

2833
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:02,939
or the research that you are seeing

2834
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:07,380
evolve right now that hold a lot of

2835
02:00:02,939 --> 02:00:09,000
promise for longevity with uh cannabis

2836
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:11,699
medicine

2837
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:14,760
oh well I think it's a really

2838
02:00:11,698 --> 02:00:17,339
interesting topic I have an acute

2839
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:20,579
interest in both Botanical drug

2840
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:23,159
substances that combine or or include

2841
02:00:20,579 --> 02:00:26,340
multiple different cannabinoids to to

2842
02:00:23,158 --> 02:00:28,679
whether we want to say Entourage or uh

2843
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:31,139
additive super additive effects or

2844
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:34,560
rational polypharmacy there's a bunch of

2845
02:00:31,139 --> 02:00:36,139
ways to to term it but go to to treat

2846
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:39,000
disease

2847
02:00:36,139 --> 02:00:42,118
in combination by multiple different

2848
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:44,520
methods or mechanisms so I have a really

2849
02:00:42,118 --> 02:00:47,399
big interest in that and I think that

2850
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:49,739
relates directly with age-related

2851
02:00:47,399 --> 02:00:53,460
disease so maybe in preventative

2852
02:00:49,738 --> 02:00:55,559
medicine and maybe once you've passed

2853
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:58,139
preventative medicine maybe we can we

2854
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:59,940
can stabilize those conditions and the

2855
02:00:58,139 --> 02:01:02,099
other thing is these what I would

2856
02:00:59,939 --> 02:01:05,098
consider more novel cannabinoids things

2857
02:01:02,099 --> 02:01:06,960
that are understudied like the the acids

2858
02:01:05,099 --> 02:01:09,719
the the cannabinoid acids so before

2859
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:13,500
they're heated and um some of these

2860
02:01:09,719 --> 02:01:16,760
other cannabinoids like CBC and CBE and

2861
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:18,960
a lot of these really understudied uh

2862
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:20,940
cannabinoids that we just don't really

2863
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:23,279
know we know they're active we just

2864
02:01:20,939 --> 02:01:26,039
don't know where to use them and how to

2865
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:28,019
use them and how much we should use so I

2866
02:01:26,039 --> 02:01:30,319
I think I've got a lot more work ahead

2867
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:33,659
of me as well as as many other

2868
02:01:30,319 --> 02:01:36,840
cannabiners so to speak in the space

2869
02:01:33,658 --> 02:01:38,939
right on well uh Hunter thank you so

2874
02:01:48,238 --> 02:01:54,059
the other ability to be able to speak

2875
