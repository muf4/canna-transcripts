1
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:09,230
so Ethan you know um you often say that

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,769
it's important for patients to not

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:15,798
confuse psychoactivity with efficacy

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:17,809
meaning some patients think that they

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,969
need to get high for the cannabis

6
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,918
medicine to work and I hear this all the

7
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:23,570
time from people especially people who

8
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:25,129
are new to canvas medicine they're like

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,948
I don't want to do cannabis medicine

10
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:30,588
because I don't want to get high what do

11
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:32,539
you tell people to explain to them the

12
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:35,539
difference between the the psycho

13
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:38,149
activeness of some cannabinoids versus

14
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:39,589
the efficacy of them reducing the

15
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,890
symptoms that they're looking to help

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:47,180
with right well they don't necessarily

17
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:49,520
have to go together let's explain I am

18
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,670
NOT going to say that euphoria is a bad

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,609
thing and a touch of euphoria can be

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,789
great to a patient who's had a chronic

21
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:01,189
disorder and finally has experienced

22
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:03,140
some relief anybody's going to feel

23
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:06,368
great or euphoric under those

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:09,049
circumstances but to the Food and Drug

25
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:12,498
Administration before iya is listed as a

26
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:15,049
side effect and again many consumers

27
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:18,048
particularly cannabis naive people who

28
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:21,049
might benefit from its uses in medicine

29
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:24,770
aren't looking they have any level of

30
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:29,329
psycho activity they rather are seeking

31
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:34,129
symptom relief and it is the case and

32
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:36,379
has been established that most often

33
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:38,959
there's some sweet spot and using a

34
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:41,810
properly constituted cannabis based

35
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:45,739
medicine where in the patient has

36
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,269
symptoms all without adverse events

37
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,368
meaning without side effects

38
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:53,649
particularly of a psychoactive nature

39
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:56,539
and those would be anxiety paranoia

40
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,789
things you don't want as well as things

41
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:02,060
like euphoria which are not necessarily

42
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:05,689
bad but not necessary to get symptom

43
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,638
control so it's being amply demonstrated

44
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:10,399
and randomized controlled trials of

45
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:13,310
cannabis based medicines that you can

46
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,719
achieve pain control or control of

47
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,629
spasticity muscle

48
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:21,400
and multiple sclerosis bladder symptoms

49
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:24,949
any number of things without a

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,990
concomitant level of intoxication in

51
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:31,039
other words without being high or having

52
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:33,129
other associated problems and for most

53
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,409
people this is going to be the goal

54
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:39,169
the problem with psycho activity

55
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:42,620
associated with cannabis is more often

56
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:46,250
associated with smoking or with

57
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,890
vaporization because this creates a peak

58
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,370
of activity both serum levels and brain

59
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:54,679
levels a quick peek but also a quicker

60
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,409
offset and that's going to produce more

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,020
problems it means more frequent dosing

62
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:02,379
the greater chance of psychoactive side

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,420
effects on a greater chance of

64
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:08,060
reinforcement reinforcement is the idea

65
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:11,000
that drugs that are very short acting

66
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,390
are more likely to get people hooked if

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,990
you will now I can tell you that in

68
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:22,159
medical usage the risk of dependency on

69
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:25,610
cannabis is next than nothing however it

70
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,909
means a big concern for regulatory

71
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,690
bodies it's been shown that for instance

72
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:36,139
the cannabis based medicines Sativex has

73
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:38,599
a very low drug abuse liability in other

74
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:44,629
words risk of dependency or other

75
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:48,709
associated problems so you know if we're

76
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:51,530
setting aside that we want to have the

77
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,479
THC in the medicines so that we can take

78
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,870
advantage of the entourage effect so we

79
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,729
want to have some and and we want to use

80
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:07,909
the other minor cannabinoids and

81
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:10,310
terpenoids ample the anti-inflammatory

82
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,870
relief or that you know or working with

83
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,319
their migraines or the herbal bowels and

84
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,019
without folks necessarily feeling the

85
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,599
psycho activity of being high how can an

86
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,689
individual patient figure out how much

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,689
THC to have in the mix so that they have

88
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:27,389
enough for the entourage effect but not

89
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:28,918
enough

90
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,900
that they experienced the psychoactivity

91
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,968
or euphoria sure that they may not

92
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,628
necessarily want well everyone's

93
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:36,300
different

94
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,370
so what a patient needs depends on their

95
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,468
prior experience whether the use candles

96
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,579
cannabis before whether they might have

97
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:46,319
some degree of tolerance also something

98
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:49,050
we can't easily measure what we call

99
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,780
their endocannabinoid tone that means

100
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,030
how much endogenous cannabinoids they

101
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,429
have naturally in their system what is

102
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:58,799
the state of the receptors their density

103
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,889
and their activity level we know that

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,800
these are important but we don't know

105
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:07,889
how to measure those easily they're

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,478
still research techniques we can issue

107
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:14,639
some general guidelines on dosing

108
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:18,180
two-and-a-half milligrams of THC is a

109
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,098
threshold dose for most people some

110
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,769
people will feel it some will not

111
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:24,329
five is a moderate dose almost everyone

112
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:27,060
is going to feel unless they've

113
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:30,089
developed tolerance and ten milligrams

114
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,838
is going to be too much for someone

115
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:37,258
whose cannabis naive and should be about

116
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:40,740
as much as anyone would need in a single

117
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:43,288
dose again it makes a big difference the

118
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:48,000
route of delivery but that would be a

119
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:51,718
general guideline in chronic usage I

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,778
like people to limit their total dealing

121
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:57,750
usage of teetsi to somewhere in the 15

122
00:05:54,778 --> 00:06:00,209
and 20 milligram range exceptionally 30

123
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,709
milligrams beyond that we're talking

124
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:05,218
about a greater likelihood of

125
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:10,228
side-effects and not not a likelihood of

126
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:13,069
increased efficacy but with those levels

127
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:16,588
of THC we might have a great deal more

128
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:20,129
CBD necessary to treat certain

129
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:22,829
conditions but does it be general

130
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:25,139
guidelines so you said that dosage is

131
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:27,389
based you know a significance

132
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,829
consideration is tolerance and I

133
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,588
absolutely know that there's folks who

134
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:35,490
are watching who are taking you know 100

135
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:37,259
milligrams THC edibles right because say

136
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,460
for example their chronic pain patient

137
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,560
or something right it's the only thing

138
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,209
that gets them through their day so how

139
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,100
do you kind of jive those two where

140
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:46,319
where we want to keep people below 30

141
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,030
milligrams a day but with tolerance

142
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,189
we've got patients that are taking you

143
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:52,079
know 100 grams at 100 milligrams at once

144
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:55,079
right but it's just because of that

145
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,870
tolerance that they can handle 100

146
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,930
milligrams but it doesn't mean that that

147
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,149
number is necessary to really gain

148
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,180
symptom control so maybe if they were to

149
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:09,269
titrate down they would be able to get

150
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,180
the same relief for less money or what

151
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:15,419
right in fact there is a technique

152
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,540
that's been pioneered by Dustin Sulak my

153
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,689
colleague and main he calls a recess of

154
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,750
ization procedure he will have the

155
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:26,939
patient is using what seems to be too

156
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:31,079
much THC on a daily basis

157
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:35,430
stop for 48 hours it's not a week it's

158
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:39,389
not a month two days of nothing and then

159
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,670
resume at half the prior dose of THC and

160
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:44,699
what he's seen is the level of symptom

161
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:47,520
control at half the dose is just as good

162
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,469
as it was at the prior full dose so

163
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,009
essentially it's a it's a it's a short

164
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,530
intense tolerance break exactly

165
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,719
so with that you'd be able to hopefully

166
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:01,159
get the same benefits that you had been

167
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,480
getting out of a lot less milligrams

168
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,450
