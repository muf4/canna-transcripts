me in Port Orchard and so I'm over here

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,278
pretty regularly like fishing or crabing

8

over here today and Dan is showing me

10
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,880
the present state of his garden and I'm

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,960
all like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hold

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,399

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,840
this incredible Garden um let's go ahead

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,439
and take some photos and and get some

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,920
you know share it with everybody right

16
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,479
and so he's like yeah all right let's

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,600
set up some chairs so here we are right

18
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,038
so so thanks Dan for giving me a couple

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
minutes to like look at your garden of

20
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,280
course dude I'm just glad your

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,079
excitement brought us to this point you

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,039
know I'm excited about it this year and

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,280
um it's been fun so it's way better than

24
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,960
what I had last year and we could talk

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,558
about that too yeah actually we we

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,160
thought about doing this video last year

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,079
and then we just kind of stoned it and

28
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,038
didn't get to it but I'm glad now we

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,838
waited till this year because this

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,599
year's Garden is so much better yeah me

31
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:08,359
too so Dan what I'm thinking is let's

32
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,519
talk a little bit about the Cannabis

33
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,159
stuff that you're growing and then we'll

34
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,200
talk a little bit about the food stuff

35
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,840
since you know this is your home garden

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
corre and so you're providing food for

37
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,079
your family too so let's start with that

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,000
y um so so first of all like you your

39
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,158
main thing is uh breeding autof flowers

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,799
correct and uh you know you're

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,920
nationally known for that that's great

42
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,040
and you've been selling seeds for years

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,118
um but what's behind us here is uh some

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,799
new projects that you're working on so

45
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,840
um so why don't you tell us about that

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,320
first and as as you show them I'll show

47
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,240
some close-ups so go ahead absolutely so

48
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,279
behind us what you're seeing is the

49
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,478
actual 304 project that's come to a

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,680
close uh for the season and I say come

51
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,438
to a close you know we're working on it

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,240
and I'm super thrilled about it dude um

53
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:53,438
you know as you said nationally known

54
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,000
and I've gotten you've been selling

55
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,199
seeds there has been some good ones that

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,478
have come out but there hasn't been

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,240
anything as excited as I am for this

58
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,679
um there are several attributes I've

59
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,319
been hunting for the last few years

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,240
things that I've been trying to improve

61
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,159
from feedback from people out there I

62
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,519
know my Turk game was weak but I think

63
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,598
that we've turned that around you ran

64
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,520
your nose through here a little bit

65
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,479
earlier and uh I think things have

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
shifted on that point yeah it's huge gas

67
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,318
too right like like getting gas in an

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
Autoflower is hard right it's real hard

69
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,839
and that's the thing like it's there

70
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,878
right now we know they're volon it seems

71
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,000
to be even stranger and auto flowers it

72
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,159
tends to go away quicker sometimes we

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,959
just tend to lose it when it comes close

74
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,919
to harvest so we'll see how they come

75
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,239
out how they dry and see what's left

76
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,878
after that process as far as the turps

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,640
the second thing I'm super thrilled

78
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,318
about is what we've seen in testing

79
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,799
especially with Phil grown autos and

80
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:47,318
Farms is a lot of time cover crop can

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,280
outcompete the auto growth whether it be

82
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,679
from weather stress or anything that's

83
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,360
keeping them small or even in that

84
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,959
infancy stage where they're waiting to

85
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,760
take root sometimes the cover crop are

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,719
out you know out compete I have had that

87
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,799
problem myself the plant is growing but

88
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,318
the cover crop is passing it and it

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,640
chokes it out and that has become a I

90
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:06,079
don't want to say a big roadblock but a

91
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,079
common roadblock that I have seen over

92
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,080
the last couple years with farmers and

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,680
conversation and I have been looking for

94
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,799
a cultiv bar that can do two things for

95
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,480
the farmer transplant stability as we

96
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,159
all know Autos they can be transplanted

97
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,719
but you have to you know be diligent

98
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,519
about it and there's a timing window and

99
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,719
it can be done but I was looking for

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,760
something that can take a little bit

101
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,158
longer window and a smaller container

102
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,399
and still end up like what's behind us

103
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,120
here right you know we're in six got 10t

104
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,879
centers in here and majority of these

105
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,438
are 6t or taller I think the smallest

106
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,759
one in here was 6t these are the biggest

107
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:40,919
Auto flowers that I've seen and after

108
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,598
this year I've grown like 180 some

109
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,318
Autoflower varieties and I've never seen

110
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,598
anything this uh chunky or tall well and

111
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:48,878
these are the first ones that I've had

112
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:52,959
come out consisten consistently across a

113
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:56,518
lot I started 175 of these this year uh

114
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,120
150 made it out here out of that 150 it

115
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,480
got thinned down most males were removed

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,560
except for one two males and then two

117
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,639
females were then reversed uh for a

118
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,759
little bit of uh just a little bit of

119
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,158
play and something uh new just trying to

120
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,438
kind of keep some diversity in there and

121
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:12,479
just to see what happens I want to see

122
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:16,358
what ratios happen if we get an increase

123
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:19,319
of female just to see so the the 304 is

124
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,159
already in the market already so this is

125
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:25,000
the new generation uh is this are these

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,759
f3s or what so that's correct so there

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,160
are f3s that are currently available in

128
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,960
the market as reg only these are making

129
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,560
the F4 the selections were done from

130
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,038
what I called the pink selection from

131
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,800
the end of last summer which were pink

132
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:40,319
flowers as well as pink uh pistols so it

133
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,919
was a Private Selection working for the

134
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,360
F4 they were the larger of the group

135
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,758
they were late season last year they

136
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,840
were specifically ran to look for the

137
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,199
mold mildew as well as their rapidness

138
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,560
to growth to harvest these are over 90

139
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,079
days now I think cuz they were started

140
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,560
at June 1st um it's definitely Beyond 90

141
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,680
days but you're you're not growing for

142
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,120
flower you're actually seeded so it

143
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,240
makes sense that you would be growing

144
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,840
more than 90 days so that you could get

145
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,000
really nice finished zebra striped seeds

146
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,399
well correct yeah you beat me to the

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,439
punch there like I would definitely say

148
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,599
these are easily takeable between 70 and

149
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,839
80 days which is what I want and that's

150
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,199
6 and seven and 8T from germination to

151
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:21,000
finish to this size behind us 70 to 80

152
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,720
days so um I'm sure that anybody who is

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,038
familiar with autoflowers and is seeing

154
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,080
this is all like how how are these so

155
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,719
chunky and big and you know certainly we

156
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,639
all know the importance of good genetics

157
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,680
right it doesn't matter if it's

158
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,038
autoflowers or photos or tomatoes right

159
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,319
it's like good genetics are super

160
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:40,639
important so so setting that aside for a

161
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,600
minute what the hell else are you doing

162
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,840
because everything around here is so

163
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,199
huge and and I'm sure that people are

164
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,638
going to be like what the what the hell

165
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,000
else is he using cuz because um you know

166
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,639
you're not an a+b kind of chemical guy

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,680
you're not force feeding them no these

168
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,600
the nothing in here is force fed at all

169
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,240
everything that is sitting around us is

170
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,720
100% fed through the line only on water

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,360
um now I do incorporate compost te's uh

172
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,880
worm casting te's are my base um this

173
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,400
gives me an opportunity here too I'm

174
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,159
getting ready to do a little work with

175
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,318
Luna and we're going to put together a

176
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,599
compost tea so stay tuned for that uh

177
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,879
we're going to do a collaboration

178
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:16,759
together and we'll go over the kind of

179
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,240
compost tea I typically use and I think

180
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,479
we're going to set up one that she uses

181
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,879
and recommendations and kind of show so

182
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,598
that you know stay tuned for that more

183
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,159
on that later but um the rest of it uh

184
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:28,038
behind us all the Autos are in a

185
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,520
seven-year Hogle bed that's chopped and

186
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,038
dropped every year uh um some dry

187
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,799
amendments are added throughout you know

188
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:37,120
the winter months but then mulch back

189
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,400
over and then cover crops and that's

190
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,079
about it like so pretty much it's it's

191
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,079
um a pre fortified substrate yep you

192
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,000
don't feed them during the season but

193
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,800
you keep the microbes um vibrant by um

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
by reinforcing them with uh compost

195
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,079
cheese 100% all right and I think the

196
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,598
biggest thing for me over wintering I've

197
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,079
tried multiple different things in here

198
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:00,598
as far as like mulching layers over

199
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,038
wintering to kind of keep that alive on

200
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:04,680
the soil surface straw does good but you

201
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,839
have to deal with a lot of grass you're

202
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,160
going to have to cut it out you pull it

203
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,638
out you're going to lose some root mass

204
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,039
when you do that it's not a big deal uh

205
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,840
but again it can come up but what I have

206
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,639
found and I am lucky is I have a friend

207
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,239
who is a woodworker and he turns tables

208
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,038
and bowls and stuff like that and he

209
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,079
gives me these giant contractor bags of

210
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,719
nothing but hardwood shavings now it's

211
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:24,639
not chunk it's real thin shavings and

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,440
you can see it behind us and has become

213
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,639
the perfect mulching layer to keep that

214
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,079
top surface moist and the microbes alive

215
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,400
all the way to the surface

216
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,719
I think that's key being able to have

217
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:36,038
the roots go take full advantage of the

218
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,520
area that they're in one of the things

219
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,878
that's important about uh using this

220
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,478
type of oh yeah there's some right here

221
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,479
this this type of uh what did you call

222
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,758
these shavings yeah shavings I use these

223
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,959
to and uh Leon Morrison taught me

224
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,560
something really important about these

225
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,758
because a lot of people are concerned

226
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,158
about um uh using wood chips on top

227
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,240
because the biological processes they go

228
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:59,800
through can actually suck nitrogen out

229
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,918
of your soil right but these when you

230
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,038
get them from someone who turns wood

231
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,719
these are all precured right so they're

232
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:09,439
they're denatured and so they take a lot

233
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,400
longer time to break down and they break

234
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,439
down in a different way which means that

235
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,079
they're not um stealing the nitrogen

236
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,519
from your soil I use those too and I

237
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,120
swear by them if you can get your hands

238
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,719
on them oh absolutely 100% you know and

239
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,280
I'm fortunate enough to get those bags

240
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,599
actually he pesters me about like hey I

241
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,439
got like six of these bags you want them

242
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:25,839
yep sure do and we've gotten it down to

243
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,478
a rhythm now he usually hits me up in

244
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,918
the spring and in the fall or in the

245
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:30,478
winter you know when the crops come down

246
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:31,799
but he knows out here mulching yeah

247
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,958
right on so it's a really good cover if

248
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
you can get your hands on it you know

249
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:39,158
somebody use it right on so those are

250
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,278
the 304s autof flowers behind us y so so

251
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:44,158
um Dan doesn't really as far as I'm

252
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,600
aware of uh breed photo periods all that

253
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,838
much anymore no I only use them for new

254
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,959
source of genetics to make uh you know

255
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,600
to bring in new lines so these photo

256
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,278
these photo periods this is all your

257
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,320
head stash right yeah yeah right on so

258
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,439
majority of it yeah so so clearly the

259
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,120
autof flowers are well ahead of the

260
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,079
photo periods which I'll tuck in some

261
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,159
photos here um why don't you tell us um

262
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:07,199
uh about uh you know plug plug the

263
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,759
people who you respect that you're

264
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,600
growing their photo periods this year

265
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,240
yeah so you know I've got like most

266
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,959
Growers and most people in the Cannabis

267
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
industry I have a freezer full of seeds

268
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,799
and I had some stuff that I collected

269
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,959
from years of people who I looked up to

270
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,599
as well as I have watched um their

271
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,599
breeding practices and stuff over the

272
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
years and you know I didn't want some of

273
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,959
these seeds to go to the wayte and I

274
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,079
picked a couple of them that just you

275
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,039
know W newer and some that I've had from

276
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:34,639
years go um ital Foundation from

277
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,360
California and then dead pan head from

278
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,078
Oregon I think he's in Oregon that's

279
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,399
what I come to understand but I've got

280
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,078
some of their cultivars out here this

281
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,639
year and I was looking to go old school

282
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:47,958
I would like there's a lot of indicia

283
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:50,600
influence out here og3 uh white gas

284
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:53,439
there's triangle Kush M10 and then the

285
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,560
Platinum p so nice little mix and some

286
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,079
stuff to play with uh to bring in new

287
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:58,518
you know genetics into the Auto World so

288
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:00,319
I get both the head stash and then the

289
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,959
auto males and the pollen donors are

290
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,278
gone way before it becomes a danger to

291
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,799
the photo periods in here some of the

292
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,159
pre- flowers got pollinated and that's

293
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,278
just enough for me to take a look at the

294
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,519
seed if the photo period comes out to

295
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,919
something I like which I got to give

296
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,519
credit to one and it's the TK M10 cross

297
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:20,278
the um the Platinum PI from itall from

298
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,320
itall yeah it is way ahead of the group

299
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:23,639
there's two side by side as you can see

300
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,160
and I'm sure he'll have pictures for you

301
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,120
guys to see here later um you can tell

302
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,399
that they they look nothing alike the

303
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,039
only reason you know they're from the

304
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,120
the same you know group of seeds is cuz

305
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,319
they're labeled but that one is stand

306
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,959
out it is it's amazing it's way ahead

307
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,600
it's going to I would say what would you

308
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,958
maybe two weeks left on that plant maybe

309
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,000
three and that was no light depth just

310
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:46,559
you know L natural something I was

311
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,039
looking for out of what two four six but

312
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,479
however many are in the row yeah and

313
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,679
living here in the Pacific Northwest

314
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,879
we're always looking for anything that's

315
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,838
a fast flower 100% it also makes my life

316
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,200
easy as an auto breeder too yeah yeah

317
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,880
right right so cool so we've talked

318
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,519
about your Autoflower this year the

319
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,559
three for and your photo periods for

320
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,360
your head stash and photo period

321
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:10,559
explanation or exploration um let's talk

322
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,879
about this freaking tomato plant here um

323
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,559
so so so I know that these are just two

324
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,639
tomato plants cuz I brought them to you

325
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,879
from Vashon Island correct how the hell

326
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,759
did this monstrosity happen um that

327
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,720
monstrosity is a direct result of an

328
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,759
above ground hoole bed mhm uh so

329
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,560
basically like the same thing that's

330
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,919
buried behind us but in 100 gallon

331
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:33,319
country line Farm tank drill the bottom

332
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:37,399
out logs layers and leaf mulch and you

333
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,120
know um have you been taken um uh fruit

334
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,839
off of it yet oh yeah we've had fruit

335
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,039
out of it um I think it's gotten too

336
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,040
shaded now it's been uh kind of slowed

337
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,480
down on the fruit production but

338
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,319
everything starting to finally ripen up

339
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,639
which is nice but it's loaded there's

340
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,680
pounds of tomatoes Z inside there right

341
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,000
yeah it really took off this year and

342
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,479
it's same treatment you know worm

343
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,839
castings tea um and some foler another

344
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,360
thing that's looking good even though

345
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,440
it's in your first year is is um your

346
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,399
strawberries um I remember when you sent

347
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,920
me the picture of the box that you had

348
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,200
made and you were all like baked and was

349
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:12,278
late and you were all like like look

350
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,440
what I made dude and so um it looks

351
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,759
really good thank you yeah and so it

352
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,079
looks like we're at the end of your

353
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,600
strawberry season but it looks like you

354
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:20,399
got a hell a lot yeah I was really

355
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,159
impressed you know I mean as you can see

356
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,399
you know behind you there or in front of

357
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,879
you here we've got the three pots that

358
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,480
the donors came from but they did turn

359
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,399
around really well and started producing

360
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,959
I expect by next next summer it'll be

361
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,958
really nice it was kind of A Midsummer

362
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,319
thing trying to get these thinned out

363
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:36,439
and trying to kind of get my corn SL

364
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Berry Patch going kind of another you

365
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,959
know new area to play in yeah and the

366
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,639
berries like since it's their first year

367
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,119
it's not all grown in you've got gaps so

368
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,639
they can they can expand and stuff so by

369
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,000
next year it'll be all full oh that'll

370
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,039
be crazy back in there with berries that

371
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,360
year it'll be really nice yeah um you

372
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,000
know not a lot of people grow corn in

373
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,519
the Pacific Northwest where we live

374
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,600
because the summer like this summer is

375
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,720
hella short and it doesn't doesn't get

376
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,480
hot nope and um and I know last year uh

377
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,720
you grew corn and um all you grew was a

378
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,399
bunch of swearing yeah pretty much but

379
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,680
then but then this year you've been

380
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:14,278
given corn to like all your neighbors

381
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:16,000
and everything so so so a like you know

382
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:17,559
why did you decide to bother with corn

383
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,480
in the Pacific Northwest when it was

384
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,719
probably going to be a fail and and um

385
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,000
what did you do different this year

386
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,759
versus last year that you're actually

387
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,278
getting like buttloads of corn yeah um

388
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,919
so the corn thing is Nostalgia for me my

389
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,720
grandfather used to grow yards and yards

390
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:34,159
and yards of corn we always grew yards

391
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,040
of corn we always love it it's a great

392
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:39,078
summertime treat the boy absolutely just

393
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,799
smashes it um so that was the area of

394
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,120
the old greenhouse and that soil was

395
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,120
worked initially because it was sand I

396
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,639
was growing in ground back then you know

397
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,480
new experimentation trying to figure out

398
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,799
the ground so I was like I don't want to

399
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,199
really waste this there's nothing really

400
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,799
going on here I was like corn would be a

401
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,599
good idea so the first year with all the

402
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,639
swearing was learning my phenotypes you

403
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
know I bought several different

404
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,159
varieties from the local Ace Hardware

405
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,639
and

406
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,120
one out of the group produced a couple

407
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,600
ears the rest were nothing but

408
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,198
ornamental for Halloween yeah there you

409
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,399
go this year however uh one of the

410
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,319
things that impacted me last year too

411
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,120
was crowding I got too excited and

412
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,639
didn't thin enough um but this year the

413
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,360
cultivar that did produced the couple

414
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,360
ears we had last year produced in

415
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,720
numbers and I wish I could give you the

416
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,278
name but I can't remember it but I did

417
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,160
find it today's hardware and it's a 65

418
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,559
day cultivar so with our [ __ ] weather I

419
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,039
applied the same knowledge to Auto

420
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,758
flowers and growing cannabis here if it

421
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,120
has a short flowering period maybe we'll

422
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,800
actually get something and it worked out

423
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,240
fantastic uh this is actually heirloom

424
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,479
this year it was saved from the corn

425
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,120
from last year that actually made it

426
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,920
since I didn't need it I figured [ __ ] it

427
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,399
save it yeah yeah so but it did great

428
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,078
this year we saved a few more ears and

429
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,399
I'm just going keep it going so when I

430
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,278
showed up and after I said all my like

431
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:57,679
holy crap comments because this Garden

432
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,439
is so it's so much larger than last year

433
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,479
not like number of plants but but each

434
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,160
plant is so much bigger and um you know

435
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,039
we grow a lot of the same things

436
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,399
especially since we're friends and and I

437
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,838
get your seeds right but your stuff is

438
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,440
so much bigger than it's ever been and

439
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,639
one of the things that you

440
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,079
do

441
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,159
um excuse me guys sorry about that there

442
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:23,319
there's a road nearby yeah so um one of

443
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,838
the things that you do is um uh you run

444
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,040
lines to water right yeah and um you

445
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,800
know I'm a big fan of hand watering so

446
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:32,799
that I can you know adjust the water for

447
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,240
different plants but I got to tell you

448
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,039
I'm getting closer and closer to the

449
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:42,000
idea of installing water lines because

450
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:44,719
this just shows the magic of consistent

451
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,480
small amounts of watering so when I

452
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,319
water the plant is the the pot is all

453
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,959
super wet and then it gets all hella dry

454
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:55,278
and then it gets wet and then it gets

455
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,439
dry and and um and you know it would

456
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,600
probably be better if I was doing a

457
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,399
little bit every day right but but you

458
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,440
know I'm working to I tend to do like

459
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,240
every other day right and that kind of

460
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,079
makes the the the case even more that I

461
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,560
should have some kind of drip irrigation

462
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,039
going so um why don't we just take a

463
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,039
second and just like plug drip

464
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,198
irrigation as a theme uh drip as a theme

465
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,679
do it just plain and simple with the

466
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:21,278
wood mulch and the consistent watering

467
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,799
my plants are bigger than they ever have

468
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,198
been and I'm saving water that's the

469
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,078
other big thing that I think people are

470
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,078
missing I'm literally saving water these

471
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:31,318
lines don't run all the time I have have

472
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:32,799
it I mean I come out here to look when I

473
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:34,360
do the compost te's obviously I'm

474
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,919
looking at it and I can see if the top

475
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,519
layer is starting to dry back but it

476
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,078
doesn't dry back because I have

477
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,679
everything on timers everything comes in

478
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,120
and if you want good consistent yields

479
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,159
with healthy plants across the board I

480
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,919
mean you can see here I mean even the

481
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,679
hle bed has spray heads that consistent

482
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,719
top layer again it comes back to what I

483
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:53,919
said earlier if those roots can use that

484
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,440
top fraction of that soil that's a

485
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,198
fraction area they're able to pour more

486
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,880
fruit from if you can protect it and

487
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:59,758
keep that alive I think that's why

488
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,720
you're seeing what we're see in here

489
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,680
today yeah I've just had a really just

490
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,240
like put all that this is what you're

491
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,759
seeing is what I'm practicing like it's

492
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,160
a direct result of what I'm saying right

493
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:13,720
here just that consistent watering and a

494
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,038
mulch around so um the last thing I want

495
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,759
to finish up with is just um you know I

496
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,679
have seen your Gardens now many years in

497
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:24,359
a row correct and and every year they

498
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:26,759
get better um what have you learned from

499
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,240
this year that you already know that you

500
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,519
want to incorporate next year and as

501
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,960
something new learned something new

502
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,960
learned definitely needs some more air

503
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,880
flow uh definitely need more you've

504
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,600
already got fans all over the place

505
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,120
still not enough eh still not enough uh

506
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,159
there's microclimates in here still um

507
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,479
like I'll see tiny little pockets of PM

508
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,120
where I don't see it anywhere else and

509
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,880
that frustrates me like I don't I know

510
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,399
it's like unavoidable to keep it outside

511
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,400
of and I'm not you know we're not going

512
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,919
to live in a powdery Miler free zone

513
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,960
here yeah it's ignorant to think about

514
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,679
but I've got a pretty good grip on where

515
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,960
the microclimates are in here but I

516
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,919
still would like to improve air flow um

517
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,000
I think would be the next thing um I'm

518
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,720
definitely going to switch some of the

519
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,200
irrigation heads the like we were

520
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,558
talking about earlier when we move these

521
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,880
pots the drip irrigation that had the

522
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,599
the laser cut holes in them you can work

523
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,679
them into the soil you can layer them

524
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:20,639
all the way down and it keeps that

525
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,440
moisture even throughout that pot low

526
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,159
and consistent that way they always have

527
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,840
that source of water I think that's

528
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,280
something I'm definitely going to

529
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,119
improve cuz I kind of hbri it if you

530
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,599
look down through here and maybe you can

531
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:31,319
grab some shot you'll see some that have

532
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,798
heads in the top some that I've come

533
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,359
back through and retrofitted with the

534
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,480
actual buried lines and the buried lines

535
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,839
plants are definitely I think they're

536
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,159
more robust if I'm looking down through

537
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:43,798
here to be honest I got to agree too so

538
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,720
but yeah right cool man that's and then

539
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:48,599
um one thing that I learned from last

540
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,079
year that I want they Incorporated this

541
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:53,678
year that was a success I think is

542
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:56,240
important to talk about was being um

543
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,240
prophylactic with my mites I had a very

544
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,240
bad M issue last year for some reason

545
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,839
this side of this where I'm at over here

546
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,519
the two spot loves to thrive and got in

547
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,798
early with californicus and stayed

548
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,798
consistent monthly with it and it really

549
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:10,960
kicked their rear in I'm really

550
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,720
impressed with the californ Smite yep I

551
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,519
I don't have any thrips this year like I

552
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,038
had one leaf I found earlier and then my

553
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,319
two spot has been nil I found two leavs

554
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:22,158
I think through all my scouting and as

555
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,319
you can see I prune heavily and yeah

556
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,720
they're definitely a beast to have in

557
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,720
the garden right on yeah cool dude well
