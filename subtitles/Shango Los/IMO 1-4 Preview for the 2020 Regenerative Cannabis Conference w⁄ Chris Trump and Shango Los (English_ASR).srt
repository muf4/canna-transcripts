someone was just asking about pears

22
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:07,310
this time of year pears are probably

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:11,810
ripe and we call that fermented fruit

24
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,259
juice and he's ripe fruit yeah I'll be

25

00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:19,818
humble I hope you'll be there fermented

27
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,518
fruit juice is easy it's just like fpj

28
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:25,548
but you use it more for ripening your

29
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:48,620
crop than use it for general use so we

30
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:52,370
don't use that right fruit yes so it's

31

I know cool thanks for us so so I am

88
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:25,430
host and founder of shaping fire in the

89
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,740
shaping fire podcast and it started out

90
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,478
as as a podcast because I was reaching

91
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,639
out to the people who I was most

92
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:33,889
interested in the industry to ask him

93
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,750
the questions that I thought was we're

94
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:43,819
missing from the conversation and so

95
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:46,218
that's the lost you just for a second

96
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:49,699
alright so yeah sorry about that I don't

97
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:51,139
know how what happened but anyway so

98
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,400
yeah so I interview people on my show

99
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,680
and I ask them the questions I think

100
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,638
that are being missed in the general

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,968
cannabis conversation and and then and

102
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,610
then much to my pleasure a YouTube

103
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:06,560
channel spun off of it as well because I

104
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,770
go to so many events and I see other

105
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,310
good speakers and so I just go ahead and

106
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:12,649
record

107
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,560
them and put them on my youtube-channel

108
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:18,229
Brett shaping or over at a Shango Lowe's

109
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,300
and so so that's what I do I've got the

110
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,850
I've got the the podcast that's audio

111
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,120
only that comes out I add shaping fire

112
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,410
calm and then this you know this YouTube

113
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,069
channel that's kind of taken off it

114
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,240
serves like 50,000 unique people a month

115
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:35,089
there's like over a hundred and fifty

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,370
videos there me talking with other

117
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:39,229
cannabis folks and then and then just

118
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,240
stuff that I see that's awesome so I

119
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,759
tell people is that if I see it you see

120
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,430
it so anyway but that's but today it

121
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,029
stays not about like us right today it's

122
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:53,240

00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:11,569
people who are either new to KNF and

130
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,360

131
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:31,339
they've jumped in but they really want a

132
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:34,310
reappropriation the why behind so you've

133
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:36,500

work with your plants so okay so with

135
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,919
that but today we're really here to talk

136
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,290
about the regenerative conference that

137
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,500
that Joshua and Layton have put together

138
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:49,370
and because you know what's coming up

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,080
and and and you know people are talking

140
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,060
about it people buying their tickets and

141
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,879
I know I'm really excited to go to both

142
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:59,569
the Humboldt event and the mission again

143
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,980
event but but you know a lot of people

144
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,100
are like oh you know it's the same

145
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,539
speakers in the same cities and if I

146
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,220
live in one of these cities why would I

147
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:11,389
go again and then and and I and I get

148
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,180
that right because you think oh I've

149
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:16,909
heard that speaker right but but I've

150
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:19,279

I'm always getting new stuff from you

156
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:31,409

157
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,449

160
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:41,310

166
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,519
you're in the regenerative agriculture

167
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,290
if you're into living soil if you care

168
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,289
about their rhizosphere if you're in the

169
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:02,519
microbes you know do what you can to go

170
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:04,740
to the climbing hell I'm flying to

171
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,100
Michigan on my own dime to go to it to

172
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,629
see it a second time because every time

173
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,139
I catch one of the conference's I

174
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:15,269
learned so much so so so Chris why don't

175
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,889
we you know why don't we kind of use you

176
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,379
for an example right because we've we've

177
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:21,960
got like our they they've got like you

178
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,820
know eight or nine speakers and and

179
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,930
everybody's kind of got their oh this is

180
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,670
what we did last year this we're gonna

181
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:28,889
do this year but but why don't we take

182
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:31,139
you as an example man why don't you talk

183
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:33,360
about what you're gonna talk about this

184
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,279
year and and why it's different than

185
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,200
last year because because in the end

186
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,659
we're all we're all here in service of

187
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,830
regenerative agriculture and we we want

188
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,230
to encourage people to go to the

189
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,700
conference so I mean we're not gonna be

190
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,409
shy about that you know we want you to

191
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,810
come out and and be part of the

192
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:50,909
community so so what are you planning

193
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:54,119
for this year that is not what you did

194
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:57,659
last year brother yeah that's a that's a

195
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,899
great question I think the the speakers

196
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:03,149
I've talked to everybody's got that

197
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:04,980
approach you know they're they they are

198
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,329
excited about new things they're excited

199
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,539
about what they've done in the last year

200
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:12,720
and how things are changing and I think

201
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:17,610
of of any industry in in our country

202
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,029
right now the the cannabis world is has

203
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,800
some drastic changes and and and

204
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:24,389
discoveries I tell people all the time

205
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,338
that you know that aren't in the

206
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:28,679
industry and the cannabis industry at

207
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:32,040
home you know the greatest botany work

208
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:34,759
of any generation is in in the cannabis

209
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:37,279
world and the the discoveries and

210
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,899
genetics of

211
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:44,289
and things people have learned in that

212
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:47,600
in the last 50 years is pretty amazing

213
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:51,319
for me Josh and Layton and I talked this

214
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:56,629
year and you know one of the things that

215
00:11:51,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I like about this conference is the hope

216
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:03,200
or the idea that this serves to better

217
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,700
the farmers and those that are in the

218
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:12,200
industry to to really equip and and give

219
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:15,200
tools for people to succeed my part to

220
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,300
play is in the natural farming and and

221
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,450
helping people understand but also

222
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:22,849
succeed in that and one of the things

223
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,480
that I see just and a lot of

224
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:29,750
interactions is people struggle with

225
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,039
understanding but also implementing the

226
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,480
IMO process this idea of collecting

227
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:39,740
indigenous microbes from your local area

228
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,620
and getting it to go to work in your

229
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,919
growing environment for better

230
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:51,250
production equality and disease

231
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:54,469
resistance and so we're going to assume

232
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,450
hopefully not too much but assume that

233
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,370
some people have heard of natural

234
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:02,330
farming or have an introduction to it

235
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:06,110
and instead of kind of staying there you

236
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:07,639
make it fun of my beard brach a lot of a

237
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,350
lot of people are talking about it you

238
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,330
know you look good man like I tell you

239
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,820
the inner that the talk you did with

240
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,320
with Wendy and Suzanne and Joshua I

241
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,940
think that was maybe tomorrow yesterday

242
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:24,470
morning you look like a game of Thrones

243
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:26,150
character man yeah I asked my kids you

244
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,540
all right if I shave my beard because

245
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:31,279
I'm I get tired of the maintenance so it

246
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:33,799
might it might not be there and humble

247
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,449
we'll see and maybe we shave it off and

248
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:39,409
make IMO with it now I'm just kidding

249
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:42,200
but we're going to in the natural

250
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:46,458
farming talk we're going to this

251
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:50,030
demonstrate and jump in to IMO pretty

252
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:51,019
much wholeheartedly or for most of the

253
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,730
time

254
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:54,350
in each city some of the people that

255
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,180
have taken my class that are proficient

256
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,480
at it are going to do some prep work so

257
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:02,109
that people are coming and seen i am

258
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,610
only in action so these these hot piles

259
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,110
smelling like baking bread what's going

260
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,740
on in them we can throw it under the

261
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:12,470
microscope but also just taking people

262
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,299
through that process so if you've been

263
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,750
doing natural farming for a bit or

264
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:21,439
you're just starting being able to do I

265
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:24,289
am oh well is really the strength of the

266
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,660
whole thing and it's also not

267
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:29,719
necessarily the easiest thing there's

268
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:31,789
some nuance to it and so helping people

269
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,649
kind of get over some of the learning

270
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:39,379
curve and really do well with I am Oh

271
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:41,360
making I think it'll be a lot of fun

272
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:45,500
we'll do some hands-on we'll play with

273
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,919
it people can take stuff home and it'll

274
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:52,220
be really a deep dive into that one part

275
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:54,979
of the natural farming process which for

276
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,180
me as a farmer and for a lot of people

277
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:03,200
in the different crops they're growing

278
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:05,959
natural farming if you have IMO it's you

279
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:10,430
have really 80% of the the benefit the

280
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:13,250
nutrients all this stuff is la B and F

281
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:15,169
PJ is so important and people have so

282
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,509
much success with it but then they're

283
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:20,979
not even trying IMO because it seems a

284
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:24,110
bit and it's daunting or kind of

285
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,090
intimidating to get started with and so

286
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,120
I'd like to dissuade some of those fears

287
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:32,360
and really give people a hearty hearty

288
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,509
pleasure or encouragement into really

289
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,389
succeeding with that whole I am a 1 2 3

290
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:40,759
&amp; 4 process how to do it where you bring

291
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:44,870
in high nitrogen if you want to prep for

292
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:46,850
planting and yeah just kind of answer

293
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,340
all those questions there's there's

294
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,769
plenty of time we can spend on that and

295
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,470
I didn't really touch that in the last

296
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:56,840
time I spoke so it for me it'll be

297
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,990
pretty much a whole new whole new

298
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,389
conversation and if you don't know

299
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,190
natural farming at all or haven't had an

300
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:04,809
introduction go check out shaping fire

301
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,070
and episode

302
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:10,959
thirty-five or or check out my YouTube

303
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:13,270
just search Chris Trump and you're gonna

304
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,870
get that introduction you need to not be

305
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:18,970
lost at the the science of regenerative

306
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,250
cannabis cultivation conferences this

307
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,170
year you know that's a good point to

308
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,960
that get the information you need so you

309
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:27,849
don't get lost because even though you

310
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,480
know beginners are absolutely welcome

311
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:33,580
and embraced and and you know usually at

312
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,990
the beginning of folks talk there's a

313
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,150
little bit to kind of give you some

314
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,730
context and move you in but this is not

315
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:42,129
like 101 level stuff that you get at

316
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,170
most conferences right like most of the

317
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:46,899
conference's that you can go to in

318
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:49,240
cannabis they will give you basic stuff

319
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:51,250
when you're not looking at the booths

320
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,930
and you're not you know looking at the

321
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,730
vendors and stuff but this is

322
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:57,099
specifically an educational conference

323
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,080
where it's not about we want you to buy

324
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,980
stuff from the vendors and we also have

325
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,650
speakers this is a hardcore intensive

326
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,390
for people who are for nerds for this

327
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,880
people who are oppression it you know

328
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,640
who really want to get into it and so

329
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,920
this is more like a 300 400 level class

330
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,170
for people who it's assumed you already

331
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,660
have a base of knowledge because we want

332
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,189
to take you farther along and and I

333
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,040
think that I think that's important

334
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:26,110
though right because not only if for

335
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:28,509
people who have already started to wade

336
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:32,139
in that they think of natural farming is

337
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:34,299
important to them it's it becomes harder

338
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,950
and harder to get legit information

339
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:39,460
especially harder to get legit

340
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,830
information in English and and you know

341
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,130
you can kind of translate these skills

342
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:47,439
and you know the heart of it for these

343
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,150
people who are already interested but

344
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,549
they want to refine their game so that's

345
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,890
pretty cool so Chris one more question

346
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:57,190
on that you know oh you know you were

347
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,810
talking about this IMO kind of workshop

348
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,990
that you're gonna do within the bigger

349
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,759
conference so for people that that were

350
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,789
there last year do you think it would be

351
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:09,129
fair to say that last year you did kind

352
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:12,460
of an overview of natural farming and

353
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:15,679
then you you answered very specific

354
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,840
upper level questions at each

355
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,580
conference but then this year you're

356
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,049
like okay instead of giving this

357
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:24,230
upper-level thing and having the

358
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:27,139
questions be very in-depth we are gonna

359
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,720
dive right into this one area of natural

360
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,610
farming because when we when you leave

361
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,170
it do you want everybody to feel

362
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:37,209
comfortable and like they can run with

363
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:40,009
it yeah yeah so it'll be kind of

364
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:44,630
specific the geese are coming in look

365
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:49,640
sound good yeah it's a beautiful time of

366
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:51,590
day yeah it'll be it'll be narrower so

367
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,259
instead instead of trying to introduce

368
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:56,089
people assuming some people don't really

369
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,819
know and and I can't tell you how many

370
00:18:56,089 --> 00:19:02,500
people were introduced to concepts they

371
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:05,240
just no idea and and we had a lot of

372
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,660
people excited about what they were

373
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,970
doing

374
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:12,558
out of those regenerative conferences

375
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:16,009
last year and but this year going kind

376
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:18,859
of there's not enough time to go into

377
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:21,259
everything there's not enough time we do

378
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:22,428
five day intensive here in Boise and

379
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:24,730
there's not enough time to go into

380
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:29,030
everything in you know 40 hours of

381
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,799
Education so with the time we have at

382
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:33,139
the regenerative conference this being

383
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,669
the first four kind of where we're

384
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,540
having the conversation we need to go

385
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,100
deeper down down these these trails I

386
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:46,190
think Josh that deeper down the rabbit

387
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:48,500
hole the one of the things we kind of

388
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,740
identified in natural farming is if we

389
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:54,859
can go down here and people's questions

390
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,230
then are getting kind of tangibly answer

391
00:19:54,859 --> 00:20:01,509
they're getting to see things and we

392
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:05,000
talked about it in person while doing it

393
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:07,579
what could that do - yeah bolster and

394
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,500
boost people in their beginning of their

395
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:13,279
journey with natural farming so yeah

396
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:17,240
it'll be it'll be nerdy stuff for sure

397
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,670
and for me it doesn't exclude really all

398
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:24,470
the regenerative type practices so IMO

399
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:27,410
is really in in line with or kind of of

400
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,910
the same it's its nature you know we're

401
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,820
all playing with the same

402
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,350
rules and and so as we talk with other

403
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:37,849
people doing things in regenerative

404
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:41,269
agriculture it's not only will we talk

405
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:44,869
about the specifics of IMO creation and

406
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:47,420
using it on your plants and your soil or

407
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:52,669
preparation we'll talk about the concept

408
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:58,340
of why this kind of inoculation or this

409
00:20:52,670 --> 00:21:00,920
use of preps can give you a better

410
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:02,629
product and we'll get some great

411
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,380
testimonies that people that have been

412
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,730
doing this now for a couple years

413
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:12,100
Wendy's Wendy's going to talk all about

414
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:15,799
it I'm sure and just how much the

415
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:18,529
processors are excited about people

416
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:20,899
using regenerative processes people

417
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:25,069
using IMO because they're getting a

418
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,840
better product and that matters

419
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:33,649
especially as the industry shifts and

420
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:38,209
people are trying to make a bunch of not

421
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:41,240
so good or maybe I don't I don't know

422
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:44,990
get into that today but you know as as

423
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:48,529
the the need to set yourself apart and

424
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:51,230
your product apart from other people in

425
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,910
the industry or just in general to have

426
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,680
a name for what you're doing I think

427
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:58,070
it's really important that the quality

428
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,470
is looked at and so the biggest

429
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:02,929
component from what I see or my

430
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,880
understanding and and some of you know

431
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,880
who else will be talking is you know

432
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,630
what is your soil life like and so I am

433
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,900
Mo's yeah it's it's basically a really

434
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,640
inexpensive and effective shoe into

435
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:20,330
taking care of microbial life in your

436
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,960
soil and reaping the benefits you know I

437
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:27,139
watched the interview that you did with

438
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,019
Wendy and Suzanne with Joshua the other

439
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,880
day and you you uh you joined a little

440
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:34,000
late after the two of them had already

441
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,160
said what they were gonna do different

442
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,769
this year and and I think it's important

443
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,090
to be pointed out that everybody knows

444
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:44,158
that they're coming back this year

445
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:47,548
coming to the same cities so everybody

446
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,650
has got brand-new stuff and you know

447
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:52,408
it's it's difficult to summarize other

448
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:54,559
people's presentations right but I

449
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:59,039
watched the video enough to know that

450
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:00,839
for for Wendy she's bringing this new

451
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,669
insight she's got cuz by gosh she's

452
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,740
really taken to all the natural farming

453
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:09,090
stuff you know she's taken to it like a

454
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:11,429
like a bird to water and so so whereas

455
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:13,439
last year she was she was talking more

456
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,590
about basics cuz that's where she's at

457
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,019
she has dog in and is now gonna be

458
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:22,038
talking about more about separating fact

459
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,359
from fiction with natural farming and

460
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:26,490
dispelling rumors that she's been

461
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:29,158
hearing as people ask her questions and

462
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:32,190
also because she's a license holder

463
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,870
herself she does have that stuff that

464
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,720
you mentioned earlier about this the

465
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:39,719
real brass tacks about being a natural

466
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,929
farming grower and bringing those

467
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,909
products in to your local market and so

468
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:47,909
she's she's gonna have a lot of really

469
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:50,520
great new information on how like like

470
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:52,620
best practices for natural farming but

471
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,230
then also how to make it work in your

472
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:57,989
real life and make it matter to to your

473
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,259
business or your family you know and

474
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,120
then and then Suzanne Suzanne's all

475
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:04,980
excited she's got a whole new list of

476
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,558
pests that she wants to go through and

477
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,240
especially all the hot ones because you

478
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,700
know now that we've got clones going

479
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,009
back and forth across the country um all

480
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,509
these new pests are coming and they're

481
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:17,480
showing up in new parts of the country

482
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:20,759
that they haven't been seen before and

483
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,169
and as people's budgets get tighter

484
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,210
because you know people aren't really

485
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:26,460
making a lot of money in licensed

486
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,860
cannabis yet a lot of these folks are

487
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,990
being tempted to decrease their use of

488
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,750
beneficial insects so she'll be

489
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,640
addressing a lot of concerns that people

490
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:39,839
who are trying to put out legal cannabis

491
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,399
on a on a budget too so so that's good

492
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,129
and of course she's always great for

493
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:46,739
talking about medicine because Suzanne

494
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:49,980
is very much interested in making the

495
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,319
the end consumable product as safe for

496
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,788
everybody as possible so so the two of

497
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,200
them went through and and you can watch

498
00:24:53,788 --> 00:24:57,589
that on the

499
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,610
regenerate or regenerative organic

500
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:03,509
YouTube channel you can watch that

501
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:06,869
interview with you and and Wendy and

502
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:09,470
Suzanne and Joshua on the Don the Dutch

503
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:12,479
Bloom's page so so there's that as well

504
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:16,230
yeah such a great gathering people and

505
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:20,308
Wendy really has she's adopted these

506
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:24,120
things but she's also there there's a

507
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:26,970
point in in use where it's there's

508
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:29,189
intuitive understanding I'm specifically

509
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,769
in natural farming I see that there's

510
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,808
kind of okay I'm just gonna do the

511
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:36,538
recipe and then all of a sudden there's

512
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:38,759
like oh I get why this works and I can I

513
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:41,298
can do this because I understand why

514
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:44,250
that that thing that I might change

515
00:25:41,298 --> 00:25:46,589
could be beneficial and and Wendy's

516
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,839
there so yeah it'll be really fun to

517
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:51,359
hear how this is affecting their

518
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,449
business and it's hugely positive for

519
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,969
them so yeah coming and hearing a great

520
00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:00,090
grower with you know that

521
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,759
third-generation grower you know talk

522
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:05,398
about that shift and how it's affected

523
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:07,619
their bottom line I think is worth the

524
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:10,859
cost of admission but yeah there is

525
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:15,479
there's there's a whole gambit of these

526
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:17,158
these great speakers and and you can

527
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,009
take all of it

528
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,460
you know this whole conference and and

529
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:25,369
put it together and they're not nothing

530
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,649
nothing's in conflict you know there's

531
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:30,619
what Suzanne does and you know what

532
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:33,199
we're talking about in natural farming

533
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:37,018
the healthier plant the less of

534
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,080
susceptible you are to disease and bugs

535
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:42,359
and yeah it'll be it'll be a lot of fun

536
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,819
yeah what so Shengo you've been to a

537
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:48,359
couple of these what is your experience

538
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:50,220
of the culture the feel of this place

539
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,229
you know a few days

540
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,440
one thing I'm excited about is I've

541
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,269
freed up my schedule at a couple of the

542
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,269
conferences where as just tight I had to

543
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:02,700
get there be there for for speaking and

544
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:04,109
then go but this year I get to hang out

545
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,690
so I look forward to the side

546
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:08,639
conversations those really end up being

547
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,710
so so valuable

548
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,650
and and I have a lot of friends just

549
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:17,069
from two conferences now I've been to

550
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:20,250
where we have you know we talked outside

551
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:21,899
of industry and and yeah it's it's

552
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,420
special but what's your experience you

553
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,370
you're hanging out and and there's

554
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,590
there's a hundred like-minded people in

555
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:30,839
the room what does that feel like well

556
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:32,909
the first thing is it's nice to not feel

557
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:36,089
alone right because all of us growers

558
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,259
we're so used to you know not

559
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,389
necessarily talking about that they're

560
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,220
people about or just talking on online

561
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,540
but not actually getting that human

562
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,058
connection that you get when you get

563
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:47,700
with you know you're tried in person and

564
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:49,950
so no matter the location you're gonna

565
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,660
be pulling in all these people you know

566
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,230
you know from like you know three four

567
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,640
hours all around you and people are

568
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,140
coming together and it's and it feels

569
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,630
good and there's like there's like lots

570
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,669
of smiles and hugs and people sharing

571
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,380
stuff back and forth and so it's really

572
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:06,059
good to pull it together you can feel

573
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,380
the energy rise in the room which of

574
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:09,389
course for the speakers that gets

575
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,910
everybody jazzed as well because they

576
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,009
play off that and and you're all

577
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:16,410
learning together and kind of raising

578
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:19,379
the the understanding of the whole

579
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:22,590
community and and but I found a lot in

580
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,570
Michigan last year was that um you find

581
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:26,459
people who are gonna ask a question and

582
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:29,069
sometimes it's about sourcing something

583
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,829
or maybe it's about like a convey you

584
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:33,899
know a query about some kind of natural

585
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:36,720
input they have and they'll ask the

586
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,490
question and then you would respond to

587
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,279
it but then somebody else would raise

588
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,410
their hand and say oh you're looking for

589
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,740
this input I know where it is man and

590
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:49,440
and so they would share and and so that

591
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:52,740
these these conferences create a like a

592
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,929
hub for information not only are the

593
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,880
speakers like downloading this

594
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:59,759
information and teaching but also

595
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,580
there's cross-pollination as well and

596
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,619
and there's tons of new like friendships

597
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:06,779
made people exchanging phone numbers and

598
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:10,769
email addresses and and planning to get

599
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:12,509
together later to you know to talk and

600
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:14,460
actually the number one thing I think

601
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:16,349
came up last year was people continually

602
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,819
wanting to get together with their local

603
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:20,459
people and start talking about

604
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:22,379
developing cultivars that were only

605
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,240
gonna be from their part of the country

606
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,480
and then control the genetics because

607
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,669
you know once interstate commerce is

608
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,548
allowed it's gonna be California versus

609
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:35,520
everybody and so for anybody who's not

610
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:37,710
California um now is the time to

611
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,500
developing cultivars that you're gonna

612
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,630
keep the genetics where you live but

613
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,808
people will develop a taste for that

614
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:49,140
particular cultivar and and come to you

615
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:52,950
for it so so there's that I know I

616
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:55,200
shan't go in there the Portland Maine

617
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,779
they was so what you're talking about

618
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,490
was so evident they the excitement of

619
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:04,558
this is my tribe here we have community

620
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:07,019
for them it was Meleager ization was

621
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:11,099
much more I don't know if it happened

622
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:13,230
that year or just the year before but it

623
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:16,259
was it was like for for many of them and

624
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:19,230
some of these people were veterans you

625
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:22,140
know the guys that have been doing this

626
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:25,829
for 40 years and were there with seeds

627
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,720
and knowledge to share and technique and

628
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:30,779
and things and it was the first time

629
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:34,200
they'd come together in an open forum in

630
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:36,329
a in a community spot and that was

631
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,460
really exciting the the kind of buzz

632
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:40,259
about that of like man this is kind of

633
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,798
surreal I've never done this before or

634
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:46,079
sitting down and you know this is okay

635
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:47,759
so that was that was that was a lot of

636
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,980
fun to watch and and to listen to the

637
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:53,009
stories and to meet some of these people

638
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,690
who have kind of had to play be under

639
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:59,250
the radar and nobody knows who they are

640
00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:01,890
and come to find out they're you know

641
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,869
they've been doing this well for a long

642
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,120
time and they have lots to share so as

643
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:08,038
much as their speakers that are you know

644
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:11,219
valuable for their information there's

645
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:13,288
also this community that I think for a

646
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,870
lot of farmers ends up being as valuable

647
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:17,759
because of the knowledge drop I agree

648
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:19,408
with that and while we're at it the

649
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,480
seeds as well right because part of

650
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:23,970
every conference is the seed swap and

651
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,370
you know probably everybody who's

652
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:30,329
watching is like in deceits right and

653
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:32,219
and so it's a great opportunity to to

654
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:35,970
meet people who are who are producing

655
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,069
seeds in your area and so they're there

656
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,950
developing cultivars that are good for

657
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:43,528
where you live and just like I am oh you

658
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,929
want microbes that are local growing

659
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:48,000
plants that are developed locally as you

660
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:51,000
way ahead cuz like rancid there's

661
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,128
there's one in humble but there's you

662
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,200
know Michigan and Maine are not in

663
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:58,349
humble and most of the country is not an

664
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,740
humble and so for for many of us growing

665
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:03,959
seeds from Northern California with you

666
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,490
know nine ten week finishes are not

667
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,798
necessarily for everybody in the rest of

668
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,269
the country there's a reason why the

669
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:11,429
football area is the heartland of

670
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:13,649
American heritage cannabis right because

671
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,179
the growing is so great there but but if

672
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:17,250
you live in Portland Maine or in

673
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,929
Michigan or or even though nothing's

674
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,079
happening here on Vashon Island even

675
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:24,360
where I live in the Pacific Northwest

676
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:27,058
you know getting seeds made by your

677
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:30,269
neighbors that are proven to work in

678
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:33,408
your outside conditions and and plants

679
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:36,929
that like to eat the eggs ooh dates of

680
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:40,649
or like to give out the exudates at your

681
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:43,740
local microbes enjoy it's a real leg up

682
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:45,928
and that's fun because you know you get

683
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,609
you get cool stuff and you're extras

684
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:49,889
right that don't necessarily have all

685
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:51,778
that much value do you are super Billy

686
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:54,079
Boyd rare to somebody else so the seed

687
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:58,200
swap is cool and it's exciting to watch

688
00:32:54,079 --> 00:33:00,509
Wendy you know I mean I didn't bring any

689
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,700
seed the bringing macadamia nut seeds to

690
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:04,649
cannabis conferences and you know it's

691
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,389
it just didn't seem as important maybe

692
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:09,199
I'll bring some this year and people can

693
00:33:06,388 --> 00:33:13,019
plan the tree in their greenhouse but

694
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,610
just watching the excitement as you know

695
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:18,659
I just sat next to one person but

696
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:20,398
watching as she had her her seeds you

697
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:22,230
know that she was so happy to share

698
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,028
because you have these extras you're

699
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:26,490
never gonna use them but you don't want

700
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:29,220
to throw them away and the excitement

701
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,378
that people were like I get to you know

702
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,159
have and she's telling the stories about

703
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:37,079
each cultivar and and yeah that was that

704
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,769
was pretty fun to watch that was for me

705
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:42,538
as far as the conference's go that that

706
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:45,329
was the excitement for me in Portland

707
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:48,058
just watching basically it was like you

708
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:49,679
know my kids walking into a taffy store

709
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:51,869
where they got all those barrels and

710
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,630
the different colors you know it was it

711
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:56,549
was above that level of excitement so

712
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:00,510
yeah definitely bring something to share

713
00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:03,029
and look forward meeting some wonderful

714
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:05,670
people with their extras as well one of

715
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:08,820
the things that I was told to me so

716
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:10,470
somebody asked me to to trade some CBD

717
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,059
seeds there was a woman and we were

718
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:14,159
chatting and it was in you know they was

719
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:15,750
tore towards the end and she said to me

720
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,389
she says you know this is all great and

721
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,829
I like regenerative agriculture she says

722
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,539
but honestly the best thing about this

723
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:24,179
conference was for her to meet other

724
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:26,610
women because there are more you know

725
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,919
the percentage of women growers and

726
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,110
reject the regenerative part of cannabis

727
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,450
is larger than the rest right there's a

728
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:36,329
lot of a lot of bros and bro science but

729
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,309
the the regenerative living soil caring

730
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:41,069
from you know rhizosphere and the

731
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:43,710
microbes it's a the percentage of women

732
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:47,280
in growing this way is much higher and

733
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:49,470
so so for for women wanting to connect

734
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,030
with other women that's also a really

735
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:52,889
great thing because this this brings

736
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:56,010
folks out where they can learn it up in

737
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:58,799
a safe atmosphere full of good folks so

738
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:01,650
that's pretty great yeah the you know

739
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,019
traveling around the world and going to

740
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:07,740
go into farms in Southeast Asia and and

741
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:11,239
all these places in the US we really

742
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:14,909
need that to increase some of the best

743
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:18,559
farmers internationally are women and

744
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:24,170
and in a lot of cultures and nations

745
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:26,549
primarily women and yeah I think I

746
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:30,329
couldn't I couldn't tell you why but I

747
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:35,760
think for a lot of reasons there there's

748
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:38,130
a strength or inherent talent that

749
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,920
actually makes them better and caring

750
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:45,900
for for a plant and yeah so you know not

751
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,389
not not knocking the guy farmers out

752
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:52,680
there but but I think there's something

753
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:56,489
to be said for really fostering that as

754
00:35:52,679 --> 00:36:00,139
we grow in culture and and look at what

755
00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:02,279
the future is for Isis farmers in the US

756
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:03,329
and I guess the last thing that I would

757
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,269
mention it as far

758
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:08,369
the vibe of the event is that while

759
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:10,949
there are certainly while there's

760
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:12,719
certainly very intense information and a

761
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:14,189
high level and lots of people are taking

762
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:17,459
notes there's lots of people writing

763
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:20,070
everything down it's also very festive

764
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,409
by it's a it's a gathering of people

765
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:25,680
they're happy to be there the smoke

766
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:27,139
breaks are awesome you know now the kind

767
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,460
everybody's bring in there they're a

768
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:33,119
grade-two you know to share with each

769
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:35,699
other and check out and and and so it's

770
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,789
a nice balance of let's let's get really

771
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:41,480
focused and and learn and but then also

772
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:44,880
let's let's enjoy each other's company

773
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,800
and all around it's a great thing so

774
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,550
yeah like you said earlier well worth

775
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:54,539
the money and and also when you think

776
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:56,850
about the increased quality of product

777
00:36:54,539 --> 00:37:00,360
you're gonna put out and the increased

778
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:02,549
value it has both for your own health

779
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,500
and to share with your friends when you

780
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,510
can say you're implementing KNF

781
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,730
techniques which is the cutting edge of

782
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,440
healthy cannabis it's it's it's good

783
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,449
with your legal processor it's good if

784
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,269
you're a patient processor wherever you

785
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:18,019
are along the game the the future is not

786
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:19,949
in a bottle the future is about

787
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:23,610
wildcrafting and taking care of your

788
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:25,919
plants as nature intended and you know

789
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,809
when you show up to the courses you're

790
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,000
you've chosen to be on the cutting edge

791
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:32,670
and embrace that so you know invest a

792
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,429
little in yourself and come out and join

793
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:38,130
us um you know yeah Shango so I I saw a

794
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:41,099
question just popped up here from

795
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:43,200
laughing shaman and I thought it might

796
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:47,909
be a good time what is this event we're

797
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:49,739
talking about oh well the best part is I

798
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:51,389
can answer that question the hardest

799
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:55,159
part is that I don't think I've gotten

800
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:55,159
the name of the event correct

801
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:05,369
the science of regenerative cannabis

802
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,080
cultivation conference it's a mouthful

803
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:09,449
and people are calling it the regen

804
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,980
conference and that's that's what I've

805
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:12,929
been calling it for two years and so I

806
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,710
never could never actually learn all

807
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:16,019
name right

808
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,710
so the regen conference is a it's a

809
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:19,380
serious

810
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,900
traveling conference there's three

811
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:25,349
locations left Humboldt County is coming

812
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:29,039
up soon and then after that is I think

813
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:33,390
humbled is like the 20 the 30th or the

814
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:35,909
31st to the 2nd of February January 2020

815
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:39,598
yeah and then and then and then after

816
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:42,179
that it goes to Michigan just outside of

817
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,430
Ann Arbor and then and then the last one

818
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:46,230
is in Portland Maine and the idea behind

819
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:50,190
the conference those are both in March I

820
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:52,679
think correct and so and so the

821
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:56,039
conference itself in theme is traveling

822
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:59,429
and the same speakers more or less will

823
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:00,838
be at the different locations of course

824
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:03,838
the attendees will be different and the

825
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,400
questions will be different and if the

826
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:09,858
idea is to pull together the entire

827
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,858
regenerative agriculture community and

828
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:18,920
so that everybody can up their game and

829
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:22,769
so the website will be listed below and

830
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:25,588
and and you can get buy tickets there

831
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:27,150
there for sale now and not to be missed

832
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:28,889
because there's a there's a limited

833
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,230
number of tickets available for every

834
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:33,539
location so this is you don't want to

835
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,190
sleep on this you don't want to go to

836
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:36,779
the point that we're selling out again

837
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,760
this year because there won't be tickets

838
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,500
sold at the door so you got to get them

839
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,260
in advance and you want to get them

840
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,608
before they're sold out Chris Chris do
