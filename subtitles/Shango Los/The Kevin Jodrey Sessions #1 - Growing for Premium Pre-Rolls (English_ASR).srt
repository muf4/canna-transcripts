1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,679
hey this is Shango from shaping fire a

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,240
couple weeks ago I sat down with Kevin

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:07,830
Joe jury and asked him a whole bunch of

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,359
questions that I really wanted to know

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,699
his opinion on but nobody else seemed to

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,619
be asking him so this is first in a

7
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,469
series that you're gonna get you know

8
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,939
over the next couple weeks and they

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,549
cover the topics couldn't you know cover

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,250
everything from growing specifically for

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,560
pre-rolls to choosing the quality of

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,570
terpenes to use in manufacturing your

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,518
cannabis products all the way through to

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,320
like you know snitching you know what's

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,619
going on with snitching in California

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,020
and even even his mom on his Facebook

17
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,189
page and what's up with that so anyway

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,340
it's gonna be a good series this is

19
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,808
number one here we go so Kevin you know

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,510
when you were up speaking on Vashon

21
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,530
Island you said this great thing in your

22
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,719
lecture and I wanted to give you a

23
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,149
chance to break it out a little bit you

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
said that there are is a particular way

25
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,198
to grow for pre-rolls

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,480
right and you know pre-rolls have taken

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,009
off but but you were very clear that

28
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,419
there are there are types of strains

29
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,698
that what you want to use for pre-rolls

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,140
and definitely ones that you do not so I

31
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,090
want to give you an opportunity to break

32
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,739
that out about how to choose your

33
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,320
strains if they're gonna end up in

34
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:13,829
pre-rolls pre-rolls

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:16,019
are a unique type of cannabis delivery

36
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,030
system because you've taken the flowers

37
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:19,859
and you ground them and so you've

38
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,689
oxidized them you've exposed them to

39
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,890
oxygen which starts to break them down

40
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:29,339
and because they're typically consumed

41
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,700
in that smokeable form you end up having

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,700
a long cylinder of smoking material and

43
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,250
so cannabis that has a high monoterpene

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,009
very loosely molecularly bonded scent

45
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,319
molecules they're outstanding for flower

46
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,969
sales and for oil sales because the nose

47
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,798
can pick it up but you should look they

48
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,500
don't pick up those smells through the

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,090
Rowland paper and they're also very

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,040
temperature sensitive and and the

51
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,350
process of handling grinding exposing

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,759
the air diminishes right and so for

53
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,839
pre-rolls what you really want to seek

54
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,700
as a sesquiterpene dominant strain

55
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,469
and one can even take a look down with

56
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,000
all the trip reports and find out which

57
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,228
varietals have these high sesqui

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,090
terpenes and when you're doing

59
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:09,758
sifting say through a line so say we're

60
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,259
sifting through a Lemon Haze line we

61
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,549
would go through the lemon haze line and

62
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:14,229
we would look to see which one's of

63
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,000
these phenotypes that were selecting our

64
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:18,939
cultivars we're trying to select have a

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,739
higher sesquiterpene signature because

66
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:23,560
what that does is it has a much higher

67
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:25,930
heat resistance in its resiliency to

68
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,150
stay active and so as you start to

69
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,680
consume the pre-roll the flavor in the

70
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,230
front of the joint when you smoke it

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,330
should be very close to the same at the

72
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:35,979
back of the joint and with a lot of the

73
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,930
pre-roll of products is we get a hit

74
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:40,539
that tastes okay and then it's just

75
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,760
smoking and the problem is that it gives

76
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:45,098
pre-rolls a bad name and for people who

77
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,289
like to smoke joints they are typically

78
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,609
rolling a flower fresh meaning they're

79
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:50,709
breaking it up themselves they're

80
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,090
preparing it so they get everything in

81
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,379
this beautiful package and when they buy

82
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,289
something pre-prepared

83
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:58,479
its diminished and for me it's a lot

84
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:00,699
simpler to just find the right varietals

85
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,259
that have a higher sesquiterpene and a

86
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:04,000
good example would be the met the old

87
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:06,699
Mendel perps the Urkel the Barney all

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,129
those perps that was so resilient and

89
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:11,199
they were so popular because blunts at

90
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:14,169
that time was such a in vogue form of

91
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,548
smoking and you have this large cylinder

92
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,949
of cannabis that you're burning so

93
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:20,590
there's really a lot of heat the men

94
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:22,358
doper the herbal had an ability to hold

95
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,759
the flavor all the way to the bitter end

96
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:27,459
and so it allowed people to enjoy the

97
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,138
experience the entire time and when we

98
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,459
started to really look at pre rolls and

99
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:31,989
that's how the market accepts that I

100
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,789
realized that that's where we had to

101
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:35,200
focus and so if you're going to go do

102
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:37,479
pre rolls and you're trying to get into

103
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,578
that distribution you might find that

104
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,979
the varieties you sold as flower aren't

105
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:43,480
necessarily best for pre-roll and you

106
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:44,619
have to kind of Reese if your population

107
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,169
and then you

108
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,580
Turpin Alice's to give you an idea which

109
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,049
ones really have a much higher level

110
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,780
assessment syrup beans heavily more

111
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,640
bonded it's it's clear that you know in

112
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,979
the early days especially medical people

113
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,409
would use their their B and C stuff and

114
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:00,759
put those in the pre rolls because you

115
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,680
know they were gonna be chewed up and no

116
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,719
one would see them but now with so many

117
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,549
more people involved the the pre roll

118
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,259
game has gotten a lot better and it

119
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:10,360
makes a lot more sense to put you know

120
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:12,429
maybe not your super bag appeal a but at

121
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,310
least you're a - stuff that's got sesqui

122
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,750
terpenes in it so people can even taste

123
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,030
it you know tasting it down to the roach

124
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,350
is a rare thing well well it also opens

125
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,659
up another market of things that aren't

126
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,070
necessarily visually attractive and so

127
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,710
flower market has to be beautiful

128
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:28,540
because people see it but once you grind

129
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:30,699
it and turn it into a product no one has

130
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,229
any idea what it is and so therefore it

131
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,240
allows you to pick different varietals

132
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,649
that really would shine in a pre-roll

133
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,090
environment where you get a lot of

134
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:39,638
quantity the flower it has a high

135
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:43,000
sesquiterpene component it's not bag

136
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,038
appeal a plus but who cares so it allows

137
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,168
you to have some choices to work with on

138
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:48,579
your farm so you have more of a

139
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:49,990
distribution and I think that what

140
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,569
really happened too is the consumer got

141
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,400
educated and so back in the day you got

142
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:56,399
whatever you could turn that off

143
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:06,050
[Music]

144
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,759
it has the right idea though because it

145
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:22,040
got hot in here fast as soon as it

146
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:27,069
closed the doors the regulatory gauntlet

147
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:30,500
for a while so we get back to the topic

148
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:32,540
the customer became educated and so back

149
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,310
in the day you received cannabis it was

150
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,660
from wherever it was from then you

151
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,949
received cannabis from your street

152
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,990
dealer and it was what they could grab

153
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,000
and then you got into the rise of

154
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,110
dispensaries where you had an incredible

155
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,689
amount of cannabis being grown

156
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,860
everywhere constantly being brought into

157
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,300
these storefronts that allowed

158
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,220
tremendous numbers of people to buy

159
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,009
cannabis on a normal consistent level

160
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,140
but they could examine and an educated

161
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,629
them so you can't dump your low-end

162
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,399
cannabis into pre-rolls anymore just as

163
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,050
you can't dump any low in cannabis into

164
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,409
concentrates because people have an

165
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,290
expectation of flavor profile so it

166
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,180
doesn't work to dump quality products

167
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,160
that should be in a bag into a pre-roll

168
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,780
and it doesn't make sense to take stuff

169
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,939
that should be in a pre-roll into a bag

170
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,409
and so once you see that it allows you

171
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,420
to differentiate what you're working

172
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,760
with on the farm and things that don't

173
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,120
require the visual Beauty are a lot less

174
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,949
labor-intensive and so it gives you some

175
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,420
options in terms of profitability I

176
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,439
think well cool thanks for breaking that

177
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,439
out know where it's right up
