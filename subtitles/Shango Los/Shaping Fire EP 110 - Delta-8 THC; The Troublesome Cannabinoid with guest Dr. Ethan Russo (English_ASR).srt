there are over 100 cannabinoids found in

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,320
cannabis and more continue to be

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,400
discovered each one has a personality

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,160
each has particular uses and when they

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,359
all work together they are at their best

Federal canabo prohibition influences

00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,960
the Cannabis Market in ways that pervert

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,199
it to the detriment of everybody even

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,240
though Delta 8 THC is widespread

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,560
throughout the country and many profess

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:34,199
that it was made by the US farm bill it

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,159
is not actually a legal canabo its

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,399
illegality is just not enforced but

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,319
that's not what we're covering during

00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,878
the molecular nature of Delta 8 THC and

94

set we will learn about how Delta 8 is

96
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,799
synthesized and how that creates

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,039
complications for use of this

98
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,438
cannabinoid and during the third set we

99
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,280
will explore some of the Lesser

discussed attributes of Delta 8

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,840

syndrome welcome back to shaping fire

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,319
Ethan that's nice to be here you know I

105
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,879
had another first this morning while

106
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:02,119
setting up here in my office Studio of

107
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,518
usually I can leave a window cracked

108
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,079
facing the water for you know the good

109
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,840
saltwater smells but today I had to

110
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,040
close it because the sea lions have

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,560
decided to have a party on the beach

112
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:17,159
below my house and you know you can just

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,358
hear them honking away and um I did a

114
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,959
little test and uh you could actually

115
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,560
hear them and I thought well that would

116
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,360
that would give people a little bit of

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,600
sense of place but but also probably not

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,919
appropriate and and this isn't the first

119
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,680
time that animals have played a role one

120
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,000
of your shaping fire episodes you may

121
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,800
recall that 5 years ago I we were

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,319
recording and I had to ask you to hold

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,000
for a moment because my neighbors cows

124
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:46,439
had found their way into my yard and

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,279
were eating um all of uh my my tulips

126
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,000
and so you were kind to wait for a

127
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,000
minute while I shoed them out of the

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,639
yard yeah the animals uh want their

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,560
voices heard totally and and this

130
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,280
Island's definitely theirs as as much of

131
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,560
or maybe even more than ours so anyway

132
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,839
so um thank you for being here Ethan and

133
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,759
U let's get started right off at the top

134
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:10,799
you know so many people refer to uh

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,639
Delta 8 tetrahydro canabidol as you know

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,840
d8 Delta 8 everybody wants to shorten it

137
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,519
and everyone just kind of like assumes

138
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,119
they you know other people know what it

139
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,279
is but but since this is a this is a

140
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,519
good uh you know primer on what's going

141
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,679
on with Delta 8 in the Canabis scine I

142
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,079
think we should start there so would you

143
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,560
please describe what Delta 8 is

144
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,719
chemically

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,038
sure so this is a normal

146
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,919
Trace uh compound found in cannabis it

147
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:45,639
differs from the more expected Delta 9

148
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:48,918
THC only in the fact that a double bond

149
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,560
in one of the Rings is in a different

150
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,839
position um

151
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,639
interestingly apparently the plant

152
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:00,038
doesn't have any enzymes to make this

153
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,160
but it appears in Trace Amounts even in

154
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:03,560
fresh

155
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,960
material um and certainly under the

156
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,759
influence of heat uh it may uh appear in

157
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,879
Greater concentrations so it is a

158
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,840
natural

159
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:20,719
component uh and it is more stable to

160
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:24,399
heat than Delta 9 is so that that that

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,520
one caveat confuses me because if if if

162
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,959
the plant doesn't have a way to make it

163
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:35,359
are you suggesting that

164
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:37,959
a um there is enough heat that is that

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,080
happens during harvesting that some

166
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:44,359
amount of canabo is is uh synthesized

167
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,359
into delta8 or are you saying that we

168
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,639
just haven't figured out yet how the

169
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,319
plant makes Delta 8 because if it's

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,000
there it's there yeah I think it's the

171
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,080
ladder uh I'm not sure how it's doing it

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,399
but plants are very resourceful and it

173
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:03,000
may have some trick that doesn't in

174
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,000
evolve uh the customary enzymes right on

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,519
all right well that that's really

176
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,399
interesting it's always great when there

177
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,000
are uh when we get to point out new

178
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,799
research that's uh looking to be done

179
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,839
for all the folks moving into the

180
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,598
industry you know so um so Delta 9 is

181
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,799
the form of THC that you know we're so

182
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:25,000
familiar with and and humans love so

183
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,918
much how is delta 8 different from Delta

184
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,038
9

185
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:33,478
chemically uh again you know if we look

186
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:36,439
at the molecular weight it's the same uh

187
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:40,478
in terms of most reactions uh it's going

188
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:43,639
to be the same it does differ in its

189
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:47,199
Affinity uh for the CB1 receptor the

190
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:50,680
psychoactive receptor and the brain and

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,960
so it is not quite as potent but

192
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,199
basically most of its activity would be

193
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:02,399
similar rather than distinct from Delta

194
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:05,120
9 UM um and there's a very involved

195
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,478
experiment going on now hasn't quite

196
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,800
been completed by Ryan vandre at Johns

197
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,000
Hopkins we have some preliminary results

198
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,439
on it but they haven't gotten through

199
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,079
the full contingent of um subjects for

200
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,879
that study so we will learn more but

201
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,240
they're more similarities than

202
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,280
differences that really surprises me

203
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,000
because um you know most people that I

204
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,478
have spoken with say that you know

205
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,479
they'll they'll they'll struggle to

206
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:36,240
describe what Delta 8 feels like to them

207
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,120
but they're always describing it as uh

208
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,399
feeling different than Delta 9 which we

209
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,480
will often you know we will describe as

210
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,799
a euphoric right and and and so um and

211
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,200
it sounds like we'll get more to the

212
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:52,519
bottom of this after this new study but

213
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,720
but in its Essence are you saying that

214
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:59,159
that we're finding that Delta 8 actually

215
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,240
feels pretty similar to Delta 9 except

216
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:05,360
cep that it's more like at a 60%

217
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,200
potency uh that would be a a really

218
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,839
reasonable way to characterize it yes

219
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:17,600
all right um that surprises me right um

220
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:21,560
so um so it may have a a a reduced but

221
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,000
similar euphoric effect as Delta 9 does

222
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:27,399
um let's talk a bit about the similar

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,759
medical applications you know not only

224
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:36,200
do we love the experience of of taking

225
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:38,838
in Delta 9 THC but but it also has got L

226
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,560
heralded medical benefits of being an

227
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,480
anti-inflammatory and an analgesic and

228
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,759
and an animedic meaning you know anti

229
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,920
nausea along with a whole bunch of other

230
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:54,360
things um does Delta 8 have any of those

231
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:57,519
similar medical applications or or maybe

232
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,959
we don't know yet quite likely but again

233
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,278
there could be differences there's only

234
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:06,399
been one uh real clinical study uh Del

235
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,559
done with Delta 8 and that was cleared

236
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,440
back in

237
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,679
1995 uh so this is a study by Abraham

238
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,160
off and

239
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:20,679
mulam uh they use pure delta8 THC so not

240
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,199
what people commonly have access to here

241
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,958
uh we should say they use this in

242
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,600
relatively high doses to uh children

243
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:34,278
that had uh blood cancers you know

244
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,920
mainly leukemia and the like um and this

245
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,480
was given to counteract nause and

246
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:41,159
vomiting associated with the

247
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
chemotherapy that they were getting and

248
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:46,000
there were

249
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,278
480 total applications uh

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
administrations of this and it was

251
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:52,480
almost

252
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,240
uniformly effective in allaying the

253
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,120
naian vomiting the other thing that was

254
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,519
interesting was uh they seem to tolerate

255
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,879
very high doses compared to that that

256
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,000
would have been used in adults but that

257
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,240
um just highlights something that was

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,278
known say in the 19th century that uh

259
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,799
young children seem to be resistant to

260
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,320
the psychoactive effects of

261
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:21,759
cannabis um wow that's interesting it

262
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:26,320
sure is um explanatory a bit around how

263
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:29,879
we see um young children use THC

264
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,920
cannabis oil without um

265
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,958
you

266
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:37,679
know getting like really stoned you know

267
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:41,439
so many of of the the younger kids can

268
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,559
get relief from their symptoms without

269
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
the accompanying intoxication and I've

270
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,879
always wondered about that do we have

271
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,839
any explanation for why kids uh seem to

272
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:55,320
be able to to tolerate um that aspect of

273
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,760
it sure well the tongue and cheek

274
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,920
explanation would be that kids act like

275
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,439
they're stoned anyway

276
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,319
um but the more serious explanation

277
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,040
would probably have to do with the

278
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,040
density of CB1 receptors in the

279
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,559
brain and and what meaning that they

280
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:14,399
don't have them developed yet and so

281
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,399
they're not they're not taking it on

282
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,000
board as fast is is that the point right

283
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,919
so they're they're not as expressed as

284
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,240
say in in an older person an adolescent

285
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:32,759
or adult right on um so back to the idea

286
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:36,000
that um Dr mulam L were um using um a

287
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,679
large amount of Delta 8 isolate um which

288
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,198
you're right um you know we don't have

289
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,559
easy access to here right now um for

290
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:45,078
lots of reasons that we'll talk about

291
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,000
more later but this is normally when you

292
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:49,120
know you you've been on shaping fire

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,320
before to talk about other novel

294
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,278
cannabinoids and this is normally when I

295
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:59,040
say well you know if the isolate is good

296
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:01,958
does this canabo work more effectively

297
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,719
in a uh in a whole plant preparation

298
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:07,239
instead of an isolate but you've already

299
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:13,040
said that it's there's only Trace

300
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:16,079
Amounts of it um is there any um is

301
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:20,198
there any analysis to support that that

302
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:23,719
Delta 8's presence or not in such small

303
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:26,240
amounts in a whole plant preparation has

304
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,079
any meaning at all any any substanti of

305
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,480
impact uh the answer is probably not and

306
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:33,879
it was uh

307
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,440
addressed uh quite well by a study

308
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:40,639
that's Now 50 years old uh carneal and

309
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,600
Carini in Brazil back in

310
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:48,079
1973 actually did comparative studies in

311
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,800
man uh also in animals comparing Delta 8

312
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:54,439
and Delta 9

313
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:58,958
THC um and um you know these are very

314
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,920
carefully done studies that uh answer

315
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:07,078
some of those questions but

316
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:10,240
um because Delta 8 proved to be half as

317
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:15,399
effective as Delta 9 in causing rapid

318
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:19,240
heart rate Tac cardia um it also Delta 8

319
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:22,039
was 30% less effective in producing

320
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:27,480
impairment a Time

321
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:30,599
estimation um and it uh was had less

322
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,320
psychoactive value according to people's

323
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,040
uh subjective scores you know how they

324
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,120
rated their

325
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,399
psychoactivity so their conclusion was

326
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,519
because of uh the low

327
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,879
concentration of Delta 8 in natural

328
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,919
cannabis that it probably had very

329
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:53,159
little effect uh would be swamped by the

330
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,719
higher amounts of Delta 9 and I should

331
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,759
add at this time that we have no

332
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,639
indication that we could selectively

333
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:05,879
breed for higher T Delta a THC

334
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,839
concentrations um so you know I had

335
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,000
heard that before but earlier in the

336
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,800
show already you had mentioned that we

337
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,440
actually don't know how Delta 8 even

338
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:20,719
comes into being in the plant so um what

339
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,079
is the the early signs that were getting

340
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,879
this idea that it would be difficult or

341
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:29,599
unlikely that we could um selectively

342
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:33,639
breed for increased Delta 8

343
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,800
um well again because there seemingly

344
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:39,519
are no enzymes that would make it um and

345
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,879
uh there's been a lot of cannabis

346
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,720
breeding going on and nothing has

347
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,958
appeared that seems to have

348
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,839
significantly more Delta eight

349
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,719
concentration so we we just don't have a

350
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,120
path forward for

351
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,959
that all right and I you know it's

352
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,120
unclear to me that it would be worth the

353
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,359
expenditure of time money and effort

354
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,159
either oh sure well whether or not it

355
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,318
makes sense from a a market point of

356
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,159
view is definitely true but also a

357
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:09,599
different thing because you know when

358
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,958
you and I are here saying that um you

359
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,120
know there's no way to selectively breed

360
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,479
for increased delta8 that you know if I

361
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,120
was a breeder and hearing that that

362
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,920
sounds like a dare you know and um and

363
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,198
if there is some you know established uh

364
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:27,360
Botanical reason you know why we see a

365
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,039
you know a blockage in that path for

366
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,159
breeding I figured this would be a good

367
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:35,439
time to bring it

368
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:36,759
up sure um so um and I also think that

369
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,959
now is probably a good time to say we're

370
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,839
going to talk more about this later but

371
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,719
but I can imagine listeners asking the

372
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,120
question to themselves well then where

373
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,480
the hell does all this Delta 8 come from

374
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,198
and um and spoiler alert we're going to

375
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,480
tell you during the second set um that

376
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:57,679
it nowadays it is a almost entirely

377
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,920
synthesized from CBD can have a dial so

378
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,758
we'll answer that question question now

379
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:05,399
but we'll get into that more during the

380
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:08,599
second set so so Ethan if if U if Delta

381
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,199
8 is less potent than Delta 9 and the

382
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,639
high is not as delightful and the

383
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,160
medicinal benefit isn't as

384
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,120
substantial um it seems to me that there

385
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:23,480
is an obvious Market reason why such an

386
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:26,438
inferior canabo is being used in so many

387
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,919
states in place of Simply using

388
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:32,279
traditional Delta 9 cannabis

389
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:35,640
um what is that reason well first I I'm

390
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,720
not sure I'd use the word inferior um it

391
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,919
is inferior from the standpoint of

392
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:45,120
quality control um and really the issue

393
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,600
with delta8 is that it is

394
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:52,439
synthesized uh that the uh material

395
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:56,000
that's produced is not pure uh that

396
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,558
there can be all these byproducts about

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,079
which we know very little in terms of

398
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:05,519
their activity or safety and the

399
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:08,639
possibility of residual solvents so the

400
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:12,519
answer is because people make money

401
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,960
doing it and uh because of the these

402
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,558
interpretations of the law in some

403
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,798
instances that Delta 8 is

404
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:27,639
legal um people have been taking excess

405
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:32,200
CBD and turning it into Delta 8 um as a

406
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,038
way to use it and make money with it um

407
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,440
basically in some instances because

408
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:41,240
there have been 3% Delta 9 restrictions

409
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,519
on

410
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,480
concentration uh people have tried to

411
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:50,558
get around that by spiking things with

412
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:54,079
Delta a of synthetic origin um so it's a

413
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:56,158
market issue uh that is based on what

414
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:01,519
I'm going to say is a misconception of

415
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:03,919
the available law and and one way or

416
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,279
another we can parse out the law but

417
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,799
more importantly the the answer seems to

418
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:13,119
me to be just straight up prohibition

419
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:16,720
that that that if um we had uh federally

420
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:19,519
legalized you know cannabis that the the

421
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,279
the market for Delta 8 would

422
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:26,679
instantaneously disappear except for the

423
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:30,000
small group of cannabis patients who who

424
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:33,080
have uh unique issues that Delta 8 uh

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
can address like the um the the children

426
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,839
during uh chemotherapy that you

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,880
mentioned earlier and and I think that's

428
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:44,158
important to point out because um you

429
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,360
know we will be talking today about a

430
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:50,919
lot of the challenges to using Delta 8

431
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:54,959
in in the market as it presently you

432
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:57,919
know functions today but but these

433
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,720
questions are only um happening and

434
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,240
people who are uh incorporating Delta 8

435
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,798
into their products none of this would

436
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,960
be happening if it weren't for federal

437
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,879
um prohibition of the preferred sibling

438
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,880
Delta 9 would you agree with that uh yes

439
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:21,200
let me State this clearly the current

440
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:23,400
craze about Delta ATHC is a byproduct of

441
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,319
prohibition excellent it doesn't get any

442
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:30,480
clearer than that um all right so um so

443
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:33,279
that brings us to um wanting to

444
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,120
understand a bit about how we got here

445
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:40,200
and so um uh I was uh fortunate to uh

446
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:43,558
catch your uh webinar a couple weeks ago

447
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,440
um about uh the history of Delta 8 and

448
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,599
its uses and um you you've you've got

449
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,798
the the historical milestones for Delta

450
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,439
8 in a really nice like tight package

451
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:56,038
now so um I I think what I'd like to do

452
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,480
at this point um would just be like to

453
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,798
hand you the mic and just let you go for

454
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,480
a while and and please just teach us

455
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,679
about the historical Milestones to

456
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,240
delta8 that bring us to where we are now

457
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,080
sure well we have to go way back to the

458
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,720
fourth Century on what was then

459
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:19,359
Palestine um there was a skeleton that

460
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,038
was found in a cave in bemes uh which is

461
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:25,479
about midway between Tel Aviv and

462
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:28,158
Jerusalem um in this cave there was the

463
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,360
skeleton of what appeared to be a 14y

464
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:36,440
year old uh young woman who apparently

465
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:39,079
died in childbirth um in her pelvis was

466
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,759
an undelivered full-term

467
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:45,519
fetus uh next to her there was this

468
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:48,960
carbonized fragment of material that

469
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:51,480
when analyzed showed Delta ATHC now as I

470
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,000
mentioned previously that's more heat

471
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,759
stable than um Delta 9 uh so the fact

472
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,159
that it was there indicates that this

473
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:04,440
was psychoactive material that

474
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:08,720
apparently had been burned and the

475
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,480
um the analysis of the situation was

476
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:16,120
that this cannabis was burned in an

477
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:18,558
effort to Aid delivery of the the baby

478
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:21,119
uh which in this instance didn't work

479
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:24,359
however there's been thousands of years

480
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:27,038
of history of successful use of cannabis

481
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:30,439
for this purpose so that's the first

482
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:33,720
delta8 I know about then we've got to go

483
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,798
clear up to uh about

484
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,919
1942 there was an American scientist

485
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:43,240
named Roger Adams uh who did a lot of

486
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,480
work in analysis and synthesis related

487
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,960
to

488
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,240
canono um actually in 1940 he sort of

489
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,519
almost got the structure of

490
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,960
canaba uh so he had a bunch of this and

491
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,599
synthesized what he called tetrahydro

492
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,919
canabal from it but it wasn't pure there

493
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,959
were at least two

494
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,919
forms what he found out was when

495
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,798
administered to dogs this made them

496
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:12,759
wobbly on their feet what's called

497
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:16,158
Static Axia and then and earlier this

498
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:17,640
was a test for cannabis preparations as

499
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,480
to their

500
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,679
potency he took some of this material

501
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,599
actually 30 milligrams of what likely at

502
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:30,200
this point was Delta ATHC put it in

503
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:35,319
olive oil capsules and then tested these

504
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:38,080
on um convicts in New York 77 of them

505
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:40,839
now this is interesting because I think

506
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:45,199
people will see the similarities of

507
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:48,839
effects to Delta 9 so with the Delta 8

508
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,120
capsules um they got onset orally in 30

509
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,240
to 90 minutes it uh Peak somewhere

510
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:57,359
between 3 and 1 half to 5 hours and was

511
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,519
gone after 7 hours and the effects again

512
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,558
were quite analogous to Delta 9 they had

513
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:04,720
increased heart rate a little bit of

514
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:08,759
increased blood pressure faster

515
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:12,558
breathing their eyes got red um they got

516
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:15,038
dry mouth some got wobbly on their feet

517
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,158
um you know recognizing there was a

518
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:20,440
somewhat higher dose some got anxious

519
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,320
some were euphoric uh they talked a lot

520
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,759
it seemed a lower

521
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,558
inition uh they those who were familiar

522
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:31,240
with the term felt High uh there were

523
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,519
bursts of laughter and some

524
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,079
drowsiness um and then they did

525
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,398
experiments and showed that with

526
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,079
prolonged usage there was tolerance

527
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:43,519
these psychoactive

528
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:46,558
effects um now interestingly they made a

529
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,240
distinction in uh humans between inmates

530
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:51,319
and what they called high- ranking

531
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,759
individuals and industrialists who also

532
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:57,119
tried this but the effects were quite

533
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,240
the same uh so it may show you that

534
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,079
businessmen at a high level aren't that

535
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,640
different than

536
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:07,918
convicts but enough political commentary

537
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,320
um subsequently uh some of the same

538
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,200
material 15 milligrams of what was

539
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:17,398
likely Delta

540
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,840
ATC um was again used on convicts in uh

541
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:21,918
New York um this is part of What's

542
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,278
called the LaGuardia report that came

543
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,240
out in

544
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:31,079
1944 but they Ed this to test uh about

545
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,558
withdrawal from uh narcotics

546
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:37,000
specifically morphine or heroin um and

547
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,319
so they compared this 15 milligrams of

548
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,079
Delta

549
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:45,918
ATC uh to uh what was called mendi

550
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:49,798
solution which was just a a form of

551
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:52,399
morphine um anyway they found that uh

552
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,759
this helped with the withdrawal reduce

553
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:57,678
the symptoms and people were able to

554
00:25:54,759 --> 00:26:00,158
leave the hospital after treatment uh

555
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,480
seemingly in better condition than those

556
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,760
who got no treatment or got the the

557
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,399
morphine

558
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,200
substitute um so they were able to eat

559
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:11,239
on and some actually gained weight

560
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,919
during withdrawal which is not what we

561
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,960
usually expect with

562
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,440
opas um after that we've got to go clear

563
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,200
up to the

564
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,080
1960s uh at this point uh professor

565
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,480
mulim and his colleagues were working

566
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,359
out all the structures of cannabis

567
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,839
components from

568
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:36,240
hashish um and so in 1963 they figured

569
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,678
out the absolute structure of canaba in'

570
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,919
64 uh Delta 9

571
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:45,480
THC uh in '

572
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:48,640
66 um they showed that um you could turn

573
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:52,278
canabidol into Delta

574
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,440
ATHC uh through a chemical reaction um

575
00:26:52,278 --> 00:27:00,038
so two nasty things um heated together

576
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:03,320
with benzene and what's called row toine

577
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:07,599
sulfonic acid and they could make Delta

578
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:11,319
ATHC um that and similar schemes have

579
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:15,918
come down to us uh in the current time

580
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:18,599
uh as a way to make Delta ATC from

581
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,399
CBD and then there were some some more

582
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:25,278
experiments that were done um uh again

583
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:29,678
in ' 66 it was shown that you could find

584
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:34,679
some tiny amounts of Delta at in freshh

585
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:37,038
cannabis um the dean of American

586
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,759
cannabis studies in the 60s and early

587
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:42,158
70s with Leo

588
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:45,558
Hollister um he tested Delta

589
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,720
ATHC 20 and 40 milligram as compared to

590
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:51,678
20 milligrams of Delta 9 interestingly

591
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,720
they put this in chocolate cookies um

592
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,278
but the effects were qualitatively very

593
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,319
similar um Euphoria tranquil

594
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,480
difficulty thinking rapid thoughts

595
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,678
decreased memory the time frame he got

596
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,519
was onsetting 30 to 90 minutes early

597
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:12,880
peaking after 2 and a half to three

598
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:16,599
hours on with residual symptoms up to 5

599
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,360
hours um overall again there seemed to

600
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,480
be a lower

601
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:24,759
psychoactivity head-to-head perhaps

602
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,919
Delta 8 being about 63% of the potency

603
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:29,960
of Delta 99 as I calculated and that

604
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,320
might be in keeping with what people

605
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,798
have said

606
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:36,879
previously um I previously mentioned the

607
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:39,960
study of carneal and Carini in 1973 in

608
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:45,278
Brazil their findings were really quite

609
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:48,919
similar uh to the others um they uh

610
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:52,240
essentially thought it was uh about

611
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:55,759
30% uh less

612
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,240
psychoactive um and uh very careful

613
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:01,720
studies for the time um um so um

614
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,000
compared to what we're doing now uh

615
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,240
they're they're really valid

616
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,079
studies um and after that uh really not

617
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,079
much happened Beyond uh Abraham off and

618
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:16,960
mulam study in

619
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:22,319
1995 clear up until a few years ago when

620
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:26,038
uh suddenly Delta 8 appeared um in great

621
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:29,119
profusion uh as a way to get rid of

622
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:31,319
surplus CBD

623
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:33,439
right on well then um that's actually a

624
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,119
great setup that's where we start set to

625
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,159
so um thank you for that explanation of

626
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,759
those historical milestones and um let's

627
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,360
go ahead and take our break and then

628
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,440
when we come back we'll we'll pick up

629
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,398
right here you are listening to shaping

630
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,278
fire and my guest today is neurologist

631
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,719
and cannabis researcher Dr Ethan Russo

632
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,519
and you know without these advertisers

633
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,278
shaping fire would not happen so please

634
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,319
support them and let them know you heard

635
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:58,119
them on shaping

636
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,079
fire

637
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,839
there are so many seed banks nowadays

638
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,158
that you really have options in who to

639
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,199
choose not only that if you pick the

640
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,640
wrong seed bank you could be in for a

641
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,440
really sketchy ride and that's only one

642
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,120
of the reasons I recommend Gas Lamp

643

cannabis audience with a quality message

738
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,960

739
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,119
people choose to advertise on the

our audience get in contact with you

751
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:46,320
it's pretty simple really advertising

752
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:49,878
does not have to be all whizbang smoke

753
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,519
and mirrors nowadays I find that people

754
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:55,199
prefer just to be spoken to calmly

755
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,398
accurately and with good intentions if

756
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,159
you want to make your own commercial

757
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:01,440
spot well you can do that too during

758
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:03,279
these pandemic days conventions and

759
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,519
cannabis events are pretty poorly

760
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,519
attended but podcast listening is

761
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:10,280

779
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,920
and my guest today is neurologist and

780
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,960
canvas researcher Dr Ethan Russo so

781
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,079
before the break we were bringing us up

782
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,639
uh historically to um what is happening

783
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:09,960
now where most folks or nearly everyone

784
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:13,078
um who is incorporating uh Delta a THC

785
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,559
into their products is doing so from

786
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:19,920
Delta 8 um that has been synthesized

787
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,759
from CBD and a reminder that the reason

788
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,240
why they're not taking it directly from

789
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,680
the cannabis plant is because the

790
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:33,759
amounts are um so low so barely there in

791
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:36,118
Trace forms um that uh for both labor

792
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,800
and financial reasons trying to pull it

793
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,160
out of a great deal of uh plant material

794
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,960
just doesn't make sense um but because

795
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:50,639
you can synthesize uh CBD excuse me you

796
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:54,159
can synthesize delta8 THC from CBD um

797
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:57,400
and we had this huge glut of of CBD on

798
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:59,679
the market um just what 3 years ago now

799
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,639
that the the price of the the the CBD

800
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:05,318
raw bulk material the the bulk plant

801
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:08,480
material was so low that it made sense

802
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:11,639
to pull out uh cheap CBD out of these

803
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:16,039
hemp plants and then go to the lab and

804
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:19,480
synthesize it into Delta 8 THC which um

805
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:22,239
you know even though it's less potent um

806
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,039
uh you know there is a way to cause a

807
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:28,318
high and therefore is a way to make

808
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:30,920
money um so Ethan what I'd like you to

809
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:34,759
explain right now uh it's kind of like a

810
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:37,519
a two-part question um for a lot of us

811
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:42,160
who don't have lab experience the idea

812
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:45,280
of synthesizing Delta H THC from CBD is

813
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:49,039
kind of nothing but words and so if you

814
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,720
could um you know uh you know generally

815
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:54,239
explain what it means to do that in the

816
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:56,039
lab and kind of what that's like um so

817
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,679
we can picture that in our heads what it

818
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:01,159
is to synthesize something um and then

819
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,279
and then the second part which is part

820
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:06,598
of your answer is is that um the the

821
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,720
point of our concern about Delta 8 is

822
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,200
that so many contaminants come along

823
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:13,799
with it from the synthesis process which

824
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:16,039
then gets passed down to Consumer so

825
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,000
this is this is the Crux of the problem

826
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:21,358
and and I'd like you to explain the

827
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,800
synthesis and why there are

828
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,960
contaminants sure yeah I think that's an

829
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:30,039
important question so let's say that we

830
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,519
have a bunch of starting material uh so

831
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:36,480
this would be crystalline CBD that

832
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:39,838
originally came from the plant or even

833
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,838
could be be from a synthetic source so

834
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:44,880
first this would be dissolved in some

835
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:48,358
kind of organic solvent now they often

836
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,280
will use things like hexane which is uh

837
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:53,199
something you'd find in gasoline uh it's

838
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,200
not something you'd want to

839
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:59,679
ingest uh then

840
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:04,399
it's Heat Ed in the presence of an acid

841
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:06,799
and uh that closes a ring on kabid and

842
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:12,039
uh produces Delta

843
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:16,200
ATHC so that sounds fine except um then

844
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:19,318
you've got to get rid of the solvent um

845
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:21,960
presumably with some kind of drying or

846
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:24,239
evaporation technique but there always

847
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,000
could be residuals and uh you know

848
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:31,399
that's a source of toxicity but the real

849
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,239
problem here is this isn't a onetoone

850
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,400
proposition in other words you don't get

851
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:41,479
all all the CBD turned only

852
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,559
into uh Delta ATC rather there are all

853
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,800
these other things now we're going to

854
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:53,679
get into some fancy names here Delta 48

855
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:57,800
ISO THC 9 ethoxy hexa hydroc

856
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:59,919
canaban UM and even performing uh

857
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,599
getting new things that hadn't been

858
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,760
discovered before like ISO tetrahydro

859
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,920
canaba

860
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,960
furan um so these are things about which

861
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,119
we know little or nothing it may be that

862
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,159
some of these

863
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,920
substances are okay it may be that

864
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:21,239
they're not they are potentially toxic

865
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,960
some could be actually more psychoactive

866
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:27,279
than Delta 9

867
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,800
THC um and you know probably get into

868
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,720
some of other nases that have been found

869
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,920
in delta8 products but the bottom line

870
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,439
is

871
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,838
this

872
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:43,318
basically it is extremely unlikely that

873
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:46,679
any commercial product with delta8 in it

874
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:50,960
is going to only have that uh will have

875
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:54,078
these potentially toxic byproducts and

876
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:58,240
potentially toxic solvent

877
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,640
residues um so basically uh if you're

878
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:04,399
using these products it's a crapshoot as

879
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:07,199
to what's really in there and what uh

880
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,480
bad effects they might have either

881
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:14,559
acutely or particularly if taken on a

882
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:18,800
chronic basis in most cases uh product

883
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:21,199
manufacturers who are using Delta 8 um

884
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,240
they you know they they they get a test

885
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,960
done that's that's you know perhaps

886
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,639
needed for their state but one way or

887
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,599
another there's a testing test done at

888
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,639
some point of like what what the the

889
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,680
isolate is that they are they are

890
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:36,118
purchasing or making and it's done and

891
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,799
they're like oh you know it looks good

892
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,760
but isn't isn't the science that to find

893
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,400
any of these contaminants you actually

894
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:46,880
have to be using standards to actually

895
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:53,280
see them and and since there is all of

896
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:57,000
this you know chemical static in the the

897
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,680
isolate that is the resultant that that

898
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,119
many people may actually think they're

899
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:06,519
using an air quotes clean isolate of

900
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:09,240
Delta 8 but the the the the costs are so

901
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:12,559
preventative to to check for all of the

902
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:15,719
toxic items that that that that kind

903
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:18,759
of research is not being done on their

904
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:21,838
products uh very likely not so what you

905
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:25,599
said is quite right um so there is this

906
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:29,480
blip on a a screen uh you know whatever

907
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,480
kind of uh analytical test is being done

908
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:36,159
well that's going to remain unknown

909
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:39,119
unless you have a standard um a pure

910
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:43,159
chemical um that you've used in your

911
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,079
analysis uh that tells you what it is um

912
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:48,279
and for some of these compounds there

913
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,440
aren't any standards so um in the

914
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:54,839
analytical studies that have been done

915
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,720
they figure it out using Advanced uh

916
00:42:54,838 --> 00:43:00,440
instrumentation um and comparison with

917
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:04,000
the literature but you know these are

918
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,519
just not uh necessarily available in

919
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,760
your friendly neighborhood

920
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:13,639
lab um you know I have struggled a bit

921
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:17,079
with this with the idea of delta8 being

922
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:19,598
um natural or a synthetic because

923
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:25,000
synthetic and natural both seem

924
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:28,039
to um be uh inexact words and and you

925
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,760
know I originally learned about uh Delta

926
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:33,480
8 as a synthetic something that is not

927
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,599
naturally occurring but the more I speak

928
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,880
with Scientists um they say what what

929
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:39,119
you have said which is there's there's

930
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,760
such a trace

931
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,680
amount uh that that it does occur in the

932
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,640
applant we're not exactly sure how it

933
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:51,519
occurs in the plant but but it's it's

934
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:56,519
there in Trace Amounts but to to to say

935
00:43:51,519 --> 00:44:00,519
that Delta 8 is then natural seems to be

936
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:04,639
a bit of a misnomer because that's not

937
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:06,599
the delta8 that is used in uh the market

938
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:10,920
what's used for product

939
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:13,318
manufacturing is uh I dare say always

940
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,079
going to be Delta 8 that's been

941
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:19,318
synthesized from canabidol which is

942
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:21,559
synthetic because it's not naturally

943
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:23,480
occurring and so I just wanted to hear

944
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:26,599
whatever your thoughts were on this on

945
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:30,679
these messy use of synthetic versus

946
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:33,680
natural for uh in in in an

947
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:37,879
isolate right well you know to keep it

948
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:41,159
quite simple uh basically any consumer

949
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,640
product uh advertising itself as

950
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:47,799
containing Delta ATC is of synthetic

951
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:50,719
origin and subject to all the caveats

952
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,160
and warnings that we've uh already

953
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:56,399
discussed um and it gets worse from

954
00:44:53,159 --> 00:45:01,118
there um you know some of these products

955
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,280
may contain Delta a CO acetate um

956
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,920
there's a whole problem with this group

957
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,760
of compounds the um

958
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,119
Esters um when these are

959
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,400
vaporized uh they can produce something

960
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:18,440
called ketenes which are toxic to the

961
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:23,000
lungs and have been uh associated with

962
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:26,639
um this uh problem with the lungs called

963
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,119
evali uh which is an acronym for

964
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:32,400
something very ominous uh called

965
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,400
ecigarette or vaping product use

966
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,880
Associated lung injury people may have

967
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:42,119
heard this term in relation to the

968
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,519
vitamin E acetate Scandal of a few years

969
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:49,400
ago where vitamin E acetate was put in

970
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:53,639
Vape pans as sort of a carrier uh it had

971
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,880
a consistency that was sort of like um

972
00:45:53,639 --> 00:46:00,920
uh cannabis concentrate

973
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,000
um and it was put in vape pens but uh

974
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,119
number of people were hospitalized and

975
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,280
there were some deaths due to pulmonary

976
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:11,800
damage uh from this kind of compound and

977
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,640
the same thing could happen with any of

978
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,760
these uh

979
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:22,759
acetates that uh are sometimes seen as

980
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:28,559
toxic byproducts of Delta ATC production

981
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:31,640
so actually um Delta a thco acetate has

982
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,839
been demonstrated on a vape pen

983
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:37,639
something called Blue drain this is

984
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:40,279
showed shown by benowitz at all on an

985
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:45,558
article earlier this year and they

986
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:48,240
pointed out how uh this uh Delta a THC

987
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:51,680
acetate when subjected to heat produced

988
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:55,318
this ketene which again is the lung

989
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:58,279
damaging compound um so the same thing

990
00:46:55,318 --> 00:47:03,679
potentially could happen with any uh

991
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:06,160
Delta 8 vape pen um if it had similar

992
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,199
contaminants right on so let's let's

993
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,159
tease out that Nuance a little bit

994
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:12,039
because I think that it is I think that

995
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:17,759
it's the Crux of this essentially the

996
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:22,558
entire episode um that that Delta 8 um

997
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:26,559
in a perfect world where it was

998
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:30,880
isolated properly in a lab

999
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:32,200
and then after the fact was cleaned up

1000
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,960
to

1001
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:37,719
remove

1002
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,679
contaminants which is a very uh lengthy

1003
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,919
and arduous process and takes you know

1004
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:45,480
Advanced

1005
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:50,079
skills that as that Delta 8 as a

1006
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:52,199
medicine does have applications and does

1007
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,880
cause you know a

1008
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:58,919
60% Euphoria effect 60% of what what

1009
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:02,358
Delta 9 does however that's not the

1010
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:06,079
world we live in the world we live in is

1011
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:07,119
that um folks without enough experience

1012
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,240
are

1013
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,119
are isolating Delta 8 not cleaning it up

1014
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:15,078
afterwards maybe don't have the

1015
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,200
experience to know everything that they

1016
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:21,039
that that they need to be pulling out

1017
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:23,480
don't have the budget or the lab to um

1018
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:26,639
identify the toxic contaminants and

1019
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:29,800
remove them and be and then this is the

1020
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:32,598
Delta 8 that is is being dumped onto the

1021
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:35,359
market that's being synthesized from CBD

1022
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:37,640
from hemp from the last three years and

1023
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,078
this is what the problem is so so it's

1024
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:42,679
not

1025
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:45,039
scientifically true Delta 8 the problem

1026
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:47,719
is in the reality that people aren't

1027
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:50,400
putting out pure Delta 8 and it's

1028
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:53,159
actually got all this um these these

1029
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,318
extra contaminants in

1030
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:58,358
it uh yeah I mean uh

1031
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:04,318
quite right I mean the way I'd put it

1032
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:06,719
succinctly is Delta 8 THC the molecule

1033
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:10,400
or compound is not the

1034
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,919
problem the problem is how that delta8

1035
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,519
TC is

1036
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,318
produced um and again the toxic

1037
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:22,318
byproducts and solvent

1038
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:25,679
residues so uh again don't blame the

1039
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:28,759
compound compounds all right but how

1040
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,279
it's made and available to Consumers is

1041
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:35,040
the problem and uh potentially a very

1042
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,798
big one um there was a popular study

1043
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:41,318
from 2021 that W that looked at this

1044
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:44,759
case of of of Delta 8 from CBD being

1045
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:47,558
sprayed on Delta 9 flour to make it more

1046
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,280
potent and and and then I believe

1047
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:53,559
subsequently they they were taking

1048
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:57,359
products from the licensed Market where

1049
00:49:53,559 --> 00:50:00,400
there should not be Delta 8 and there

1050
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:03,199
were all these products that had Delta 8

1051
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,880
in it um kind of like uh to

1052
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:11,039
fortify the the experience of the

1053
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:13,640
regular Delta 9 so so it's like uh you

1054
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:15,480
know a fortified vitamin or a fortified

1055
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:17,598
alcohol or something it's like it's like

1056
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,679
ah we we want to make it more strong and

1057
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,400
so we're going to we're going to add

1058
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:25,118
something extra and so people are adding

1059
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:27,639
Delta 8 um and and not mentioning it on

1060
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,760
the L a because it's in Most states it's

1061
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:32,838
not supposed to be in their licensed

1062
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,960
Market but they add delta8 so that their

1063
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:38,639
product has what they think is an

1064
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:41,519
improved experience can you um explain

1065
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:44,400
what the downside would be for for

1066
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,679
people to be buying products that have

1067
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,920
got Delta 8 in it without their

1068
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:53,679
knowledge uh well it's an unconscionable

1069
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:57,079
practice and um uh I would condemn

1070
00:50:53,679 --> 00:51:00,919
anyone who engages in that kind of

1071
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:04,160
activity um but beyond that uh again

1072
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,760
it's a matter of uh not knowing what

1073
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:09,480
you're getting the likelihood of

1074
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:13,640
Overdose uh if in a vape pen the

1075
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:16,679
possibilities of lung damage

1076
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:19,000
um and you know it's been demonstrated

1077
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:22,399
there've actually been studies that show

1078
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,480
that uh use rates of delta8 products are

1079
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,920
way higher in states that have

1080
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:31,880
restrictive cannabis policies as opposed

1081
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,480
to those that have Freer access to

1082
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,559
Natural

1083
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:39,920
cannabis uh

1084
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:43,798
compounds um so um and again this stuff

1085
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:47,318
is not uh without risks um there was a

1086
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:49,880
study earlier this year Simon at all um

1087
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:51,920
there's a reporting system at the Food

1088
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,039
and Drug Administration for

1089
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:58,440
nonprescription drugs it's called the

1090
00:51:54,039 --> 00:52:00,880
fairs uh system um and they've had a

1091
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,519
massive increase in reports associated

1092
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:08,240
with Delta 8 products um just to give a

1093
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:11,920
rundown uh 33 deaths attributed to Delta

1094
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:16,159
8 products um 49

1095
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:19,318
hospitalizations 109 serious reports 41

1096
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:22,118
nonserious and this one will surprise

1097
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:24,480
people there were more respiratory

1098
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:27,720
issues problems with the lungs that were

1099
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:31,679
reported for Delta ATHC products than

1100
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:33,959
any cannabis or hemp product M um so

1101
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:37,879
that puts it in context so these things

1102
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:41,798
are not without risk so this is quite in

1103
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:44,680
contrast um to the claims uh that have

1104
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:48,039
sometimes been made

1105
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:50,759
um there was a a paper that was

1106
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:53,920
published uh when it gotten past me if I

1107
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,480
reviewed it but in 2022 Krueger and

1108
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,280
Krueger public published a study it was

1109
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:03,000
just an online survey of people using

1110
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:07,359
Delta eight products um and you know

1111
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,079
they reported um that um I don't know

1112
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:11,960
how they made their comparisons it

1113
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:15,000
wouldn't be scientific but they reported

1114
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:17,798
delta8 was less intense uh produced

1115
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
relaxation and euphoria that it relieved

1116
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:22,519
pain but also uh was associated with

1117
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,480
short-term memory

1118
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:27,480
impairment um there was a comment from

1119
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,679
one consumer that got in the title of

1120
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:35,599
the paper and the quote was delta8 feels

1121
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:39,798
like Delta 99's nicer young sibling um

1122
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:43,119
and um that's just not borne out by the

1123
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:45,440
figures um uh and you know the

1124
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,200
conclusion of the article was quote

1125
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,559
Delta ATC May provide much of the

1126
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:54,439
experiential benefits of Delta 9 THC

1127
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:57,359
with lesser adverse effects that's just

1128
00:53:54,440 --> 00:54:00,559
plain wrong um and never should have

1129
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:03,960
been in a published scientific article

1130
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,480
um and I I won't cast aspersions on the

1131
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,000
publisher but I

1132
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,159
could and I think that this adds a lot

1133
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,559
to the confusion that we see amongst

1134
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:16,920
consumers about Delta 8 um you know I

1135
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,960
kind of came into the Delta 8

1136
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,039
understanding being prejudiced against

1137
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,079
Delta 8 I got to admit because I was

1138
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:28,239
only ever seeing it in really low

1139
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:32,599
quality unlicensed market products that

1140
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:35,318
were very low priced in um uh states

1141
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:37,599
where cannabis wasn't legal and let's be

1142
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:39,719
clear off the top that that um the fact

1143
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,960
that it's unlicensed doesn't actually

1144
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:44,639
bother me um you know we talk a lot

1145
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,559
about a lot about um individual patient

1146
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:50,639
freedoms and to grow your own um on this

1147
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:53,720
show but but what does get me is when a

1148
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:55,679
product is of crappy uh um Quality

1149
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:58,439
period whether it's in the Li Ed or in

1150
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:00,798
the unlicensed market and so I would

1151
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,519
when when I first started seeing Delta 8

1152
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:06,199
it was in you know the these states and

1153
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:08,679
and you know $10 Vape cartridges in

1154
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:10,519
really you know bad packaging and you

1155
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:13,039
could just tell like oh man somebody's

1156
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:16,159
going to get really sick from this stuff

1157
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:18,119
and then they did you know and and so um

1158
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:20,118
certainly there are products in the

1159
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:22,039
unlicensed Market that are are quality

1160
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:25,318
but certainly that's that's not most of

1161
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:28,839
them most of them are are of low quality

1162
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:32,239
and and because there there are papers

1163
00:55:28,838 --> 00:55:34,599
um like the one you just referred to um

1164
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,439
that product manufacturers can grasp on

1165
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:39,039
grasp on to and say hey look here's a

1166
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,960
study that says that you know it's safe

1167
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:46,240
and good it creates enough confusion in

1168
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:48,838
the market um where where people don't

1169
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:51,118
aren't educated and so they buy what

1170
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:54,440
they can afford and so these products

1171
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,079
are are finding themselves more into uh

1172
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,159
states that are are not legal and then

1173
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,400
people who are lwi Income which is you

1174
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:04,639
know such a drag um I also found it

1175
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:07,240
interesting that um there's an ASN white

1176
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:09,558
paper in 2021 pointing out that the

1177
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:13,078
instructions for synthesizing Delta 8

1178
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:15,599
are easily found on YouTube um but it's

1179
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:18,680
it's it's not as simple as it's often

1180
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:22,680
presented on YouTube most people don't

1181
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:24,919
have the the skills to do it safely and

1182
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:27,558
the study says it results in wildly un

1183
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:31,400
ended consequences so are those

1184
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:33,000
unintended consequences the same um uh

1185
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,599
toxic components that we've already

1186
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,760
referred to or or is it something even

1187
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:42,798
further than that uh no that's it uh you

1188
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:45,720
know basically they referred in that uh

1189
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:48,920
white paper to acetic acid available in

1190
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:51,919
your kitchen uh Translating that means

1191
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:55,639
vinegar so there there would be ways of

1192
00:56:51,920 --> 00:57:01,400
making this with vinegar and heat um um

1193
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:03,358
but again um you know I don't trust a

1194
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,599
lab to do this

1195
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:10,558
properly why would we have any inkling

1196
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,280
that someone uh doing this in their as a

1197
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:16,039
kitchen chemist would have better luck

1198
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,440
in what they produce um no one should

1199
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:21,640
ever try

1200
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:24,358
this right on so um to to to wrap us up

1201
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:26,358
here in set two um and and I know we're

1202
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:28,119
putting a sharp point on this but I I

1203
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:30,038
don't think that we can put too sharp of

1204
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:32,960
a point on it you know a lot of people

1205
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:34,839
say you know hey delta8 is in the plant

1206
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,760
we've been using the plant for you know

1207
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:40,639
thousands of years Delta 8 has a natural

1208
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,799
or origin and therefore and natural

1209
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:45,519
products are safe and therefore they say

1210
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:47,920
that Delta 8 in in their products is

1211
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:52,400
fine but but that's just not the right

1212
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:56,119
way to think about it is it no no all

1213
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,559
right so um let's wrap up here in uh set

1214
00:57:56,119 --> 00:58:01,680
three um we're going to start uh talking

1215
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:04,640
about some of the unexpected attributes

1216
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,919
of Delta 8 and you know some of the

1217
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:08,679
interesting questions about uh deltra 8

1218
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,000
and how to think about it that that just

1219
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:12,199
haven't um fit into the show so far it's

1220
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,480
going to be kind of a hodg podge of

1221
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:16,279
interesting Delta eight topics I guess

1222
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,280
so uh let's go ahead and take um our

1223
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,880
second short break and be right back you

filled with big name and hype breeders

01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,400
fighting to get your attention and

1298
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:07,159
occasionally you discover a breeder who

1299
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,960
is breeding because it is the only thing

1300
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:11,679
they care to do and they would be doing

1301
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,240
it even if they never made a dime that's

1302

my friend Craig hardsaw who makes seeds

1303
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:18,679
as magnetic genetics Craig comes from

1304
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,000
five generations of farmers and is

1305
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:22,199
earning his master's degree in

1306
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,480
horiculture right now he's been growing

1307
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:27,078
cannabis for 15 years and been breeding

1308
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,119
for nine he hasn't sold many seeds

1309
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:30,599
because he really isn't a sales guy but

1310
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,760
I've personally been growing his seeds

1311
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:35,079
for years and I know I can always rely

1312
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,799
on his seeds to germinate Thrive and

1313
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:39,559
smell and taste great I suggested to

1314
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:41,400
Craig that he should probably sell some

1315
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:44,400
seeds and asked if he had enough

1316
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:47,079
stockpiled to bother much to my shock he

1317
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,838
was sitting on five full menus in Cold

1318
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:50,760
Storage that he produced in the last two

1319
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:53,880
years and hadn't even tried to sell any

1320
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,960
of them he was simply too busy breeding

1321
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,720
well we his friends convinced him to

1322
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:00,440
make his damn seeds available to the

1323
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:02,480
people and now they are for the first

1324
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:05,039
time anywhere you can now buy magnetic

1325
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,838
genetic seeds at neptun Seedbank and on

1329
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:16,960
your interest they are carrying three

1330

thing from the brand you admire but when

1343

org and on Instagram magnetic

1347
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:02,880
genetics welcome back you are listening

1348
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,480
to shaping fire I'm your host Shango and

1349
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,400
my guest today is neurologist and

1350
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,880
cannabis researcher Dr Ethan Russo so

1351
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,079
here in the last set we're going to talk

1352
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,119
mostly about um things that like didn't

1353
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:15,318
really fit in the rest of the show and

1354
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,240
there's some really interesting stuff uh

1355
01:03:15,318 --> 01:03:19,519
uh about Delta eight that we haven't

1356
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:22,558
touched on yet and and the first thing I

1357
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:24,599
want to uh talk about Ethan is that you

1358
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:29,278
know we mentioned um early way back in

1359
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:32,200
the first set that um that uh Delta 8

1360
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:34,318
Works effectively as an antimimetic in

1361
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:36,318
kids who are uh experiencing chemo

1362
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:39,920
therapy meaning that it decreases their

1363
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:42,679
nausea have we found anything else that

1364
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,720
delta8 can do well I guess anything at

1365
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:46,519
all because because Delta 9 may actually

1366
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:48,639
be better than Delta 8 for this but have

1367
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:51,519
we found anything that Delta 8 can do

1368
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:54,480
that that naturally

1369
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:56,798
occurring um Delta 9 THC and the the

1370
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,440
other naturally occurring canabo don't

1371
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,880
do better is there is there anything

1372
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,200
unique that Delta 8 can do that the

1373
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:07,559
other canabo can't

1374
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:10,278
do uh yes and it would be its stability

1375
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:11,319
to heat uh as demonstrated in the

1376
01:04:10,278 --> 01:04:15,000
ancient

1377
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:18,038
sample and um I suppose there could be

1378
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,358
some jurisdictions around the the world

1379
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:25,960
where they had a law that specifically

1380
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:28,480
cited Delta 9 THC and didn't site the

1381
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:31,079
Delta 8 and it might be possible there

1382
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,880
to use Delta 8

1383
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:37,318
preferentially um but you know that's a

1384
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:41,079
a legal Point not a medical point so

1385
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:44,119
it's thermal stability is it's um main

1386
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:45,880
selling point is the thermal stability

1387
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:48,720
something that is actually a health

1388
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:51,798
benefit or is that more a oh because

1389
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:53,519
it's more thermally stable it makes it a

1390
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:55,079
good choice for some particular

1391
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:57,639
Pharmaceutical products that have got to

1392
01:04:55,079 --> 01:05:01,318
be heated it would be that kind of

1393
01:04:57,639 --> 01:05:03,598
situation or shelf life issues but um I

1394
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:05,358
don't see this is being commercially

1395
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,798
developed in any

1396
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:12,239
capacity um meaning now or in the future

1397
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:14,639
or both yeah uh because um to make a

1398
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:17,118
Delta 8 prescription product it's going

1399
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:20,239
to have to go through years of testing

1400
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,838
and uh hundreds of millions of dollars

1401
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:25,038
in expenditure to get it through Phase 1

1402
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:27,759
to three clinical trial I don't see

1403
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:29,880
anybody doing that mhm because the

1404
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,278
promise of it doesn't seem to be J

1405
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,640
justify that much time and resources

1406
01:05:32,278 --> 01:05:38,199
yeah two points one is it wouldn't be

1407
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:40,798
worth the investment and two it's never

1408
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:44,038
going to do what herbal cannabis in a

1409
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,880
proper preparation can do MH so this

1410
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:48,240
would be the place where I typically

1411
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,318
invoke the Entourage

1412
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:51,838
effect um go ahead why don't you go

1413
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:55,079
ahead and invoke it for those who aren't

1414
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:58,519
familiar with it um there's nothing that

1415
01:05:55,079 --> 01:06:00,680
pure THC whether Delta 9 or delta8 can

1416
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:03,079
do that can't be done better by a

1417
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:06,118
properly con

1418
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:08,880
constituted um herbal cannabis

1419
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:11,440
preparation um you know uh we really

1420
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,079
benefit from having additional canabo

1421
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,798
and terpenoids that reduce the side

1422
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:19,720
effect profile of THC in either

1423
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:23,000
form and it makes for a better more

1424
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:24,838
tolerable and more effective medicine

1425
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,159
excellent excellent we we always love to

1426
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:29,078
support the whole plant medicine

1427
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:31,798
thinking here on the show so you know uh

1428
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:34,359
during shaping Fire episode 14 all the

1429
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:36,960
way back five years ago with Dr Greg

1430
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:39,558
German uh we discussed how synthetic

1431
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:43,880
cannaboids can sometimes be used in the

1432
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:45,920
lab as a tool so so not as something

1433
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,240
that a human is actually going to ingest

1434
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:52,200
for a medical reason but something that

1435
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:54,519
can be used in the lab as a tool to do

1436
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:57,399
you know one or other experiment or

1437
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:59,440
process um would you explain briefly how

1438
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,680
synthetic cannabinoids can be useful in

1439
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,358
a lab setting and then also whether

1440
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:07,278
you're aware of any useful tool that

1441
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:10,679
Delta 8 has become in the

1442
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:13,079
lab uh okay well you know there actually

1443
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:15,078
been hundreds of synthetic cannabinoids

1444
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:17,760
that have been used in the lab some of

1445
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:20,480
these are extremely potent as compared

1446
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,278
to Delta 9

1447
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:27,838
THC um those can be useful in pointing

1448
01:07:23,278 --> 01:07:30,480
out path ways or the patterns of uh The

1449
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:33,440
receptors in a given organ especially

1450
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,880
the brain so they're just tools that are

1451
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,720
used that way and they they're often

1452
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:42,240
used in animal studies uh believe it or

1453
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:44,078
not it's easier to acquire a lot of

1454
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,759
these synthetics than it is to get

1455
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:49,960
permission to use Delta 9 UM in such

1456
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:54,240
experiments but we have to be very

1457
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:56,199
careful um rats are not humans and in

1458
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:00,598
particular uh there've been some

1459
01:07:56,199 --> 01:08:04,439
distinctions in the Affinity of uh Delta

1460
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:07,680
8 for canabo receptors in certain

1461
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:12,798
species of animals as compared to humans

1462
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:15,198
um so um uh I hate to say this but you

1463
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:18,960
can only learn so much from animal

1464
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:22,000
studies um that's true um there are

1465
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:25,079
distinct differences and uh any such

1466
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,600
literature has to be read with that in

1467
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:32,000
mind that um that's interesting but it

1468
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:35,400
may not translate to human clinical

1469
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,719
use um do you think that there are um

1470
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:40,158
folks that are using Delta 8 as a tool

1471
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:41,960
in the lab or or is that not necessarily

1472
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:45,039
one of the synthetic cannabinoids that

1473
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:48,079
that has use in a lab in that way um it

1474
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:52,158
has been used I wouldn't say a great

1475
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:54,719
deal um but again it uh might have to do

1476
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:58,079
with things like uh its

1477
01:08:54,719 --> 01:09:03,158
stability as compared to Delta 9 right

1478
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:07,359
on so um in uh some of the studies that

1479
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:10,679
have uh grabbed um products from the

1480
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:12,359
licensed Market um as well as our

1481
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:15,279
general awareness of products in the

1482
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:19,719
unlicensed Market we find that some

1483
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:23,839
people will fail drug tests um because

1484
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:28,399
they've had uh Delta 8 um with Delta 18

1485
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:31,600
HC and and uh folks think that oh it's

1486
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:34,238
got Delta 8 it doesn't have you know

1487
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,480
real cannabis in it if you will these

1488
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:39,399
people will say and so and so they think

1489
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:41,559
it's safe to use but yet they still um

1490
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:43,838
fail drug tests for you know their

1491
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:48,159
trucking job or whatever so will you

1492
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:51,359
just explain briefly why um a Delta 8 is

1493
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:54,319
is is not safe for people who have to

1494
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:56,199
take drug tests uh sure you know as we

1495
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:59,000
said in the beginning the only

1496
01:09:56,198 --> 01:10:00,879
difference is where this double bond is

1497
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:07,000
that makes a difference between Delta 8

1498
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:12,239
and Delta 9 so in um analytical assays

1499
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:14,520
for urine testing metabolites of THC

1500
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:17,519
they're going to show up anyway so the

1501
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:21,960
bottom line is if you're getting urine

1502
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:24,679
testing for your job don't use Delta 8

1503
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:27,119
Simple right on easy and to the Point um

1504
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:30,760
you know a lot of people uh who are

1505
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:32,760
looking to defend um uh Delta 8 um you

1506
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,320
know as it's commercially made right now

1507
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,800
as an Agricultural Product um you know

1508
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:39,679
they they say listen it's an it's an

1509
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,119
Agricultural Product like anything else

1510
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:45,000
and and we should be allowed to use it

1511
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:47,719
um but on your webinar the other day it

1512
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,439
was mentioned why you know Delta 8

1513
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:50,960
doesn't make sense to consider it an

1514
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:52,238
Agricultural Product and and would you

1515
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,119
repeat that

1516
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:58,879
analysis uh sure sure you know uh it had

1517
01:10:56,119 --> 01:11:02,679
its first origin in a plant grown in the

1518
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:06,039
ground presumably although um some

1519
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:09,760
delta8 may be made from synthetic CBD

1520
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:12,479
but once it gets into the lab and

1521
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:15,039
subjected to these chemical

1522
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:17,599
transmogrifications it's not natural

1523
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:20,000
it's not an Agricultural Product it's a

1524
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,560
synthetic product and one that

1525
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,719
invariably is

1526
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:28,280
contaminated right on so so is there a

1527
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:31,760
is there a scientific threshold point

1528
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:33,960
where um where a a molecule that started

1529
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:36,400
out in a plant is now considered a

1530
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:39,920
synthetic because I'm figuring that

1531
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:42,439
somewhere along that chain of synthesis

1532
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,119
um you know it's it's officially no

1533
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:49,519
longer an Agricultural Product does that

1534
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:52,920
threshold exist or is that um more um um

1535
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,600
subjective uh anytime you've changed one

1536
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,279
thing in something else that's uh no

1537
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:00,880
longer

1538
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:03,158
agricultural right on fair enough um

1539
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,920
we've had you on shaping fire uh before

1540
01:12:03,158 --> 01:12:09,039
to talk about canabo hyperemesis

1541
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,039
syndrome and um this is the likelihood

1542
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:13,359
that that someone will be especially

1543
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:16,238
sensitive to cannabis causing a whole

1544
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:19,479
range of negative symptoms um have we

1545
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:22,238
seen um cannabinoid hyperemesis Syndrome

1546
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:25,718
from um being caused by D Delta 8

1547
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:28,079
products yes in 2021 there was a case

1548
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:30,359
report uh this is a woman who'd had

1549
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:33,519
prior gastric surgery and came in with

1550
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:35,198
nazine vomiting so she got a CAT scan to

1551
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,800
make sure that nothing was wrong with

1552
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:41,599
the surgery um and her nause and

1553
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:44,480
vomiting wasn't responding to the usual

1554
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,679
approaches and drugs that they used uh

1555
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:51,238
it turned out she'd been using Delta a

1556
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:54,399
THC gummies um they suspected she had

1557
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:56,959
canabo hyperemesis syndrome and then

1558
01:12:54,399 --> 01:13:00,479
responded to drugs that seem to work

1559
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,039
better there uh specifically haloperidol

1560
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:06,000
which is a major

1561
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:09,920
tranquilizer um and um capsus anointment

1562
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,319
on the skin so canono hyperemesis

1563
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:17,079
syndrome will be caused by

1564
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:20,079
anything uh whether Delta 9 Delta 8 or

1565
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:23,719
synthetic cannabinoids that are

1566
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:25,279
stimulating the CB1 receptor the main

1567
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:27,319
psychoactive

1568
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:31,399
receptor uh for

1569
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:35,599
canabo um so yes Delta 8 can be

1570
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:38,000
associated with CHS right on thank you

1571
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,639
so uh as we wrap up here at the end of

1572
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,920
set three um I think I want to wrap up

1573
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:49,359
by reading a couple of um um quotes from

1574
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:52,039
uh the the SE hodala study from 2021 uh

1575
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:54,039
We Believe In Unicorns and Delta 8 uh

1576
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:55,639
from the Cannabis scientist

1577
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:57,880
um and then and then and then I'm going

1578
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:59,440
to ask you a question and and and we'll

1579
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:02,440
we'll wrap up here so so here are a

1580
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:04,439
couple quotes from from that paper um

1581
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:06,759
the problem is not with Delta 8 but the

1582
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:08,119
unregulated distribution of synthetic

1583
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:10,600
contaminated

1584
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:11,960
products at least Walter White was a

1585
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,679
chemistry

1586
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,480
teacher Delta 8 has become a money

1587
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:19,000
printing

1588
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:21,158
machine but when I show producers what

1589
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,319
it is in their sample they don't stop

1590
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:24,000
making it and they don't stop

1591
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:27,279
Distributing it they just go to another

1592
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:31,079
lab who not acknowledge the contaminants

1593
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:33,639
found um this really points to oh so I'm

1594
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:37,279
no longer quoting anymore this is my

1595
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:41,279
voice now um this really points to the

1596
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:45,279
the shyy nature of a particular um

1597
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:47,439
section of the um unlicensed Market but

1598
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:50,519
even some of the licensed Market because

1599
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:53,919
we know Delta 8 has has snuck into state

1600
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,760
level um legal markets

1601
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,560
and and let's finish with this Ean you

1602
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,199
know I know you're very passionate about

1603
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:04,320
this um as a you know as a medical

1604
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:07,678
doctor and also as a cannabis researcher

1605
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:11,119
uh in search for the truth um for folks

1606
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:13,719
that are making these um Delta 8 um

1607
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:17,679
products that we know are all coming

1608
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:21,239
from uh synthesis from CBD um you know

1609
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:24,319
what message would you have for them um

1610
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:26,879
uh uh in encouragement uh to perhaps

1611
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:30,238
reconsider their

1612
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:33,560
approach um again I would state that

1613
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:36,359
there's nothing that Delta 8 does that

1614
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:39,080
can't be done more safely and

1615
01:15:36,359 --> 01:15:42,198
effectively with a natural cannabis

1616
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:46,039
product now that may not be available to

1617
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:48,919
everyone but um you know I hope that uh

1618
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:51,679
the laws will change and that we see

1619
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:53,639
this Commerce and Delta 8 disappear

1620
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,880
because to repeat what I said said

1621
01:15:53,639 --> 01:15:59,119
earlier uh Delta 8 craze is a byproduct

1622
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,000
of

1623
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:04,559
prohibition well said and and at the end

1624
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,800
this problem um sits at the feet of our

1625
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:10,199
legislators who are choosing to drag

1626
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:12,960
their feet inste instead of taking um

1627
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:15,399
real um legalization

1628
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,239
action well thank you Ethan um it's

1629
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:19,920
always a pleasure to have you on uh

1630
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:23,879
shaping fire and um especially with such

1631
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:25,960
a uh a nuanced topic as this um that is

1632
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:27,840
just not getting enough attention I

1633
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,719
appreciate you taking um your time and

1634
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,840
