2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:10,888
you are listening to shaping fire and

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,109
I'm your host Shango Lowe's before we

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,548
get in today's episode I want to explain

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:17,579
why it's been a month since the last

6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:19,500
episode see it's summer growing season

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,659
right now and even though I'm not a

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,600
professional grower nor do I grow in

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,028
volume here locally on Vashon Island

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,890
where I live I help out in a lot of

11
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:31,890
different cannabis patient gardens

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,600
because I do so much patient education

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,489
here I tend to make friends with folks

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,170
who use cannabis medicine and they often

15
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,780
ask for a little help with you know this

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,460
or that during the summer well there was

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,590
a whole lot and more of that this year

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,480
than ever before more and more people

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,430
are wanting to grow a few plants to make

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,619
their own tincture or RSO or whatever

21
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,019
you know it's great to see but that's a

22
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,538
lot more people to you know help get set

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,520
up and help identify deficiencies and

24
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,948
then stop by to help them determine if a

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,440
plant is male and when to harvest by

26
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:04,920
looking at the trichomes because I got

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,200
into this work with patients I chose to

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,640
work in their gardens rather than be in

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,820
my office in front of the computer

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,239
pretty easily also though this is

31
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,919
research and development season for me

32
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,599
summertime is when probiotic growers and

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,879
cannabis breeders are practicing their

34
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,069
craft and I got to go out into the field

35
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,199
to learn earlier this month I

36
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,209
disappeared into humbled and Mendocino

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,280
for a couple weeks to record content for

38
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,169
the YouTube channel and also find out

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,540
what's you know new and interesting and

40
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,868
you know that is time that I'm not in

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,118
the studio making shows that said these

42
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:40,859
road trips without an agenda where I

43
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,930
just explore and meet people

44
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,609
keeps the podcast and the YouTube

45
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,520
channel content interesting

46
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:50,129
it's from going on those kind of feral

47
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,949
trips that the energy and the ideas for

48
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,688
shaping fire come from so yeah next

49
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,210
thing I knew it was August and it's been

50
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,489
five weeks and here we are in my own

51
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,949
defense I also did have two guests

52
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,379
postponed recording their episodes last

53
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,240
minute because they too were also busy

54
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:09,299
getting their own full term crops in the

55
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,038
ground we'll talk to them in November if

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,989
you want to learn about cannabis health

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,469
business and technique efficiently and

58
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,240
with good

59
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,430

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,360
compost an ultra premium living food web

87
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,180
compost when I first heard colum speak

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,980
about the bio regionalism of microbes I

89
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,560
just about jumped out of my seat with

90
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,109
curiosity the idea that all of this

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,479
living soil microbe community stuff

92
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,150
we're all into actually differs by

93
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,009
location and climate really opened up a

94
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,200
huge new set of variables and

95
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,909
understanding and I really had to ask

96
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,129
him a bunch of questions about it that's

97
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:40,709
what we're gonna talk about today today

98
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:43,590
we're gonna go deep deep into compost

99
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,449
welcome to the show : fantastic to be

100
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,670
here Shango excellent so nice to hear

101
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:49,439
your voice again so so let's get started

102
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,238
with some quick basics because there's

103
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,509
some people who are still pretty new to

104
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,849
compost and so for people who don't know

105
00:03:54,509 --> 00:04:00,000
please give us a brief understanding of

106
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:03,539
what compost is and how basically it's

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,009
made at home excellent question and

108
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,319
there is a lot of confusion around

109
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:09,539
compost so not to sound like the

110
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,269
stereotypical professor but sometimes it

111
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,620
helps to start with the definition and

112
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:15,090
in this case I'd like to give a

113
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,310
definition that actually just got

114
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,108
reworded in the last year by the u.s.

115
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,228
composting council but it's important to

116
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:25,079
kind of break down and what they say is

117
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:27,360
compost is the product manufactured

118
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,240
through the controlled

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,819
aerobic biological decomposition of

120
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,310
biodegradable materials so it's

121
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,500
undergone mesophilic and thermophilic

122
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,360
temperatures you're reducing the weed

123
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,699
seeds and the pathogens you're

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,729
stabilizing the carbon to make it

125
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:48,030
beneficial to plant growth and then

126
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:50,430
there's a whole host of uses for it but

127
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:52,739
it's important to understand in that

128
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:57,650
definition that it's a controlled

129
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:01,530
process and it's aerobic and biological

130
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:04,769
decomposition of materials so so before

131
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:07,769
we go to the biologic decomposition with

132
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:09,628
aerobic which means oxygen what are the

133
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:13,500
two thermic that you I don't know those

134
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:16,669
two words ah mesophilic and thermophilic

135
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,139
refer to different temperature ranges so

136
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:20,968
we'll take this down to the home

137
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,740
composter so when you pile a bunch of

138
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:24,418
stuff in a corner of your yard and come

139
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,968
back a year later that's not really

140
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:29,240
controlled and it's not really aerobic

141
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:32,310
and there's definitely some biological

142
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,560
decomposition but you're missing two of

143
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,168
those other factors and as far as

144
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,968
temperature when you turn a pile or cut

145
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:40,889
into it sometimes you can see steam

146
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:44,990
sometimes you can put your hand in and

147
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:48,088
feel the heat um but the temperature is

148
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,158
one of those four variables of the earth

149
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:53,968
water air and fire that's the fire

150
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:55,879
aspect and so a thermophilic process is

151
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:59,158
when you get temperatures that exceed

152
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:02,189
133 degrees and that's sort of

153
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:04,860
considered the proper threshold it kills

154
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:07,709
off weed seeds it'll kill off pathogens

155
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,218
like fecal coliform or ecoli or

156
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:13,799
salmonella but you don't really want

157
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:15,778
that thermophilic range to go much

158
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,400
higher than a hundred and sixty degrees

159
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:20,098
where you start killing off a lot of the

160
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,620
beneficial microbiology and we can come

161
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:25,680
back to that so a typical compost cycle

162
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:29,009
you want to build the materials such

163
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,348
that they can have air flow and the

164
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,509
carbon and nitrogen materials are mixed

165
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:35,879
with moisture being another variable in

166
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:39,718
such a way that the temperatures can

167
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,920
exceed 133 degrees so that hot phase is

168
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:44,269
considered the thermal

169
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,860
feliks breakdown of the compost pile and

170
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:49,289
mesophilic is more sort of that

171
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,500
simmering down range as the temperatures

172
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:57,240
drop under 130 but they're still well

173
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:00,449
above an ambient temperature as far as

174
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,430
getting to that temperature some people

175
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,719
you know bake their soil and that's not

176
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,129
what you're talking about right you're

177
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,200
talking about letting the compost itself

178
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:13,219
generate heat from degradation and

179
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,360
bringing its own temperature up right

180
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,200
absolutely I mean one of the ways I like

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,180
to break it down when I talk to kids is

182
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,490
think about microbes sweating and if you

183
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,730
got a whole bunch of microbes with a

184
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,670
gigantic pile of food to consume their

185
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:32,160
job is to shred that food literally some

186
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:35,280
of we have soil food webs called

187
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,650
shredders so they are shredding and they

188
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,409
are sweating and they are working up

189
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:42,719
steam literally and figuratively

190
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,410
and so that break down is what's

191
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,120
producing that heat as you have this

192
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,880
bacteria breaking down attacking the

193
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,009
surface area of the materials again they

194
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,019
need oxygen a lot of people don't

195
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,480
understand the importance of airflow but

196
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:01,349
it's like any living organism you need

197
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,990
water and air and food to survive so

198
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,720
during this process with all that new

199
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,180
material that hasn't yet been broken

200
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,160
down that's largely when you see the

201
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,720
temperatures is in the first phase of

202
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,689
the composting process where you have

203
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,350
this rapid breakdown and decomposition

204
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:22,170
that's all run by these digesters just

205
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:27,900
the think of it the compost pile is like

206
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:29,730
the digestive tract pre-application of

207
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,189
the soil right on that makes a lot of

208
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,200
sense and you know you know that might

209
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,330
be a definition you develop for kids but

210
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,680
that is really gets right to the point I

211
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,290
think I would be using that myself with

212
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,939
adults so so thanks for sharing that so

213
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,719
so the other part of your definition

214
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,330
that is really important is the aerobic

215
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,570
breakdown because this is very

216
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,560
specifically oxygen centric so you will

217
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,810
you break out that part of the

218
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,059
definition yeah and there's

219
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,619
two things I guess in the broad sense of

220
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,479
things it's important for your listeners

221
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,028
understand there is what I would term

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,810
intentional composting and what I would

223
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:08,610
term organics recycling and both of them

224
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:10,859
have a very important place and I would

225
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,470
say organics recycling is trying to take

226
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,110
organic matter and recycle it in such a

227
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,269
way that you can derive benefits and get

228
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,839
the nutrients back out of it and reapply

229
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:24,569
it to the land and even a lot of quote

230
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,960
unquote composting facilities or

231
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,339
operations or people calling themselves

232
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:33,089
composters or even material in the

233
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:35,190
marketplace labeled as compost is really

234
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,170
recycled organic matter it's been piled

235
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,300
up it's been degraded it's kind of

236
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:43,679
broken down and it's sort of turned into

237
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:45,659
this broken down black or brown material

238
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,120
that's not as distinguishable from how

239
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:50,399
it started but that's not necessarily a

240
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,649
controlled process you know with the

241
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,230
biological the chemical or the physical

242
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,209
properties in place so intentional

243
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,089
composting is really looking at what do

244
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,670
you want out of this what we're looking

245
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:05,400
for all the attributes of compost

246
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:07,559
everything that compost is and we're

247
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,649
building the pile and controlling the

248
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:14,819
process to derive that out of the

249
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:17,129
finished product so we need air we need

250
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,170
the pile to breathe and a pile typically

251
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,269
breeze from the bottom and breathe out

252
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,759
and that's what's allowing the microbes

253
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:26,730
to break everything down turning the

254
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:30,299
pile is critical because as things

255
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:34,830
compact the oxygen the space for free

256
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:37,019
air space disappears and the more things

257
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,089
become come back compacted and the more

258
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,699
oxygen that's eaten up by the microbes

259
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:44,000
in the pile there's no more oxygen and

260
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,770
so what this leads to is anaerobic

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,049
conditions and all you need to do is

262
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:51,389
take some material put it in a glass jar

263
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:54,149
and put a lid on it a biological

264
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:57,299
material and it comes back funky and

265
00:10:54,149 --> 00:11:00,600
putrid that's what happens in anaerobic

266
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:03,120
conditions it can't really breathe and

267
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,959
anaerobic conditions can cause a lot of

268
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,669
harmful microbes and other harm to your

269
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,629
plants if that's not prop

270
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:14,759
we composted broken down allowed to have

271
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:17,370
the oxygenation process the second part

272
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,490
is when the oxygen when the compost gets

273
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,350
more towards a finished phase it still

274
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,500
needs to be able to breathe there's a

275
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,659
finished process that is typically

276
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,629
called the curing process and if you

277
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:33,529
think about a wine being allowed to to

278
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:37,620
ripen to have this expression there's a

279
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:40,500
maturity and a balancing during this

280
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,480
curing phase it also allows things like

281
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,659
ammonia to convert to plant available

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,159
nitrogen so many are people now that you

283
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:49,350
kind of hear the definitions you can

284
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,029
understand you can cut into a bag or

285
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,190
sometimes open a bag of commercial

286
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:55,620
compost and you get this strong ammonia

287
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,510
smell that means the compost wasn't

288
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,789
finished it wasn't the microbes weren't

289
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,860
finished doing their jobs or it was

290
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:03,990
exposed to anaerobic conditions and the

291
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,800
same thing happens with severely

292
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,149
compacted compost even on our farms are

293
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,429
in your piles you'll find that

294
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:13,649
oftentimes at the bottom of the pile and

295
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:17,849
you can certainly turn that around

296
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:19,769
riah mend it keep working it recom post

297
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,680
it for all intents and purposes as a way

298
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:25,169
to do it but the ideas that's ultimately

299
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,019
take it through a process have the

300
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:29,849
materials in the proper ratios to begin

301
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,299
with with the moisture and the oxygen

302
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:36,060
turn the piles so you avoid the

303
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:38,039
anaerobic phase you create hot

304
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:40,019
temperatures to be able to kill off the

305
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,659
pathogens and the weed seeds and break

306
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:45,509
it down and then let it cool down and

307
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:47,789
simmer and finish during that mesophilic

308
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:50,879
phase 2 where the compost is going to

309
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:54,179
mature and stabilize and be ready to do

310
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,820
its job in the soil you know that idea

311
00:12:54,179 --> 00:13:00,000
about opening a bag of compost and

312
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,460
smelling the ammonia I actually was

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,659
really startled the first time I you

314
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,129
know that's the stuff that I normally

315
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,870
get right that's the stuff that I had

316
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:08,429
historically purchased his stuff you

317
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,870
open it up it's a little damp

318
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:12,329
it smells like ammonia it's like okay

319
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:16,409
this is what I use but then I did score

320
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:19,470
a bag of your Malibu compost and and

321
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:21,929
when I opened it you know it wasn't wet

322
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,899
it didn't smell like ammonia and

323
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:28,229
visually it looked like really really

324
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:30,629
high-quality soil it was it was more it

325
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,460
was more granular with occasional chunks

326
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:34,919
and it and it smelled good it had that

327
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,110
that that you know who miss smell like

328
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,269
you get when you go out into the forest

329
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,839
and you smell like the forest Duff as

330
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:44,879
you as you walk along and I'm like oh my

331
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,560
gosh this is this must be what it's

332
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,389
supposed to be like because like I got

333
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,039
you know I picked up a bag after I heard

334
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,299
you speak for the first time right so

335
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,799
I'm really alright this this stuff

336
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,689
sounds crazy I need to check this out

337
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,370
for myself and so boom so and then I'm

338
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,980
like wow this this really is incredible

339
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,799
so so since since our conversation is

340
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,490
moving slowly but surely towards talking

341
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:08,849
about micro bioregion and and you and

342
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:11,879
your company ship all over let's take

343
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,820
that basic idea of how we make compost

344
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:18,000
at home and scale it up because I've

345
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,670
seen photos of your compost piles on

346
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,278
your Instagram and they are you know

347
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:26,519
I've got a compost pile right but you've

348
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,620
got like like these long compost lines

349
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,870
that's like a huge pile that just goes

350
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,940
on and on and on that looks like it goes

351
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,310
on four acres you know in the

352
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,350
photographs so so will you give me a

353
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:40,559
give us a little idea of how you take

354
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:43,170
that basic idea of compost and then you

355
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,838
scale it up so that you can make a

356
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:47,639
premium commercial product and you know

357
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,550
and when once we have those those

358
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,100
technicalities of the scale up will will

359
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:56,278
have a good basis for our next wave of

360
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,170
the conversation absolutely I mean it

361
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,080
that the principles are all still

362
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:03,509
fundamentally the same and so in your

363
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,480
home compost pile if you're looking to

364
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:08,789
get thermophilic hot temperatures you're

365
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,009
gonna need at least one cubic yard of

366
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:13,679
mass of material that means at least

367
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:16,740
three feet tall three feet wide three

368
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,679
feet deep minimum and typically your

369
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,079
compost will shrink 50 percent so you

370
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,909
want to build your piles much bigger and

371
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,879
they're gonna shrink down but you need

372
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:28,980
to have enough mass to have those

373
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,528
microbes be able to generate that heat

374
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,570
and break it down so understand that as

375
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:35,820
a general rule of thumb when I you know

376
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,470
tell people home composting systems

377
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,080
the simplest things you'll find is

378
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,620
either a pallet system with four pallets

379
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:46,650
one underneath and three on the sides or

380
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,629
a large kind of circular chicken-wire

381
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:50,490
type of structure where you can make

382
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:53,039
your compost in but you need to have

383
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:56,159
enough mass and so we're doing the same

384
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:58,379
thing on the farm in terms of mass but

385
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,009
we're using a windrow system and so a

386
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:05,100
windrow is just essentially a large long

387
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:07,799
row I typically build the piles no

388
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,259
higher than 5 or 6 feet tall knowing

389
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,870
that they're gonna shrink and no wider

390
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:16,350
than 12 feet tall we do use a compost

391
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:18,509
Turner to turn the piles and kind of

392
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,399
goes through it turns the outside in and

393
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:23,069
the inside out you can also roll your

394
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,529
piles with a front-end loader a skid

395
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,780
steers one of my favorites but

396
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:30,029
essentially you're just building it in a

397
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,709
long structure it's the same concept

398
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:36,029
that you have enough material in one

399
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:38,070
place together another consideration is

400
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,230
obviously having that proper carbon and

401
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,820
nitrogen ratio and we can certainly you

402
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,289
know talk more about that but that's

403
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,600
where you hear people talk about your

404
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:47,730
greens and your Browns and layering it

405
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,330
but it's important no matter what you do

406
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:54,570
is understand the exact characteristics

407
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,910
of whatever you're using in that pile

408
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,570
and as the piles shrink you want to have

409
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:03,120
more material but you sometimes want to

410
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,650
start a new pile so in home compost or

411
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,049
people with tumblers they say the

412
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,940
compost is never ready well it's hard to

413
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:11,369
have it ready when you're always adding

414
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,830
brand-new materials so sometimes a two

415
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:15,899
bin system is great where the one gets

416
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,689
really tall and full and then you start

417
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,400
a new pile you're able to kind of rework

418
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,440
your old pile so in a commercial setting

419
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,530
I'll have the same thing I'll build a

420
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,210
windrow five or six feet tall it gets a

421
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:29,940
hundred and forty hundred and forty-five

422
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:32,940
degrees inside everybody's steaming away

423
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,710
and chowing down and that pile suddenly

424
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,980
shrunk for five and a half feet to three

425
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,990
feet tall and so for that secondary

426
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,720
phase of the compost oftentimes I'll

427
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,420
push to Windrose together and combine

428
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,029
them so there's still enough mass to

429
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,850
hold the heat and finish the process but

430
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:51,168
the other variable you know

431
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:53,629
you're dealing with California and

432
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:55,850
Oregon and winters and summers is you

433
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,860
want to be able to hold in moisture you

434
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:59,839
don't want too much surface area in the

435
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:02,418
winter months and sometimes you have to

436
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,159
employ covers fabric covers that allow

437
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,919
them to breathe and you should do that

438
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,570
for a home compost pile as well but

439
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,669
sometimes in the summer I want to trap

440
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:13,909
the moisture inside so I don't have to

441
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:15,919
artificially add moisture coming in with

442
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,590
a some type of a water wagon or

443
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,259
something else but creating those ratios

444
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:22,129
in the beginning and getting that down

445
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:25,609
is critical

446
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:28,100
so in terms of scaling it up the

447
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:30,859
principles are still the same when I

448
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:33,349
inoculate the piles using the biodynamic

449
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,279
method I might have a windrow that's a

450
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:37,548
hundred yards long

451
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,529
but I'm dividing that wind row into

452
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:42,019
eight or ten different or twelve or

453
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:45,889
thirteen different sections so each

454
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:47,869
section is approximately for biodynamic

455
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,288
purposes I look at each section of the

456
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:54,109
wind row every seven to ten tons of wind

457
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:56,990
row is like its own unit and I want to

458
00:18:54,109 --> 00:19:00,408
knock you late that small part of the

459
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,048
pile so it's it's a long system but I

460
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:05,390
think of it as all these little batches

461
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:07,460
combined much like somebody who's

462
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,470
planting cannabis you might have one

463
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,900
plant that you're treating as one plant

464
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,279
but you might have a whole row that's

465
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,419
planted in the ground

466
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:20,089
and one of the things you want to

467
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:23,750
realize is in between those plants is a

468
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:26,808
vast array of for all intents and

469
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,519
purpose biological intelligence so

470
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:30,379
oftentimes people think that you know

471
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,029
they're little drip watering systems

472
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,610
just at the base of the plant is the

473
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:36,879
most efficient way to do it and maybe

474
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:39,709
it's efficient in terms of overall water

475
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,289
but when you look at the grand scheme of

476
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:45,110
it all and really harnessing all the

477
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:47,240
life and all the power beneath the soil

478
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:50,240
that's available to you you're missing

479
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:54,159
out on a vast amount of biological

480
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,288
intelligence of biological resources and

481
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,900
nutrient resources that lie within the

482
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:01,759
soil in between those plants because

483
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,580
they do communicate with each other

484
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,819
whether you're paying attention to

485
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:09,129
or not so dividing it into sections but

486
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:12,099
really keeping an eye at the really big

487
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,680
picture is one of the important things

488
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:17,349
of scaling it up and the third variable

489
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,890
goes back to that idea of intentional

490
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:26,019
composting is selecting your materials

491
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:28,210
with meticulous care and for Malibu

492
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:30,519
compost and for biodynamics as a whole

493
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,319
it all starts with the cow and we can go

494
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,210
into a hundred of different reasons with

495
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,329
that and that kind of goes into that

496
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:40,650
microbe and the bio regions but we're

497
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:45,309
looking at a clean grass-fed organic

498
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:50,019
dairy cow manure and having that rich

499
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:52,119
manure blended with the proper carbon

500
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:54,099
materials to be able to have a good

501
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:57,459
carbon nitrogen ratio to start the

502
00:20:54,099 --> 00:21:00,789
composting process and blend it in such

503
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:03,250
a way that we can pile it up where it's

504
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:05,980
homogenous enough to be able to have an

505
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,400
even controlled biological breakdown and

506
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,529
not end up if it starts with chunks of

507
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,990
hay and chunks of manure and chunks of

508
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:19,589
this often times you're gonna end up

509
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:22,059
with a wide variation in the biological

510
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:24,459
decomposition of the pile and you'll

511
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,720
find really hot pockets and really cold

512
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,660
pockets when it comes down to

513
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:32,079
temperature so you're not having a

514
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:34,120
homogeneous even microbial controlled

515
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:37,119
breakdown which is what we're altima

516
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,889
trying to do even if we are scaling it

517
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:43,899
up right on that makes a lot of sense so

518
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:46,720
so feeding the cows grass and and

519
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,000
leaving the cows organic and not pumping

520
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,600
them full of chemicals that's fairly

521
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,130
obvious but but what is your reasoning

522
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:59,649
for specifically using dairy cows and um

523
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,360
I should preface this by saying is one

524
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,700
of the most important aspects of making

525
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,519
compost is use what's available to you

526
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,319
for all your local composters find

527
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:11,410
what's most readily available and then

528
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:13,599
work your way out and around your local

529
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,390
region in that regard

530
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,379
um for us at Malibu compost because

531
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,650
we're doing a back

532
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:24,700
agda product we really started with

533
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:27,730
working backwards from what is the most

534
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,710
valuable most superior what could we

535
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,309
think of as the best compost on earth

536
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,690
and then work backwards from that and

537
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:37,929
that's what's brought us to biodynamic

538
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,240
agriculture and there's a number of

539
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:44,019
different reasons for that but there's

540
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:48,480
something incredibly special about the

541
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:52,329
cow is the cow is a giant digestive

542
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:56,620
fermentation machine the cow it's not

543
00:22:52,329 --> 00:23:00,429
meant to run and jump the cow stands and

544
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:04,419
eats and digests and has four stomachs

545
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:06,100
and there's a 12 days of that digestive

546
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,250
process from the time that that grass

547
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:11,139
enters the cows cud and starts chewing -

548
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,690
whether it comes out the other end so

549
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,600
there's all this fermentation in these

550
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:21,279
enzyme in these bacteria but the cow

551
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:24,849
itself and you see this now as research

552
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:27,039
is coming out grass-fed dairy cow also

553
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:30,039
produced specific compounds one of them

554
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,659
clas are conjugated linoleic acids and

555
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,339
you'd have to ask somebody who's much

556
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,090
more of a chemist than I to really break

557
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:40,569
that into it but there's a link and

558
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:45,730
really what it comes down to is you need

559
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:47,799
high quality soil to create plants and

560
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,870
if you have high quality healthy plants

561
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:53,049
that are deriving their mineral

562
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:56,229
nutrition from the soil in the air this

563
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:59,259
builds a high functional immunity in the

564
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:02,559
plants and plants that are strong and

565
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:05,950
have strong immunity and strong immune

566
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:09,720
systems that then gets transferred to us

567
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:12,640
as humans in the form of food so it

568
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,279
sounds pretty simple but eating healthy

569
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,550
food from healthy plants creates healthy

570
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:22,149
people and that all starts with the

571
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:24,220
health of the soil so dad kind of backs

572
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:27,310
up to what goes in the soil and what

573
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,500
we've seen is that the cow it's not just

574
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:30,879
the digestive process but the cow is

575
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,170
eating grass

576
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,570
it's eating local grasses that are grown

577
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:40,029
specific to this area and we can get

578
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:42,369
into Allan savory and rangeland

579
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:44,049
management and grass management and

580
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:46,419
that's probably a whole nother show for

581
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:48,970
you if you haven't had one already and I

582
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,640
direct people to acres USA and a lot of

583
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:54,490
other resources that look at no-till and

584
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,750
grazing and pasture management but they

585
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,420
all have something in common which is

586
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:01,690
all these perennial grasses all these

587
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,250
local grasses that are indigenous to

588
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,870
different climates you can find a

589
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,119
hundred different grass types in the

590
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:10,209
field and you might find some weeds that

591
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,849
are in there often considered weeds but

592
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,340
they might be performing a specific

593
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:21,959
function to create balance in that soil

594
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:26,349
and so a cow all out on grass is is

595
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:29,680
processing biological material that's

596
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:32,009
specific to that locale it's those local

597
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,170
indigenous grasses and pasture grasses

598
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:37,299
that are passing through the cow coming

599
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:41,920
out the other end and fertilizing that

600
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:44,950
pasture and nature knows what it needs

601
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,220
and Nature has this incredible symbiotic

602
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:51,880
way of balancing itself out if and when

603
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,500
given the chance and so while it might

604
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,590
sound like a stretch of the imagination

605
00:25:53,500 --> 00:26:00,609
I would say I would go so far as to say

606
00:25:56,589 --> 00:26:04,359
that the cows digestive system has

607
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:07,269
almost a perception if you will of what

608
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:10,029
that grass and that pasture needs for

609
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:12,639
fertility and between the grasses that

610
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:16,240
it's grazing on and the manure that's

611
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,220
coming out the other end and up to 25%

612
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,339
of that manure could be considered

613
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,319
microbes it's passing on the same

614
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:26,349
fertility that's needed to keep in

615
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:29,859
balance and continually improve those

616
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:32,709
pastures so that's what we're after in

617
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:35,589
that dairy cow manure is all of those

618
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:40,110
microbes is all of that balance is all

619
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:44,279
that processing of those living native

620
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:48,209
annuals and perennials and those grasses

621
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:50,490
that are just growing in harmony with

622
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,700
the soil underneath and because of the

623
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:56,190
nature the dairy cow industry not all

624
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,620
dairies are because of land are able to

625
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:01,580
grow all the forage that they need and

626
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:04,649
so they end up often having much more

627
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:06,929
pasture land than they can for food and

628
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,540
so if they're not growing all their own

629
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:12,240
food on-site oftentimes they have land

630
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:13,649
close by you know both of our farms that

631
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,769
we work with in California and Oregon

632
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,810
have off-site hay pastures so they grow

633
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:20,279
their own hay still vertically

634
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,349
integrated they just do it a couple

635
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:26,250
hours away because the value of real

636
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:28,679
estate obviously but what we find there

637
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,569
is still by controlling those variables

638
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,519
they're not getting hay that's imported

639
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:34,889
from hundreds of miles away or from

640
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,629
different states that who knows what it

641
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:41,250
has in it but you're really controlling

642
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:45,590
this microbial population in different

643
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:48,930
regions that are gonna have their own

644
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:51,559
positive affect not only on the soil but

645
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:54,360
it goes then also into the plant and

646
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:57,149
plants that have a stronger native soil

647
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:59,250
have stronger indigenous microorganisms

648
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,620
they're able to build a stronger immune

649
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,049
system and it's you know much like

650
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,969
humans that are able to do well in an

651
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,769
area where you grew up or we see this

652
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,319
with different cultures different

653
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:12,119
cultural phenomenon it's the same kind

654
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,359
of function of building that immunity

655
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:17,819
and building that plant health through

656
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,649
building the soil health so in our in

657
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:22,829
our second set we're gonna talk a lot

658
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:25,470
more about local microbes but but but as

659
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:27,899
we wrap up this first set I was curious

660
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:32,400
you know I'm it - not knowing a lot

661
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,690
about cows actually at all but but you

662
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,920
always when you talk about you talk

663
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:40,140
about dairy cows thus excluding meat

664
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,240
cows and I always wondered was there

665
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,540
something about the biology of a dairy

666
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,640
cow and that the cow is you know at a

667
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,460
part of her life that she's giving off

668
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,700
milk does that add some kind of

669
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,890
fertility to her output in and of itself

670
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,360
just because she's at that stage in her

671
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,490
life

672
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:01,479
exactly

673
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:04,990
once a cow has given birth and is

674
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,360
producing milk through that lactation

675
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:11,798
cycle there's a whole different set of

676
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:14,408
enzymes that become presence in the

677
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:16,808
cow's rumen and in the cow's die jet in

678
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:19,120
the cow's cut really it starts in the

679
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:22,450
cow's mouth as they're chewing those

680
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:26,709
grasses and so that's passed on and we

681
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:29,200
see you know the the fatty acids and the

682
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,179
milk content and we're able to analyze

683
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,630
all these different compounds in milk

684
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:37,059
now and we can see through the growth of

685
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:39,669
probiotics and utilizing raw grass-fed

686
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:41,918
dairy cow milk for making cultures and

687
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:44,169
making labs and all sorts of I mean you

688
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,299
can just do an experiment with

689
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:48,880
store-bought milk and with organic milk

690
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:51,548
and with raw milk and you know you can

691
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,000
see the difference in its ability to go

692
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:57,250
through you know that process and that's

693
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,579
really a reflection of what's in there

694
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,558
so that mother dairy cow has these

695
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:03,788
different enzymes that are produced and

696
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,710
we're looking for the same kind of

697
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:07,990
probiotic elements if you will coming

698
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,210
out one end of the cow that's coming out

699
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,460
in the form of the milk of the cow now

700
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:15,370
that's not to say that there's a lot of

701
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:18,548
benefits to the male cow's butt and you

702
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:21,398
see that because an organic male cow

703
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:25,259
would be considered out on grass would

704
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:27,939
be grass-fed beef and grass-fed beef

705
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:30,278
still contains a lot of those same

706
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,019
conjugated linoleic acids that you find

707
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:34,720
in dairy products and these are

708
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:37,179
compounds the body just doesn't produce

709
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,730
them they we need them but the body just

710
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:41,110
doesn't produce them and so this is one

711
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,259
of the ways that you're able to get it

712
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:46,028
and that same kind of fertility it's not

713
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:49,569
necessarily in the composting process

714
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:52,359
but I would encourage your listeners to

715
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:54,519
take a look at the Marin carbon project

716
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:58,178
and the work of John wick down in Marin

717
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:01,929
with restoring the rangelands but we've

718
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:05,620
seen that the fertility of these animals

719
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:08,139
grazing after years and years of not

720
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:11,439
grazing on rangeland that has been dead

721
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:14,939
you know has degradation year after year

722
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,000
one summer of these cows grazing

723
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:22,600
reverses the degradation of the land and

724
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,170
it starts a carbon sequestration cycle

725
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:28,299
through one application of compost

726
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:31,300
furthermore native perennials start

727
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:33,879
coming back and the cows pick up weight

728
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:36,059
and over the summer months they become

729
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,950
much more lush they gain weight you can

730
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:42,309
physically see the difference in the in

731
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,840
the coats of the cows but really the

732
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:47,619
most fascinating thing is what's

733
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:50,709
happening under the soil as this process

734
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:52,719
of grazing and these nutrients getting

735
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:57,039
restored to the soil are able to

736
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,710
literally reverse this problem of soil

737
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,779
degradation and sequester carbon and

738
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,600
that is one of the greatest

739
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:07,779
opportunities that we have available as

740
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:09,609
we look you know towards our future and

741
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:12,819
we look at these issues of global

742
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:15,119
warming and the amount of carbon and the

743
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:18,869
challenge of growing healthy food and

744
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:23,559
the challenge of soil degradation and

745
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:26,859
land that has been abused and soil that

746
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,909
has just died off after years and years

747
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:33,909
and years of chemical synthetic

748
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:35,440
conventional agriculture right on thank

749
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,090
you : so we're gonna take our first

750
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,039
short break and be right back you're

751
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:41,709
listening to shaping fire and my guest

752
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,829
today is Colm Riley co-founder of Malibu

753
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,299
compost now that the health benefits of

754
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,460
terpenes have become well known in the

755
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,230
cannabis industry people everywhere are

756
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,210
looking for the purest terpenes without

757
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,769
adulterants the problem with most

758
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,840
terpene providers is that they're not

759
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:58,240
sourced naturally and instead are made

760
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:00,849
as a byproduct of refining petroleum and

761
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,710
that's so sketchy the terpenes sold by

762
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:05,529
true terpenes are entirely different

763
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:07,299
they are certified organic non-gmo and

764
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:09,910
food grade that means that they are

765
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:11,859
extracted from real plant sources there

766
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,930
are no solvents of any kind they are

767
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:17,259
distilled only with steam that's right

768
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:18,940
only steam in fact terpenes from true

769
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:21,220
turbines are so pure that you can eat

770
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,529
them not only that but you can stack

771
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,860
them with better results - what I mean

772
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:25,298
is

773
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:27,339
other companies turbine

774
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:29,200
have got a few percent of impurities and

775
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:31,269
when you stack those terpenes to make

776
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,069
your blend you're adding a variety of

777
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,769
impurities that degrade your final

778
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:37,689
product true terpenes also have strange

779
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:39,519
specific terpenes for a wide range of

780
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,879
cannabis strains like Durbin poison

781
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,829

newsletter using pesticides when growing

804
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:38,739
cannabis has been common for a long time

805
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:41,078
nowadays though we know better we know

806
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:42,729
that most pesticides formulated for food

807
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,950
crops have never been tested for use

808
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,378
with cannabis they've been tested to be

809
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,598
eaten in tiny doses they have not been

810
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:51,719
tested to be inhaled and especially not

811
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,068
concentrated into a cannabis oil

812
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:55,808
chemical residues from pesticides are

813
00:34:54,068 --> 00:34:58,329
not healthy for anyone but they are

814
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:59,950
especially dangerous for patients for

815
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:02,260
commercial cannabis growers this has

816
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:04,029
become very impactful cannabis

817
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,670
enthusiasts and patients have gotten

818
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,640
educated enough that they avoid growers

819
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:11,260
who used pesticides not only that but

820
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:13,568
states across the country have begun

821
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:17,109
making pesticide testing mandatory on

822
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:18,608
all licensed cannabis crops the time has

823
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:20,739
come to find a better way to fight

824
00:35:18,608 --> 00:35:22,630
garden pests than covering your cannabis

825
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:26,729
and chemicals and there is a better way

826
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:29,079
let some good bugs fight your bad bugs

827
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,880
beneficial insects and predatory mites

828
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:33,160
have come a long way since we were

829
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,108
buying ladybugs online and putting them

830
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:38,739
in the grow room and just hoping for the

831
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:40,989
best natural enemies bio control

832
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:44,049
can help you solve pest issues without

833
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:46,719
using chemicals natural enemies founder

834
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:48,670
Shane young learned best practices from

835
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,179
working in the ornamental plant industry

836
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:54,010
and has fine-tuned those strategies

837
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:56,169
specifically for large cannabis crops

838
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,119
Shane works with commercial cannabis

839
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,550
clients across the country to ensure

840
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:03,030
that they keep their crop safe and pest

841
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:06,220
free without the use of chemicals

842

Shango Louis and our guest this week is

853
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:37,950
Colm Riley co-founder of Malibu compost

854
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:42,190
so before the break we learned

855
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:45,519
soup-to-nuts about how compost is made

856
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,500
why it's regenerative and how to scale

857
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,509
it up but one of the important things

858
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:53,409
that you continually point out column is

859
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:55,270
the use of local microbes and this you

860
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:57,759
know is in contrast to the idea that

861
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:59,349
that compost can be made somewhere on

862
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,970
the other side of the country and then

863
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:03,700
it gets shipped to you on pallets and

864
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:06,608
then you use it locally expecting it to

865
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:09,699
keep your cannabis plants alive when the

866
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:11,440
food is actually from somewhere else so

867
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:13,358
you know it really kind of blew my mind

868
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,240
when you were talking in San Francisco

869
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:18,098
and Indo Expo about these micro bio

870
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,009
regions and the importance of

871
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:22,900
incorporating local microbes in cannabis

872
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,310
horticulture will you go through that

873
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,380
line of thought for us a little bit

874
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:29,588
right now in the in the difference I

875
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,050
guess I mean the diversity of local

876
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:34,838
microbes and why we want to make sure

877
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,670
that we capture and use those local

878
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:40,779
microbes in our soil for growing

879
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:43,809
cannabis sure and I guess there's to say

880
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:46,630
I suddenly got hit over the head with

881
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:48,969
the bat of eco guilt because our compost

882
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:52,329
does ship to other places and people do

883
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:54,219
use it but that's why

884
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:57,579
flying out at about midnight tonight

885
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:59,619
back to Pennsylvania to get to work

886
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:02,199
again on our first wind rows that we're

887
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:04,150
making in Pennsylvania congratulations

888
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:05,919
on that exciting as it is to ship

889
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,380
compost to Pennsylvania I think it's

890
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,119
much more important to make the compost

891
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,170
in Pennsylvania and then have it

892
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:16,359
available there so certainly sometimes

893
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,519
you know something can still work and

894
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,370
the things work on a nutritional and a

895
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:26,829
biological level but yeah there's this

896
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:29,920
question of local and uh I guess one way

897
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:34,989
to explain it would be if you think of

898
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:37,389
microbes as almost livestock of the soil

899
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:39,729
think of all the same kind of

900
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:43,029
biodiversity that we have above-ground

901
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:47,639
in our forests and our plains and our

902
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:50,769
wooded areas think of the same just

903
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,719
massive biodiversity of microbes

904
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:55,590
underneath the soil so you're gonna have

905
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,939
different types and different herds of

906
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:59,530
microbes in different areas of the

907
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,650
country because it's just different soil

908
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:05,500
types and different characteristics and

909
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,690
those have an important role to play in

910
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:13,030
those regions and have a historical role

911
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:14,829
so with the dairy cow it's we're we're

912
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:18,100
kind of cherry picking because the dairy

913
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:20,440
cow is foraging on pasture so those

914
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:22,630
pastures have different characteristics

915
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,039
in different parts of the country and I

916
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,019
would certainly say we've seen

917
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:27,940
significant differences between the

918
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:30,449
compost that we make in California and

919
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:34,480
the compost that we make in Oregon and

920
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:37,299
not to put myself down but I feel that

921
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,679
there is sort of an inherent I don't

922
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,400
necessarily want to use the word

923
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:45,069
superiority but there seems to be a much

924
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,490
higher level of energy and diversity in

925
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:50,590
the oregon compost and i believe that

926
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:52,779
has a lot to do with the fact that

927
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:57,220
because of rainfall and weather and some

928
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:59,620
other meteorological phenomenon the cows

929
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:01,959
are able to be outside and have many

930
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:04,869
many more days on pasture than their

931
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,250
california counterparts that's certainly

932
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:09,670
one of the things that you see

933
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:11,289
and the pasture management is really

934
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,670
good because of the water and the

935
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:16,599
different cycles that you're able to

936
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:21,099
have there but it's still important to

937
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,569
have locally produced composts so when

938
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:24,849
you start looking at some of the micro

939
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:29,440
bio regions just think that there's many

940
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:31,900
many different curds of microbes in

941
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,059
different areas and here on the west

942
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,280
coast from the Pacific Northwest to

943
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:38,949
Humboldt and Mendocino County right down

944
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,100
the California coast line to the redwood

945
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:48,279
forests of Santa Cruz we have an

946
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:51,789
ecosystem that's largely derived from

947
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,280
the Pacific and I always talk about this

948
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:55,150
when I'm talking about indigenous

949
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,530
microorganisms I always throw out the

950
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:00,849
question does a bear [ __ ] in the woods

951
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:02,440
and yes it does but one thing to

952
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:05,889
remember is there used to be a whole lot

953
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:09,369
more bears in these woods and what did

954
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:10,989
the Bears use to eat salmon and then

955
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:11,409
what would the Bears do [ __ ] in the

956
00:41:10,989 --> 00:41:14,259
woods

957
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:17,349
so you have this fertility that's almost

958
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:19,540
sort of ocean derived spreading itself

959
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:21,610
out in that nutrient footprint whether

960
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:24,880
it's from the birds or the bears or all

961
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:27,309
these other animals and filling all of

962
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,579
our mountain ranges along the coastal

963
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:34,000
lines and the rains come and this is one

964
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:36,610
of sort of the local nutritional

965
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,610
footprints if you will of this type of

966
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:41,019
soil so when we're talking to growers

967
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:44,890
and it doesn't matter what you're

968
00:41:41,019 --> 00:41:48,670
growing there's a significant

969
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:51,069
consideration in my mind when you start

970
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:53,789
thinking about how am I going to add

971
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,900
additional fertility to your plants and

972
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:58,960
contrary to what the chemical companies

973
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:02,170
will have you believe not all NPK is

974
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,099
created equal it's not so when you're

975
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:08,530
putting blood meal on your plants or

976
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:12,849
bone meal on your plants you might be

977
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:16,240
getting bone mil from a hog processing

978
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:18,909
facility in Arkansas run by Johnsonville

979
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,989
that you would never want to take

980
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:23,469
anything

981
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:25,809
um and you're putting on that plants

982
00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:28,679
when you have available to you shrimp

983
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:34,449
meal and kelp meal and crab meal and

984
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:36,879
kelp meal and uh fish meal and all sorts

985
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:40,480
of crustacean derived that have a much

986
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,039
more sort of localized footprint for

987
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,469
what you're doing but you find it all

988
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:46,059
around it has to do with the weeds and

989
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:49,149
the plant matter that's growing in that

990
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:53,320
soil it has to do with the forest Duff

991
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:56,800
as you said and so this is a fascinating

992
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:59,760
area where science is struggling and

993
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,910
trying to catch up and almost literally

994
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,070
invent and define this field of soil

995
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:08,349
microbiology as fast as they can and

996
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:11,200
it's one of those exciting things where

997
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:16,539
you know the science of the soil is

998
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:20,980
probably just as misunderstood or has

999
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:23,110
yet to be understood as from a geography

1000
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,179
standpoint the depths of our oceans it's

1001
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:27,070
just that area that we've never really

1002
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:29,349
hit but everything else you know we've

1003
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:31,869
been able to define so there's this kind

1004
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:34,389
of vast unknown but we know that there's

1005
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:38,950
just these different aspects of

1006
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:40,929
different areas and one thing you find

1007
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:43,289
which is interesting where science is

1008
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:47,440
still kind of trying to explain it is

1009
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:52,059
where indigenous wisdom comes into play

1010
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,800
and you know biodynamic sometimes some

1011
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:56,500
of the purists like to think okay

1012
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:01,090
biodynamics was coined by Rudolf Steiner

1013
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:04,358
in 1924 and it's the end-all be-all and

1014
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:08,380
it's not quite that way but it's not it

1015
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:10,779
was much more also a cultural scientist

1016
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,340
and he looked at what different cultures

1017
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,590
did and when you start looking at some

1018
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:17,019
of the agricultural practices of the

1019
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:21,480
Mayans or the Aztecs or different Native

1020
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:24,789
American tribes you see that there's

1021
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,980
relationships in their agricultural

1022
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:29,349
practices that have to do with the

1023
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,269
cycles of the Moon that have to do with

1024
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:33,759
the cycles of the year that have to do

1025
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:36,550
with the cycles of plants and animals

1026
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,410
and how they plant and there are

1027
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:40,030
different practices that they did

1028
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,009
sometimes they might not even really be

1029
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:44,640
able to tell you everything behind it

1030
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:47,620
other than it was just passed down and

1031
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,690
more recently I saw you at a phenomenal

1032
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:52,539
podcast talking about Korean natural

1033
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:56,619
farming techniques yeah now with Kris

1034
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:59,139
Trump yeah and so I'm sure I wasn't able

1035
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:00,670
to catch every segment of that but one

1036
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:03,460
of the things that Korean natural

1037
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:06,130
farming looks at is harnessing the power

1038
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:09,010
of these indigenous microorganisms so

1039
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:11,550
something as simple as taking a plate of

1040
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,720
steamed rice that are in a box and

1041
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,970
taking it and putting it underneath a

1042
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:18,369
tree on your property and like you

1043
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:21,399
mentioned that houmous that forest Duff

1044
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:23,289
when we say compost happens all you need

1045
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,619
to do is go stand underneath the tree

1046
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:29,519
and microscopically every hour every

1047
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:31,569
second compost is happening

1048
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,699
microorganisms that you can't even see

1049
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:36,039
are slowly falling to the ground and

1050
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:39,250
getting broken up and compost is

1051
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:42,279
happening on that forest floor every

1052
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:44,800
second of every day and so putting

1053
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,380
steamed rice out in the forest

1054
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,080
underneath the tree is all those

1055
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,390
millions of local microorganisms are

1056
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,059
landing on that rice and sticking to

1057
00:45:52,389 --> 00:45:57,639
that rice and that rice is then used as

1058
00:45:55,059 --> 00:46:00,519
a catalyst combined with plant matter

1059
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:03,219
harvested from that property filled with

1060
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:06,460
water and you doing utilizing a catalyst

1061
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:09,309
such as a lactobacillus and what that

1062
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,990
does it starts that fermentation and

1063
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:13,179
reproduction process and those

1064
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:16,209
indigenous microorganisms now are

1065
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:18,849
reproducing over and over and over again

1066
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:22,860
and replicating themselves and you're

1067
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:25,889
now building populations of

1068
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:30,250
microorganisms that are uniquely

1069
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:33,779
specific to your property and it's not

1070
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:37,989
that you're going after those indigenous

1071
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:42,100
microorganisms for NPK nutrients but

1072
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:45,189
you're really going after that health

1073
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:47,798
that vitality and that immune system in

1074
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:50,769
the plant and the stronger the plant is

1075
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:52,688
as far as its ability to not have to

1076
00:46:50,768 --> 00:46:55,358
worry and have a care in the world for

1077
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:57,399
pest and disease and other aspects it

1078
00:46:55,358 --> 00:47:00,038
can just do what it does is have this

1079
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,068
symbiotic relationship with all the life

1080
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:05,890
in the soil and having that healthy soil

1081
00:47:03,068 --> 00:47:08,498
and having this healthy approach to the

1082
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:11,139
plant is what's gonna create this

1083
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:13,688
nutrient density you know and you can

1084
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:16,298
look at a soil test and you can look at

1085
00:47:13,688 --> 00:47:19,449
a multivitamin look at the label on your

1086
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:21,009
kid's multivitamins and look at all the

1087
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:23,249
compounds that you find in your soil

1088
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:25,539
test and you're gonna see the same

1089
00:47:23,248 --> 00:47:27,698
compounds there you're gonna see zinc

1090
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:29,469
you're gonna see manganese you're gonna

1091
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:32,858
see iron you're gonna see all these

1092
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:34,929
different minerals that we look at in

1093
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:36,778
terms of human health and you're gonna

1094
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:39,848
understand that that's what's

1095
00:47:36,778 --> 00:47:41,858
transmuting into the food and all the

1096
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:43,509
secondary metabolites is really what

1097
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:45,338
we're looking at that can build not only

1098
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:48,880
just the human health and the plant

1099
00:47:45,338 --> 00:47:51,099
health but its health just beyond the

1100
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,099
nutrients that our bodies crave it's

1101
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:56,798
this added health and vitality it's the

1102
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:59,140
the ability to resist pests and disease

1103
00:47:56,798 --> 00:48:00,998
it's we see it in children that played

1104
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:03,728
in the mud or grew up on a farm they

1105
00:48:00,998 --> 00:48:06,598
just naturally are healthier and more

1106
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:09,068
resistant we don't have to look far

1107
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,079
outside away from our journals of

1108
00:48:09,068 --> 00:48:13,538
science and our journals of nature and

1109
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:15,759
our journals of everything else but the

1110
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:17,619
problem is we basically have a medical

1111
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:20,259
field in this country that knows nothing

1112
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:23,619
about nutrition and health so there's a

1113
00:48:20,259 --> 00:48:25,659
whole disconnect here you know the

1114
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:28,269
diabetes rate in this country used to be

1115
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:32,259
one for every 50,000 people now it's one

1116
00:48:28,268 --> 00:48:34,718
out of every 20 so something severely

1117
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:37,358
wrong with our soil with our plants and

1118
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:40,059
with our food and as we take this back

1119
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:42,458
to cannabis it's understanding the

1120
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:45,670
cannabis does have incredible medicinal

1121
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:48,818
properties but to me sometimes it's

1122
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:51,489
almost blows your mind for people that

1123
00:48:48,818 --> 00:48:56,009
can swear up and down the cannabis has

1124
00:48:51,489 --> 00:49:01,400
medicinal properties yet are completely

1125
00:48:56,009 --> 00:49:04,639
ignorant of the fact that the medicinal

1126
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,269
properties and value of cannabis has

1127
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:10,789
everything to do with how it's grown

1128
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:13,429
you're not gonna stick a cannabis plant

1129
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:16,130
in a bunch of rockwool and dump a bottle

1130
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:18,679
just bottle after bottle of bottle after

1131
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:20,630
nutrients synthetic nutrients and then

1132
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:23,779
say oh but the cannabis is is its

1133
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:27,530
medicinal you know it's it it's

1134
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:30,740
medicinal it's it's you know I mean

1135
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:32,810
that's like saying a steering wheel has

1136
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:34,819
the ability to drive you down the

1137
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:36,710
freeway from Seattle to Portland it

1138
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:40,160
doesn't you need the car that's attached

1139
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:45,470
to it so it's it's it's one aspect of it

1140
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:47,389
but to ignore that aspect of it is kind

1141
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:51,709
of doing the same disservice that all of

1142
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:54,409
us are trying to overcome and really be

1143
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:56,059
a part of the solution of what's wrong

1144
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:58,369
with our food system and our

1145
00:49:56,059 --> 00:50:00,199
agricultural system and not be part of

1146
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:02,989
the problem that really takes the whole

1147
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:04,969
idea of whole plant medical cannabis to

1148
00:50:02,989 --> 00:50:07,119
a to a whole nother level not only are

1149
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:09,919
you talking about all the cannabinoid

1150
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:13,190
constituents but also the the entire

1151
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,230
life and micronutrients of the plants

1152
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:17,750
and you know you know one of the things

1153
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,679
that always Curie not always I believe I

1154
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,239
don't when really didn't think about

1155
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:21,319
this for about a year but one of the

1156
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,199
things I've been curious about for the

1157
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:29,269
last year is that um with these local

1158
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:31,399
microbes does it make sense to only use

1159
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:33,559
your local microbes I would think that

1160
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:37,190
since everywhere in the United States

1161
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:40,549
pretty much plants are growing that you

1162
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:44,059
should have a complete set of the

1163
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:46,970
necessary microbes where you live and

1164
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:49,070
not necessarily have to bring them from

1165
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:50,899
somewhere else I mean perhaps you want

1166
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:54,019
to ship yourself a higher quality

1167
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,849
compost that's one thing but but when I

1168
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:58,099
first started thinking about microbes I

1169
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:00,980
was thinking oh well if I were to order

1170
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:03,259
a compost say from Oklahoma where it's

1171
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,389
certainly more dry and the soil has a

1172
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:07,220
different composition than where I live

1173
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:09,469
in the Pacific Northwest so I order a

1174
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:11,629
bag there and I bring it here and the

1175
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:13,469
microbes that would come with it you

1176
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:16,519
know there used to a dryer and

1177
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:19,559
they're not used to these tepid winters

1178
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:21,659
they're there they're built for a

1179
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:24,210
different environment and I'm thinking

1180
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:28,259
you know they very well might not do

1181
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:29,699
well in my soil here but then what if

1182
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,380
there's something that's missing I mean

1183
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:33,569
probably where I live in the Pacific

1184
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,608
Northwest I probably have got a full set

1185
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:37,530
of microbes but I can imagine that there

1186
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:40,319
might be parts of the country that are

1187
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:42,300
so where the soil is so stripped that

1188
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,309
they really need to need to import

1189
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,619
microbes from somewhere else because

1190
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:50,358
their own soil is lacking is there is

1191
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:50,358
there any truth or possibility to that

1192
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:56,609
yes I think so and this might be an area

1193
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:58,920
where people that are far more

1194
00:51:56,608 --> 00:52:02,039
knowledgeable on specific microbial

1195
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:04,829
inoculations than I could speak better

1196
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:07,139
to that but I'll throw out a couple

1197
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:09,509
examples I have a very close family

1198
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:11,309
friend and agricultural friend that we

1199
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,950
work together as a biodynamic vineyard

1200
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:15,840
consultants and he's worked all over he

1201
00:52:13,949 --> 00:52:17,960
honed his craft in France and he's been

1202
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:21,000
all over top vineyards on the west coast

1203
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:24,300
he's utilized some microbial inoculants

1204
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,400
on some vineyards down in the Central

1205
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:29,820
Coast of California sort of down Sandeen

1206
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:34,170
as type area and one of the things that

1207
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:38,269
he told me was adding a microbial

1208
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:41,338
inoculant what he noticed and you know

1209
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:44,159
it's not as scientifically rigorous so

1210
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:45,539
please don't question my numbers but he

1211
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,338
said something like it looked like

1212
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:53,519
something like after taking samples

1213
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:57,838
something like 60% of the microbes that

1214
00:52:53,519 --> 00:53:00,929
had been added died off that they just

1215
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:03,480
they weren't they couldn't thrive in

1216
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:06,868
that environment but what they also

1217
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,329
noticed was it had a detrimental effect

1218
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:11,099
on a lot of the indigenous

1219
00:53:08,329 --> 00:53:14,069
microorganisms so when something gets

1220
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:16,440
introduced it can out-compete your

1221
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:20,130
you're creating something completely out

1222
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:24,050
of balance so I just saw the headline

1223
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:26,039
yesterday that what they said like

1224
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:29,950
30,000

1225
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:32,289
factory farmed salmon escaped from their

1226
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:34,480
free pens up in Newfoundland and now are

1227
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:35,980
like swimming around the ocean and they

1228
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,719
didn't notice this they didn't tell

1229
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,750
anybody that there was a hole in the net

1230
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:42,399
and only happened when local fishermen

1231
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,559
started catching these salmon the timber

1232
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,910
like these aren't our normal salmon and

1233
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:50,349
so they create these factory farms

1234
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:50,949
salmon and they stick these pens out in

1235
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:53,680
the ocean

1236
00:53:50,949 --> 00:53:55,719
but they're highly you know all the fish

1237
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,730
are combined in one small area so

1238
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:59,799
they're much more prone to picking up

1239
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:01,210
certain diseases and then they escape

1240
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,119
through the net and now all of a sudden

1241
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:06,099
they're out roaming about and they can

1242
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:07,599
out-compete they can create they can

1243
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:11,260
just create all these different

1244
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:12,250
imbalances so going back to the soil you

1245
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,859
can have different microbial

1246
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:17,019
inoculations but there's the question of

1247
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:19,059
are they gonna survive and thrive in a

1248
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:20,380
new climate and what's the effect and

1249
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:22,029
impact that they're gonna have on the

1250
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,220
local indigenous microorganism

1251
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:27,519
populations so one of the things you're

1252
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:32,199
after is a lot of diversity and there's

1253
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:34,210
no there's no one silver bullet and I

1254
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:37,838
wouldn't tell somebody in Pennsylvania

1255
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:40,420
or Maine or Oklahoma or anywhere else to

1256
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:44,230
just buy a bag of Malibu and that's it

1257
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:46,450
even in Oregon and in California we're

1258
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:48,460
telling our much larger customers people

1259
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:50,769
that want several truckloads of compost

1260
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:52,900
for their for their vineyard or for

1261
00:54:50,769 --> 00:54:55,449
their orchard or for their cannabis grow

1262
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,608
is if you're getting a larger amount of

1263
00:54:55,449 --> 00:54:59,949
compost and we can work with you bring

1264
00:54:57,608 --> 00:55:02,289
me some of your own on-site compost

1265
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:05,199
bring me some of your topsoil let's bury

1266
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:07,210
that in the compost pile while it's

1267
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:11,649
cooking while it's simmering while it's

1268
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:14,380
going through this heated process and so

1269
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:17,139
we can introduce those microbes right

1270
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,970
from your property into the larger thing

1271
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:20,679
and have them sort of work out their

1272
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:22,899
issues and figure out a way to get along

1273
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:24,429
and reproduce before they even you know

1274
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,230
so that way they can kind of hit the

1275
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:27,608
ground running for for a lack of a

1276
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:29,588
better way to put it that's so long

1277
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:32,289
necks that's so next level compost

1278
00:55:29,588 --> 00:55:33,849
column I mean I mean the idea that you

1279
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:36,009
would have this thought out to such

1280
00:55:33,849 --> 00:55:39,700
degree that that you're going to

1281
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:42,130
actually inoculate your I'll

1282
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:45,489
you know custom off-the-shelf compost

1283
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:48,490
with their inoculant from the locality

1284
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:50,889
you know if it's actually exciting to

1285
00:55:48,489 --> 00:55:53,559
know that somebody's even bothering to

1286
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:55,539
do that because I think so many of the

1287
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:57,759
growers who are listening you know

1288
00:55:55,539 --> 00:55:59,380
that's what that's that's what's in

1289
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,599
their heart you know what I mean and the

1290
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,269
fact that you are able to do it at a

1291
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:07,180
commercial level it's invigorating you

1292
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:08,949
know it's exciting it's super exciting

1293
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:12,069
and where I really would say you know

1294
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:15,039
the proof is in the poop is this is

1295
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:17,859
where compost teas become so exciting

1296
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:21,460
and so this is a way that somebody can

1297
00:56:17,858 --> 00:56:24,219
capture some of that diversity and some

1298
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,990
of all these amazing benefits that we're

1299
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:28,569
talking about between the cow and the

1300
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:30,639
digestive system and the microbial

1301
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:33,609
diversity and then still get it out onto

1302
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:34,088
their property and um there was a minute

1303
00:56:33,608 --> 00:56:38,409
gentlemen

1304
00:56:34,088 --> 00:56:40,900
Alex pote Alinsky who's in Australia and

1305
00:56:38,409 --> 00:56:43,088
you can now read about the pote alinsky

1306
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:46,329
method but Alec Spode Alinsky followed

1307
00:56:43,088 --> 00:56:48,250
by a dynamics and Australia was just

1308
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:50,318
getting devastated by this growth of

1309
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,400
commercial synthetic agriculture and

1310
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:53,619
fields were getting more and more

1311
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,059
degraded and he followed by a dynamics

1312
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:56,588
and he saw this and the cow and

1313
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:58,719
everything but he realized we don't have

1314
00:56:56,588 --> 00:57:01,119
cows we got some kangaroo poop running

1315
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:04,118
around here but like there's not the

1316
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:06,880
same massive amount of herds of cows in

1317
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:10,329
Australia that there are in in you know

1318
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,640
the United States and Europe and so what

1319
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:15,849
he did then was realize is we needed to

1320
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:18,789
make sort of a compost catalyst from the

1321
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:20,619
cow and so that's the preparation that

1322
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:22,869
you see that there's stuffed and the cow

1323
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:25,088
horns that's buried underground and

1324
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:29,079
that's allowed to turn into this rich

1325
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:31,568
sort of houmous material but that is

1326
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:34,420
literally taking a teaspoon of that and

1327
00:57:31,568 --> 00:57:36,039
stirring it into water and diluting it

1328
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:39,460
to the point where it's treating one

1329
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:41,769
acre of land so you know you can have a

1330
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:44,858
pound of compost that's being treating

1331
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:47,489
that's treating 50 acres so we're

1332
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:52,358
talking about something on the most

1333
00:57:47,489 --> 00:57:53,629
minut and homeopathic level and as crazy

1334
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:55,630
as it sounds and

1335
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:58,160
nobody believed this guy until

1336
00:57:55,630 --> 00:58:00,680
Australian public television aired a

1337
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:01,969
special with him and then a bunch of

1338
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:05,808
people thought he was into witchcraft

1339
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:08,118
and thousands of farmers started driving

1340
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:09,890
overnight to his farm to come visit and

1341
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:14,059
figure out how could we do this as well

1342
00:58:09,889 --> 00:58:15,618
so there the proof you can see and

1343
00:58:14,059 --> 00:58:18,910
somebody will do a compost tea

1344
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:22,608
application that's only the most minut

1345
00:58:18,909 --> 00:58:24,949
introduction in small doses but we're

1346
00:58:22,608 --> 00:58:27,409
looking at creating that impulse and

1347
00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:29,358
just that small little impulse that then

1348
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:31,328
it's gonna replicate it itself and then

1349
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:34,159
replicate itself another time and

1350
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:37,068
replicated another time and so you're

1351
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:40,429
building up this health and vitality and

1352
00:58:37,068 --> 00:58:42,259
it's not a one size fits all massive

1353
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:46,068
approach but you're going over it so no

1354
00:58:42,259 --> 00:58:48,048
matter where you are in bio dynamics I

1355
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:50,960
always say you always want to add your

1356
00:58:48,048 --> 00:58:53,298
own topsoil or clay or something into

1357
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,849
your compost during that process so

1358
00:58:53,298 --> 00:58:59,630
while it's undergoing this

1359
00:58:54,849 --> 00:59:02,809
transformation you have that spectral

1360
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:05,838
profile if you will of your soil and

1361
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:07,400
your indigenous microorganisms add it

1362
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:09,558
into the soil if you're purchasing

1363
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,660
Malibu compost or any other soil for

1364
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:13,759
that matter you should be looking to

1365
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:15,798
maybe you don't have much of your own

1366
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:17,778
compost but anything that you can have

1367
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:20,088
on-site maybe even you make a tea out of

1368
00:59:17,778 --> 00:59:22,119
what you have and you're spraying that

1369
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:25,308
onto the compost that you can use but

1370
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:27,650
regardless one to join forces with the

1371
00:59:25,309 --> 00:59:30,109
other and the earlier in that sort of

1372
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:32,358
process that that can take place the

1373
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:34,788
better if you can add something into

1374
00:59:32,358 --> 00:59:37,880
your compost pile or into my compost

1375
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:41,569
file of yours while it's simmering and

1376
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:45,259
cooking you're you're allowing a lot of

1377
00:59:41,568 --> 00:59:47,298
those issues that suddenly can result

1378
00:59:45,259 --> 00:59:49,639
from a shock type thing just think about

1379
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:54,409
you know transplant shock for example

1380
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:56,389
and you're mitigating that by creating

1381
00:59:54,409 --> 00:59:58,129
something that can kind of work out

1382
00:59:56,389 --> 01:00:00,679
their issues and then get to this point

1383
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:03,048
of harmony and synergy before you're

1384
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:05,389
introducing you know plants as living

1385
01:00:03,048 --> 01:00:07,259
organisms into a chaotic environment

1386
01:00:05,389 --> 01:00:11,250
rather it's an

1387
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:13,320
that's just thriving and you know ready

1388

back you are listening to shaping fire

1479
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:42,220
I'm your host Shango louse and our guest

1480
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:45,579
this week is colum Riley he's co-founder

1481
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:48,038
of Malibu compost so now that we've got

1482
01:03:45,579 --> 01:03:50,680
everybody all excited about compost

1483
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:53,220
wanting to make their own wanting to you

1484
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:56,348
know have wild harvest local microbes

1485
01:03:53,219 --> 01:04:00,368
let's talk a bit about the applications

1486
01:03:56,349 --> 01:04:01,420
for compost both you know some typical

1487
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:03,760
stuff that we're gonna see in

1488
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:06,130
horticulture but also some of the new

1489
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,289
kind of groundbreaking applications that

1490
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:11,829
we're seeing so so why don't we start at

1491
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:13,569
the top colum and hit each of these for

1492
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:15,269
a little bit so so tell us a little bit

1493
01:04:13,568 --> 01:04:18,219
about compost tea

1494
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:20,639
well compost tea is incredibly exciting

1495
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:23,469
and I'm sure you've had plenty of

1496
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:25,328
podcasts and guests who are experts in

1497
01:04:23,469 --> 01:04:28,959
that area I certainly wouldn't claim to

1498
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:30,068
be one but there's you know I would

1499
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,588
guess I would point out there's a

1500
01:04:30,068 --> 01:04:33,739
distinction between a compost tea which

1501
01:04:32,588 --> 01:04:36,880
is considered something the

1502
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:41,629
actively aerated versus a compost

1503
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:44,119
compost extract and there's you know a

1504
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:45,470
lot of debate on different sides there's

1505
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:47,059
you know a lot of people that are

1506
01:04:45,469 --> 01:04:49,399
fiercely into the actively aerated

1507
01:04:47,059 --> 01:04:53,750
compost teas on the Elaine Ingham side

1508
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:58,010
um I've you know heard then read some

1509
01:04:53,750 --> 01:05:00,139
stuff that Scott is working on at where

1510
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:03,380
he's looking a lot more towards extracts

1511
01:05:00,139 --> 01:05:06,529
and what that does but um the

1512
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:08,450
fundamental ideas well back it up even

1513
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:11,060
more when I talk about compost tea we

1514
01:05:08,449 --> 01:05:13,939
put together a very very rudimentary

1515
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:16,460
sort of I call it the gateway drug to

1516
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:18,500
compost tea is our little Malibu compost

1517
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:20,990
tea bags they're available on Amazon and

1518
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,610
most of your local stores but it's a you

1519
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:24,939
know quarter pound of compost and a

1520
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:27,710
little cotton baggie it's all dried out

1521
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:29,119
and you soak it in five gallons of water

1522
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:32,990
and you put it on your plants the next

1523
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:35,720
day so I did not use the word aerate

1524
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:37,489
there and I didn't use it because

1525
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:38,868
technically if you soak it and squeeze

1526
01:05:37,489 --> 01:05:40,459
it out and put it on your plants the

1527
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:44,180
next day it's considered a Coldwater

1528
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:46,579
compost tea extract by the compost tea

1529
01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:47,929
definitions but you could put an

1530
01:05:46,579 --> 01:05:50,090
airstone in it and you can put your

1531
01:05:47,929 --> 01:05:52,608
bubbler in it and you can brew a compost

1532
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:54,680
tea where all these microorganisms are

1533
01:05:52,608 --> 01:05:58,190
reproducing you know millions and

1534
01:05:54,679 --> 01:06:00,279
millions of times over so there's

1535
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:03,559
different aspects of compost teas

1536
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:05,390
there's different recipes for compost

1537
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:07,460
teas and the things that you can use but

1538
01:06:05,389 --> 01:06:09,949
I also find really exciting how you can

1539
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:13,059
use compost teas so whether it's an

1540
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:15,710
extract or actively aerated compost teas

1541
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:17,449
most people look at brewing a compost

1542
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:18,858
tea but then watering it into the soil

1543
01:06:17,449 --> 01:06:20,659
and that's great because you're getting

1544
01:06:18,858 --> 01:06:22,069
the nutrients the minerals the trace

1545
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:24,589
minerals but really what we're looking

1546
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:26,809
at is all that beneficial bacteria and

1547
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:28,700
fungi and we want the beneficial guys to

1548
01:06:26,809 --> 01:06:32,239
out-compete the harmful guys that's

1549
01:06:28,699 --> 01:06:34,159
really what we're looking at um one of

1550
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:36,079
the most common applications of compost

1551
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:38,629
teas that you'll read and hear about is

1552
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,400
adding it as a foliar spray so if you're

1553
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:43,010
spraying it on the underside of the

1554
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,050
leaves where the plants stomata is it's

1555
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:46,880
able to take it up through the stomata

1556
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:47,650
right into the plant the way that I

1557
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,440
think that

1558
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:52,720
it's like a quick fix it's sort of like

1559
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,760
a quick has to go right into the plants

1560
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:56,259
immune system so all those beneficials

1561
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,780
are able to go right through the stomata

1562
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:02,080
into the plants immune system as opposed

1563
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:03,970
to having to go through the soil compete

1564
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,380
in the soil make their way up through

1565
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:07,689
the root system and out to the leaves

1566
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,670
and and things like that

1567
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:12,099
so you're spraying it right on to the

1568
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:14,500
leaves you want to be careful that it

1569
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:16,150
has smaller particles because the

1570
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,280
smaller the particles the greater the

1571
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:20,559
surface area the easier the plant can

1572
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:23,200
absorb it but you don't want to use some

1573
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:26,139
of these battery-powered super you know

1574
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:27,909
atomizers because sometimes the force

1575
01:07:26,139 --> 01:07:29,829
with which you spray it can kill the

1576
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:34,449
very microbes that you've spent all this

1577
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:36,489
time to breed and to diversify I think

1578
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:39,399
it's really exciting when you see tree

1579
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:43,119
surgeons and tree care people that will

1580
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:45,700
have these like ten foot long syringes

1581
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:48,609
if you will and they're injecting

1582
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:53,349
compost tea down into the root system of

1583
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:58,570
trees as a way to balance out and add

1584
01:07:53,349 --> 01:08:00,130
more benefits to the overall it's sort

1585
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:02,950
of just like a quick fix of being able

1586
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:07,000
to treat the teas but one of the things

1587
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:08,679
I always tell people is I'm typically

1588
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,480
not a huge fan and again I'm not an

1589
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:13,359
expert so somebody can correct me but

1590
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:16,060
I'm not a huge fan of brewing further

1591
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,920
than 24 hours because I just feel

1592
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,090
inherently like once you get to the

1593
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,539
point where you have to start

1594
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:25,270
introducing bacterial foods and fungal

1595
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:27,640
foods and microbial foods once you get

1596
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:30,640
to that point you're almost introducing

1597
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:32,680
a level of competition and different

1598
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,480
microbes may or may not have preference

1599
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:37,150
for different types of food sources so

1600
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:40,679
once you've blended all your ingredients

1601
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:44,859
and you've created all this diversity by

1602
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:47,020
simply adding molasses for example you

1603
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:48,789
seem to almost now be source selecting

1604
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:51,670
which microbes are gonna do better and

1605
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:52,750
which microbes are gonna do worse and

1606
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:55,659
are gonna thrive in different

1607
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:57,369
competitive environments so you know

1608
01:08:55,659 --> 01:09:00,819
I'll leave that to other people in terms

1609
01:08:57,369 --> 01:09:01,359
of overall teas and approaches um but

1610
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:03,759
just

1611
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:08,409
sheer results that people see with T's

1612
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:10,390
are I mean that's the proof and you know

1613
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:11,800
when we sell an expensive compost that

1614
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:14,230
people can add to build your soil

1615
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:16,390
biology and people use it and they

1616
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:18,849
carefully pay attention and then they

1617
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:21,310
tell us how great it is but it takes a

1618
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:22,690
little while but the beauty of compost

1619
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:24,970
tea is people will put it on their

1620
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:27,129
plants and they'll call you immediately

1621
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:29,650
and they see the color green change and

1622
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:32,319
they see the leaves turn towards the sky

1623
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:34,420
and start praying upwards and they they

1624
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,819
see and they feel these physical

1625
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,920
tangible results and that's what gets

1626
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:41,289
them excited and so there's so much more

1627
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:43,750
you can do in terms of building your

1628
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:47,619
recipes with teas and how you use the

1629
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:49,720
teas and how you're just adding this

1630
01:09:47,619 --> 01:09:51,670
thing where something's you're using a

1631
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:54,070
principle of frequency as opposed to

1632
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:56,170
quantity and it's creating these small

1633
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:58,960
little impulses but just giving nature

1634
01:09:56,170 --> 01:10:00,850
the tools that it needs to nudge it in

1635
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,369
that right direction and just keep that

1636
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:05,950
health and vitality in your soil and in

1637
01:10:03,369 --> 01:10:08,649
your plants I like that frequency versus

1638
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:10,569
quantity so you know let's also talk

1639
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:12,849
briefly about soil amendments because

1640
01:10:10,569 --> 01:10:15,309
you know pretty much all of the the

1641
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:18,550
healthy probiotic stuff that you just

1642
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:23,020
said about compost tea will also cross

1643
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:27,159
apply to just simply taking some compost

1644
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:29,230
and mixing it in with your soil but

1645
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:31,479
often I you know hear from people you

1646
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:34,959
don't want to just use compost because

1647
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:37,750
it may even somehow be too potent so

1648
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,159
when you're recommending compost as a

1649
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:41,130
soil amendment

1650
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:44,470
how much do you recommend people go with

1651
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:47,890
um if you're using a well balanced

1652
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:49,960
compost um you know typically you could

1653
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:52,990
go anywhere up to 25 percent of your

1654
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:55,569
soil may be as high as 30 percent of

1655
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:57,719
your soil mix but you're gonna need

1656
01:10:55,569 --> 01:11:00,699
aeration you're gonna want some local

1657
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:04,449
you know like a more of a top soil type

1658
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:07,960
of blend for people who are in

1659
01:11:04,449 --> 01:11:11,500
containers you know I mean we see people

1660
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:14,800
use like 1/3 perlite 1/3 peat 1/3 Malibu

1661
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:18,100
and call it a day yeah we

1662
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:20,770
with that but you compost also has a

1663
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:22,780
higher bulk density means it has less

1664
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:24,760
free airspace so you don't want

1665
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:26,800
something and as you add more water it's

1666
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,560
gonna gradually get eaten up taken down

1667
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,060
by the plants and create more compaction

1668
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,940
so you don't want to have too much

1669
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:36,880
compost in your mix without having the

1670
01:11:33,939 --> 01:11:38,919
proper aeration but really it kind of

1671
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,529
depends on what type of cut you know if

1672
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,730
you're getting something that's and

1673
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:44,409
sometimes often it's things that aren't

1674
01:11:42,729 --> 01:11:46,539
even compost because they've changed the

1675
01:11:44,409 --> 01:11:48,939
definition now so things that used to be

1676
01:11:46,539 --> 01:11:51,970
called composted steer manure or

1677
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:54,639
composted chicken manure they used the

1678
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:57,190
word composted as a substitute for aged

1679
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,780
yeah means it was just a put in a pile

1680
01:11:57,189 --> 01:12:01,059
and just kind of got old and now they're

1681
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:02,889
calling it compost did so it's it's

1682
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:05,200
different so with things like that you

1683
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:08,350
can get a lot of different pockets a lot

1684
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:12,039
of different hot areas can burn plants

1685
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:15,900
it can lock out nutrients you can have

1686
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:18,369
some different negative effects by using

1687
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:20,229
compote you know using too much compost

1688
01:12:18,369 --> 01:12:22,599
sure but typically I'd say anywhere from

1689
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:25,629
that 10 to 25% range with what you're

1690
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:27,070
doing and keep in mind that everything's

1691
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:29,500
all about balance and whether you're

1692
01:12:27,069 --> 01:12:31,329
looking at the work of dr. Elaine Ingham

1693
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:33,760
and she's talking about balance between

1694
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:36,369
bacterial and fungal or you're looking

1695
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,750
at the work of Albrecht where you're

1696
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:40,449
looking at these different ratios of

1697
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:46,420
minerals you want to have that balanced

1698
01:12:40,449 --> 01:12:48,729
you know I many many people could look

1699
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:50,020
at me with an absolute blank stare in

1700
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:51,429
the eye if I've ever asked them if

1701
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:54,580
they've used a Brix meter on their

1702
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:56,590
cannabis no concept of it no concept of

1703
01:12:54,579 --> 01:13:01,059
the overall compounds you know it's all

1704
01:12:56,590 --> 01:13:02,829
about the Terps dude so it it's

1705
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:04,960
understanding that you want to build

1706
01:13:02,829 --> 01:13:07,149
this diversity and you want to build

1707
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,520
this balance and these ratios so it's

1708
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,960
just it's I guess it's imperative to

1709
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,400
really understand what you're working

1710
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,050
with so the quick answer would be well

1711
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:16,269
it depends on what kind of compost but

1712
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:18,310
general parameter 10 to 30 percent of

1713
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:19,630
your soil mix right on well said and I

1714
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,310
think that you gave enough extra

1715
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:23,109
information that people can kind of you

1716
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:25,330
know think through the challenge on

1717
01:13:23,109 --> 01:13:28,389
their own based on the on the variables

1718
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:32,800
you gave them one of the ways that I use

1719
01:13:28,389 --> 01:13:34,929
compost is as a as a top dress and that

1720
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,849
kind of hits on your frequency over a

1721
01:13:34,929 --> 01:13:39,489
quantity because I'll put the compost on

1722
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:41,260
top and then every time I water it you

1723
01:13:39,488 --> 01:13:43,598
know some of the goods go down into the

1724
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:46,149
soil and I think that's a pretty common

1725
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:49,929
way to use it especially when people are

1726
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:51,249
having a not good experience with either

1727
01:13:49,929 --> 01:13:53,050
growing their cannabis or their

1728
01:13:51,248 --> 01:13:54,340
vegetables they're going in for the save

1729
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:57,159
and you know and they're adding some

1730
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:59,078
compost on the top and watering it in my

1731
01:13:57,158 --> 01:14:01,628
question for you is when using it as a

1732
01:13:59,078 --> 01:14:04,840
top dress do I need to put down the

1733
01:14:01,628 --> 01:14:08,679
compost and then put some more soil on

1734
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:11,860
top because I'm I suspect that if we use

1735
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:13,840
compost and it's going you know and it

1736
01:14:11,859 --> 01:14:16,839
is interacting with the air that it's

1737
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,639
gonna dry out and all my beneficials are

1738
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:22,149
gonna get choked out just from the

1739
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:24,219
dryness no that's a great question um

1740
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:25,809
one is typically I tell people when

1741
01:14:24,219 --> 01:14:27,458
they're applying it as a top dress you

1742
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:30,369
just want to kind of lightly scratch it

1743
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:32,559
into the surface um that also helps

1744
01:14:30,368 --> 01:14:35,469
sometimes composts have this sort of

1745
01:14:32,559 --> 01:14:38,320
initial hydrophobic aspect and you want

1746
01:14:35,469 --> 01:14:43,269
things to just absorb evenly and get

1747
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:46,658
that flow down um but that's also where

1748
01:14:43,269 --> 01:14:50,110
it's important to not have bare soil on

1749
01:14:46,658 --> 01:14:53,529
the top and utilizing just something as

1750
01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:56,488
a mulch cover at the top whether you're

1751
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:58,840
using grasses or planting cover crops is

1752
01:14:56,488 --> 01:15:01,058
planting cover crops whether you're in

1753
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:03,639
the ground or even indoors in a

1754
01:15:01,059 --> 01:15:05,349
container you can plant cover crops

1755
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:09,368
around the base of your cannabis and

1756
01:15:05,349 --> 01:15:12,038
that that adds shade it protects the

1757
01:15:09,368 --> 01:15:14,348
soil from being bare which allows all

1758
01:15:12,038 --> 01:15:16,389
these microbiology in the soil to come

1759
01:15:14,349 --> 01:15:18,788
and literally feed off the top layer

1760
01:15:16,389 --> 01:15:20,859
there and so these are one of the things

1761
01:15:18,788 --> 01:15:23,288
you see exciting and probiotic gardening

1762
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:25,598
such as working with the earth box where

1763
01:15:23,288 --> 01:15:28,748
you're growing in a small limited area

1764
01:15:25,599 --> 01:15:31,059
and your roots can't go down further

1765
01:15:28,748 --> 01:15:33,219
they just can't go into the ground ad

1766
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:34,929
infinitum and just keep going and going

1767
01:15:33,219 --> 01:15:37,328
in search of good food and if you're

1768
01:15:34,929 --> 01:15:39,729
growing outdoors you need to have a soil

1769
01:15:37,328 --> 01:15:41,529
bank approach a three to five year

1770
01:15:39,729 --> 01:15:41,920
strategic approach for building your

1771
01:15:41,529 --> 01:15:44,590
soil

1772
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,899
because if you're not you're an idiot in

1773
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:48,550
my opinion but you're just otherwise

1774
01:15:46,899 --> 01:15:50,738
you're just gonna outsource money that

1775
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:52,029
you could be building each year but if

1776
01:15:50,738 --> 01:15:53,738
you're in containers you got to realize

1777
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:55,750
things just don't drop out of the sky

1778
01:15:53,738 --> 01:15:58,509
and your root system can't go anywhere

1779
01:15:55,750 --> 01:16:02,350
else so you have an opportunity to

1780
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:04,480
create that top dress as a nutritional

1781
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:06,579
layer and that's where you're really

1782
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:08,618
you're feeding the soil not the plant

1783
01:16:06,579 --> 01:16:10,359
and you're adding the compost you're

1784
01:16:08,618 --> 01:16:12,670
protecting the top so people can come up

1785
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:16,479
and eat off the top surface that's where

1786
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:21,730
adding amendments like like a Bokashi or

1787
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:23,948
just other other forms of nutrients and

1788
01:16:21,729 --> 01:16:26,678
foods that can be applied at the top

1789
01:16:23,948 --> 01:16:28,509
surface as a top dress but then just be

1790
01:16:26,679 --> 01:16:31,779
gently covered up so then they can be

1791
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:33,850
taken not just through watering but you

1792
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:35,920
know the the microbiology in the soil

1793
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:36,489
will come to the surface and literally

1794
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,579
eat it

1795
01:16:36,488 --> 01:16:42,579
and you know and excrete it and move it

1796
01:16:39,579 --> 01:16:44,380
out I mean we see you know indoor

1797
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:45,939
warehouse is now where everything's

1798
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:48,760
grown under lights but they're growing

1799
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:49,928
in soil and these guys have cover crops

1800
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,210
growing around the base of their

1801
01:16:49,929 --> 01:16:54,399
cannabis plant and they'll pull back you

1802
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:56,408
know the the hay or straw that they're

1803
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:59,259
using as a mulch layer and you'll see

1804
01:16:56,408 --> 01:17:03,279
worms crawling around and you know a

1805
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:07,239
55-gallon pot and just creating this

1806
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:09,219
whole sort of symbiotic food web right

1807
01:17:07,238 --> 01:17:12,279
there even if they're limited to an

1808
01:17:09,219 --> 01:17:14,429
indoor environment that's that's so

1809
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:18,189
awesome and especially when you know it

1810
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:20,920
no it replaces the dead zone at the top

1811
01:17:18,189 --> 01:17:22,629
of a pot yeah and you if you just simply

1812
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:25,690
even cover it with with some sort of

1813
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:29,109
organic straw or something and it

1814
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:30,849
increases the size of the or rather the

1815
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:32,889
percentage of the amount of soil that

1816
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:35,289
your plant can actually readily use I

1817
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:37,929
would think that a pot you're gonna lose

1818
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:40,210
a certain amount of the usable soil if

1819
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:41,949
the soil at top is just facing the air

1820
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:43,630
so you might as well put in a cover crop

1821
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:46,269
not only does it look very visually

1822
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:48,460
satisfying but it's super great for the

1823
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:50,050
plant as well so we're almost out of

1824
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:52,448
time but there there are two more things

1825
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:54,719
I want to hit with you call them and one

1826
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:57,719
is its it's not mess

1827
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:59,998
growing based but you've talked about

1828
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:02,578
these these compost socks that they're

1829
01:17:59,998 --> 01:18:04,170
using at construction sites and I think

1830
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:05,670
that's an interesting idea so would you

1831
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:08,399
just hit on that briefly just because so

1832
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:10,469
people can go oh that's cool yeah I mean

1833
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:12,328
it's I was fascinated to learn several

1834
01:18:10,469 --> 01:18:14,639
years ago that the largest purchaser of

1835
01:18:12,328 --> 01:18:19,439
compost in the state of California you

1836
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:22,109
know was not almonds or not hazelnuts or

1837
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:25,379
not grapes or anything else or cannabis

1838
01:18:22,109 --> 01:18:27,299
its Caltrans and it's the State

1839
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:29,400
Department of Transportation using it

1840
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:32,630
for erosion control on highway projects

1841
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:36,328
and what they've realized is it's just

1842
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:38,880
it's that ability to create to build the

1843
01:18:36,328 --> 01:18:41,518
soil back up as a sponge to add life to

1844
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,960
the soil to help prevent water from

1845
01:18:41,519 --> 01:18:44,340
running off that's the problem with

1846
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,929
California we never have enough water

1847
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:47,729
until it rains and then we have too much

1848
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:49,949
water and it all runs out to the ocean

1849
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:51,630
we're not capturing it we're not

1850
01:18:49,948 --> 01:18:54,238
creating that filtration we're not

1851
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:56,309
building the subsoil and so the erosion

1852
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:58,828
controls fad you know just works great

1853
01:18:56,309 --> 01:19:01,170
and then they spray indigenous or native

1854
01:18:58,828 --> 01:19:03,599
wildflowers on it and boom they they

1855
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:05,099
grab the ground immediately and it takes

1856
01:19:03,599 --> 01:19:06,748
the place of a lot of these other things

1857
01:19:05,099 --> 01:19:08,909
but you'll see it on construction sites

1858
01:19:06,748 --> 01:19:11,130
anywhere where there's runoff creeks

1859
01:19:08,908 --> 01:19:13,469
streams berms and Bank mints your

1860
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:17,340
backyard might have a steep slope coming

1861
01:19:13,469 --> 01:19:19,170
from a neighbor and the compost socks

1862
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:20,940
are similar to those socks that you see

1863
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:24,449
the straw wattles in but think about

1864
01:19:20,939 --> 01:19:26,308
almost sort of a fabric pot material and

1865
01:19:24,448 --> 01:19:28,859
a large sock and the fill the entire

1866
01:19:26,309 --> 01:19:31,949
thing with compost and you lay it down

1867
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:34,889
and now it acts like a bio filtration so

1868
01:19:31,948 --> 01:19:36,328
as the water from the erosion is running

1869
01:19:34,889 --> 01:19:39,118
down the hill it's having to pass

1870
01:19:36,328 --> 01:19:41,670
through this compost berm and that

1871
01:19:39,118 --> 01:19:43,738
compost is pulling out a lot of the

1872
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:46,229
heavy metals and a lot of the pollutants

1873
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:47,848
and a lot of the harmful excess

1874
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:50,219
nutrients that are running into the

1875
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:52,619
creeks and creating these algebra and

1876
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:55,170
everything else and it's capturing that

1877
01:19:52,618 --> 01:19:57,210
in the compost and it's also flushed to

1878
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:59,399
the ground much different than those

1879
01:19:57,210 --> 01:20:01,710
concrete k-rails that you see that it

1880
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:05,819
looks like all the silt just goes right

1881
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:08,430
around you can use compost berms in

1882
01:20:05,819 --> 01:20:10,619
conjunction with specific types of

1883
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:12,950
it's for bioremediation which you see

1884
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:15,869
them using insights where

1885
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:19,019
petroleum-based runoff or other harmful

1886
01:20:15,869 --> 01:20:22,229
things that you'll see which caused you

1887
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:23,910
know just severe degradation and this is

1888
01:20:22,229 --> 01:20:26,879
something that should be looked at even

1889
01:20:23,909 --> 01:20:28,470
more in areas of heavy intense

1890
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,720
conventional farming and if you look

1891
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:32,010
what's happening to the Gulf of Mexico

1892
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,690
and everything else that's going

1893
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:36,150
downstream from that you know I went to

1894
01:20:33,689 --> 01:20:38,059
register our product in Michigan and the

1895
01:20:36,149 --> 01:20:42,149
biggest there issue there is phosphates

1896
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:44,760
and now people have been ignoring it and

1897
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:47,519
you'd had farmers for years that have

1898
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:49,110
been calculating how much fertilizer to

1899
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,850
add to their land based on how much

1900
01:20:49,109 --> 01:20:53,339
nitrogen they need to grow per acre of

1901
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:55,230
corn but they're only looking at the

1902
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:58,890
nitrogen they're not looking at the P or

1903
01:20:55,229 --> 01:21:01,409
the K or the access load and I don't

1904
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:03,300
even know what the the statistics would

1905
01:21:01,409 --> 01:21:05,309
be for a state or for this country or

1906
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:07,680
for the world but when you look at like

1907
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:09,990
just the fact that we're in a shortage

1908
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:12,180
of nutrients how many excess nutrients

1909
01:21:09,989 --> 01:21:14,849
just get flushed into our river and

1910
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:17,280
waterways and just are choking our

1911
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:19,590
aquatic life which we depend on which

1912
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,840
once again you know contributes to

1913
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:24,390
global warming you know if there is such

1914
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,520
a thing well this actually bleeds

1915
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:28,710
perfectly into the last question I had

1916
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,730
for you so like you know we've got we've

1917
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:32,250
got a you know with the last three or

1918
01:21:29,729 --> 01:21:34,649
four minutes I heard your presentation

1919
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:37,789
last weekend and enjoyed it on on the

1920
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:42,449
organic revolution and and you know you

1921
01:21:37,789 --> 01:21:45,720
in your role at Malibu compost I see you

1922
01:21:42,449 --> 01:21:47,340
both as as a researcher and product

1923
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:50,369
developer you're trying to figure out

1924
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:54,390
these these techniques for creating this

1925
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:56,069
most biodynamic compost that you can but

1926
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:57,720
then also you're also an advanced list

1927
01:21:56,069 --> 01:22:00,389
right because you're one part sales

1928
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:02,460
person you know encouraging vineyards

1929
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:05,430
and cannabis people to use your compost

1930
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:07,439
um but also you're doing things like

1931
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:09,329
like right here on my show just pretty

1932
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:11,669
much talking about compost for the

1933
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:13,890
people and for nature anyway so

1934
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:16,289
regardless of your own brand you know

1935
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:18,000
just use compost people make it buy it

1936
01:22:16,289 --> 01:22:21,569
whatever you got to do use it

1937
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,770
and so you have got a unique seat for

1938
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:28,349
this this this revival of probiotic

1939
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:31,620
growing kind of post synthetic inputs

1940
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:33,930
and so my question to you is is what are

1941
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:36,869
you seeing you know are you are you

1942
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:38,880
seeing that people are hearing the

1943
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:41,069
message and are making in the transition

1944
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:46,199
or are you seeing that it's falling on

1945
01:22:41,069 --> 01:22:48,329
deaf ears I am seeing just an absolute

1946
01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:50,488
I'm seeing a world in flux and I'm

1947
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:53,760
seeing problems become greater and

1948
01:22:50,488 --> 01:22:55,738
greater and more dire and human beings

1949
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,469
having less and less compassion and

1950
01:22:55,738 --> 01:23:00,839
communication and on the same side I'm

1951
01:22:58,469 --> 01:23:03,390
seeing community come back together that

1952
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,730
we haven't seen in years and the

1953
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:08,250
regenerative agriculture movement is so

1954
01:23:05,729 --> 01:23:10,738
exciting and inspiring because a lot of

1955
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:12,000
people just want a better way but there

1956
01:23:10,738 --> 01:23:15,839
must be a better way

1957
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,640
just please show me and what's happening

1958
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,409
in this movement and thank you for what

1959
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:21,570
you do because your help spreading the

1960
01:23:19,409 --> 01:23:23,880
word of saying these are tangible steps

1961
01:23:21,569 --> 01:23:25,619
that you can take and they work there's

1962
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:27,300
a better way and sometimes it might even

1963
01:23:25,619 --> 01:23:29,729
seem a little more expensive up front

1964
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:31,949
but you have to just look at where it is

1965
01:23:29,729 --> 01:23:34,319
six months down the road one year down

1966
01:23:31,948 --> 01:23:35,549
the road two years down the road you

1967
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:37,409
know I've talked to people who've bought

1968
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:38,820
truckloads of my compost and put it in

1969
01:23:37,409 --> 01:23:40,409
their pots and they haven't bought any

1970
01:23:38,819 --> 01:23:42,689
the next year because they've talked

1971
01:23:40,409 --> 01:23:44,420
about the residual impacts on their soil

1972
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:47,219
of what's happened after one application

1973
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:49,199
of really boosting that soil and

1974
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:51,090
creating you know if they're growing in

1975
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:53,698
ground or in trenches of what they see

1976
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:55,560
happen the secondary year and developing

1977
01:23:53,698 --> 01:23:58,319
a system so they don't have to use as

1978
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,969
much um and everywhere you look more and

1979
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:01,859
more research is coming out that's

1980
01:23:59,969 --> 01:24:04,109
showing people a better way to do it

1981
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:05,429
we're realizing and it's one of those

1982
01:24:04,109 --> 01:24:07,170
things you know the difference between

1983
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:08,730
organic and biodynamic versus

1984
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:12,739
conventional and a lot of things like

1985
01:24:08,729 --> 01:24:17,959
this it's not the differences aren't as

1986
01:24:12,738 --> 01:24:20,639
you know hyper defined until things have

1987
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:22,859
problems and then it becomes more and

1988
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:24,930
more and more clear I you know if I want

1989
01:24:22,859 --> 01:24:26,670
to do a side-by-side trial on a lawn

1990
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:30,000
with and without compost I'm gonna find

1991
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:31,649
a really crappy lawn no pun intended to

1992
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,329
put my compost on because the

1993
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:35,549
you know it's just gonna be that much

1994
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:38,130
more dramatic but we live in dramatic

1995
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:40,260
times you know we live in dramatic times

1996
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:42,179
where people have more and more cancers

1997
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,369
and more and more mental illnesses and

1998
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:46,829
Rudolf Steiner talked about this back in

1999
01:24:44,369 --> 01:24:49,920
1924 he said if people continue to eat

2000
01:24:46,829 --> 01:24:52,800
food that's devoid of life in the soil

2001
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,929
the greatest problems plaguing mankind

2002
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,610
are being to be cancers and mental

2003
01:24:54,929 --> 01:24:58,859
illnesses because you have to think

2004
01:24:56,609 --> 01:25:00,689
about our body and our brain as a highly

2005
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:03,119
developed digestive tract and we're a

2006
01:25:00,689 --> 01:25:06,750
reflection of the nutrition that we

2007
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:09,210
receive you know no matter what form it

2008
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:11,250
comes to us and so people are coming

2009
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:12,750
into this with challenges people are

2010
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:15,270
getting into growing cannabis because

2011
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:17,039
somebody got cancer you know people are

2012
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:18,390
getting into this for all sorts of

2013
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:21,539
different reasons but they're coming

2014
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:23,520
together and realizing this and with

2015
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:25,289
these new platforms of communication

2016
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,900
whether it's your podcast whether it's

2017
01:25:25,289 --> 01:25:30,210
Instagram people doing things in the

2018
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:32,339
right way in the ethical way around the

2019
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:34,408
world are now sharing information and

2020
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:36,630
saying look at what I've done look at

2021
01:25:34,408 --> 01:25:38,460
what I've done look what I did taking

2022
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:40,920
what this person has done and built off

2023
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:43,710
of it and creating this synergy of

2024
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:46,560
knowledge and of information and of

2025
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:49,890
tangible practices that we can do in our

2026
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:52,440
own gardens in our own communities you

2027
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:54,929
know and in our own countries is having

2028
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:56,908
a massive residual effect and people

2029
01:25:54,929 --> 01:25:59,460
that are doing it are seeing the results

2030
01:25:56,908 --> 01:26:02,488
their healing their cancers their

2031
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:05,760
healing their diabetes their you know

2032
01:26:02,488 --> 01:26:07,559
their their living you know they're told

2033
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,810
they got six months to live in twelve

2034
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,880
years later they're giving classes on

2035
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:13,739
nutrition and soil health you know this

2036
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:15,810
is the world that we live in so the

2037
01:26:13,738 --> 01:26:17,939
inspirations all around us you know

2038
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:21,300
again thank you for what you do because

2039
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:24,000
the the knowledge is there and it is a

2040
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:26,699
battle it's a battle a lot of this work

2041
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,219
has just been snuffed out by the power

2042
01:26:26,698 --> 01:26:31,519
of these big chemical companies by the

2043
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:33,989
power of these big agricultural

2044
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:36,449
universities land-grant universities

2045
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:38,309
because anytime there's something for

2046
01:26:36,448 --> 01:26:40,678
someone to gain somebody else has

2047
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:42,630
something to lose and when you follow

2048
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:45,179
the money and you see what other people

2049
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:45,480
have to lose and you say oh that doesn't

2050
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:47,069
sound

2051
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:49,049
possible what's not possible because

2052
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:50,939
somebody spent millions and millions and

2053
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:53,430
millions of dollars to convince farmers

2054
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:57,229
you're right it isn't possible because

2055
01:26:53,430 --> 01:27:00,780
they stand to lose everything they have

2056
01:26:57,229 --> 01:27:03,089
absolutely well hot damn call like that

2057
01:27:00,779 --> 01:27:05,519
was that's fantastic I feel very

2058
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:07,230
enthusiastic and and actually really

2059
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,650
really pleased with how this show turned

2060
01:27:07,229 --> 01:27:12,779
out this information came together on a

2061
01:27:10,649 --> 01:27:15,719
really nice package and and most

2062
01:27:12,779 --> 01:27:20,099
importantly to me not only does it give

2063
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:22,500
the compost basics but we really went

2064
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:25,530
deep into it into like third and fourth

2065
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:27,510
levels of analysis so thank you so much

2066
01:27:25,529 --> 01:27:28,679
for for not only sharing your time

2067
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:31,020
because I know your time is very

2068
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:33,840
valuable but thank you for sharing your

2069
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:36,239
experience both with the compost but

2070
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,340
with your ability to explain it in a way

2071
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:40,169
that we can all grok it without science

2072
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:42,779
degrees so thank you so much brother oh

2073
