slash gigolos our Monica Suarez Romero

30
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,340
has worked with plants since he was a

31
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:12,750
teenager he later graduated with a

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,880
degree in farm management and

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,469
agricultural engineering initially he

34
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,019
focused on research at the University of

35
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,789
Arizona with a rural with variety trials

36
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,679
in greenhouse for tomatoes and bell

37
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,210
peppers armando spent many years

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,189
consulting with large greenhouses

39
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,048
throughout the US specializing in

40
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:30,569
consulting on crop optimization and

41
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,490
high-tech irrigation our mondo is

42
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:34,589
committed to using optimal irrigation

43
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:37,228
strategies to realize optimal crop

44
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,420
production currently with Ronan armando

45
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:41,400
focuses on crop substrate and irrigation

46
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,269
systems in the controlled environment

47
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,909
agriculture out greenhouses

48
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,408
chambers today I'm on Oh we'll be taking

49
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,180
us on a quick tour of advanced

50
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,070
principles of irrigation used by the

51
00:01:49,180 --> 00:02:02,670
largest roads out there to get the most

52
00:01:51,069 --> 00:02:08,310
crop for a drop of water running so

53
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:12,430
today would basically going to go over

54
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:23,110
several techniques that have been

55
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:28,000
developed over the decades there you can

56
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:30,580
you can see me though alright so one of

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,299
these techniques are not something new

58
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,519
there's something in cameras we are

59
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:45,030
starting really to use them but they

60
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:48,489
derivate from 45 years of experience so

61
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,379
the agenda for today Teresa who is

62
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:55,060
really going through definitions and

63
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:57,689
context because we may talk about a few

64
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,129
things that are not completely obvious

65
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:03,329
for the

66
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:06,120
population particularly the second point

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:10,140
which is plant steering is like what the

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,860
[ __ ] is plant steering are you driving

69
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,859
the plant or what do you do as a matter

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,870
of fact you can drive the plant because

71
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,660
there's techniques to make them do

72
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,539
things however their plants they're not

73
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:30,090
race cars and the way stop steering

74
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:31,979
because it's a slower process and to

75
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,080
finish we're going to go over a few

76
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:38,009
concepts of irrigation scheduling and

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,450
actually how to achieve that spirit so

78
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:43,649
just as the general idea of the

79
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:46,039
presentation is that irrigation is

80
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,569
review cheapest best bang for the buck

81
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:54,359
when you're talking of steering a plant

82
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:56,879
you can see the plant by labor pretty

83
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,330
much any physical damage or pruning that

84
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,949
you do have will have a steering answer

85
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,950
except that it requires

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,330
same thing with environmental you can

87
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,430
modify the temperature you can modify

88
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,630
and immediately you can modify the

89
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,910
lighting inside a problem but those take

90
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:20,850
energy and energy and labor are

91
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,310
discussed so you want to be myself and

92
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,470
the best bang for the buck is really

93
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,160
irrigation which is generally just an

94
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:34,020
adjustment on your time clock so I

95
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:37,650
always get the hard question of how much

96
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,839
should I water please people do not

97
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,439
write this down this is the abomination

98
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,529
called

99
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:47,610
tenement equation you took the USDA

100
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:49,889
about 40 years to get this one down it's

101
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:54,830
just to illustrate how complicated that

102
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:57,870
question of how much water should I quit

103
00:04:54,829 --> 00:05:02,039
the whole moral of this story is really

104
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,629
that you really want to control the

105
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,850
temperature you really want to control

106
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,980
the lighting you really want to put for

107
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,669
the community those are the three main

108
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:15,750
factors that influence how much one and

109
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:17,959
it will depend on how hot hot right how

110
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,089
humid the

111
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:25,259
funnily enough it never depends on

112
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:28,199
whether roots are the roots of the plant

113
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:33,420
do not influence how much water you put

114
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:37,800
it over so the parameters of controlling

115
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:43,050
the root zone are really just the water

116
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:48,090
content did he see the pH and any

117
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:50,400
barrier to that water absorption the big

118
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:57,989
ones I really was happening the canopy

119
00:05:50,399 --> 00:06:00,750
environment from I'm going to talk very

120
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,490
shortly on pH maybe just because and

121
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,000
this is actually not related to the

122
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,000
discussion today but people keep asking

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,529
the question about pH in a well-drained

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:21,329
system in hydroponic systems pH does not

125
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:24,899
matter because if you put fresh solution

126
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:29,370
every time and you manage to have the

127
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:31,199
system renew all the time the pH that

128
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,860
you put a dripper is really the only

129
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,740
thing that matters the

130
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,550
yes at the bottom does not really

131
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,360
influence the rest now if you

132
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,158
recirculate

133
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,169
yes pH is important because you're

134
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:46,360
putting back that solution that you need

135
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:48,818
to control pH but on the drain to waste

136
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,960
system pH does not matter

137
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:57,250
so what you really see on pH when you

138
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:59,728
measure pH at the outlet it's really

139
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,250
what the planet is taking up so

140
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:05,348
depending on what the nutrients are

141
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,418
taking you will have a modification on

142
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:10,028
pH and that's really what people are

143
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:11,019
reading but it does not mean anything

144
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:14,649
else

145
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:17,878
so in veg generally you will get more

146
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:21,459
absorption of nitrates phosphates

147
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:24,669
sulfates and this will actually raise

148
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:28,989
the pH in flour you will get more

149
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:33,310
absorption of calcium potassium

150
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,600
and you will have a pH going down but

151
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,439
that means that the plant is actually

152
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,699
active is key so all the spirits doing

153
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:46,060
only mean one thing

154
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:48,939
feed me more which means that you need

155
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,519
to concentrate more on easy the amount

156
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:55,719
of salt that you're putting are actually

157
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:59,469
more important than the ph now let's

158
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,870
talk about water water any substrate and

159
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,210
how it moves so what you need to

160
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,120
understand of water is what we do

161
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:12,029
internal substrates is that there are

162
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:16,990
generally a mix of different sized holes

163
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:19,000
within a solid matrix so the water will

164
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,939
have a tendency to go into the largest

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,009
holes first and follow the path of least

166
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:27,098
resistance

167
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:29,470
followed by gravity so the main force

168
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:32,019
when you put water inside a container or

169
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,658
a part of pretty much any media out

170
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:37,269
there it will literally go through the

171
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:41,588
biggest holes first and try to find its

172
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:44,470
way to the bottom of the pot by again

173
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:47,080
when you put water into something that

174
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,360
something is not empty it's full of air

175
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,899
so what an error actually fighting for

176
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,778
the same space in a pot generally that

177
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,539
means that you will see bubbles at the

178
00:08:55,778 --> 00:09:00,309
bottom at the top the water trying to go

179
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:05,649
down in the air trying to go up an

180
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:10,629
escaping so but the main force at that

181
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:12,549
point is always ready when water

182
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:15,610
encounters the barrier at the bottom of

183
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:19,000
the pot tends to accumulate it's called

184
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:22,990
the interface effect water literally

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,049
pools at the bottom you will notice that

186
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:30,610
before it drains what we are actually

187
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:33,699
literally accumulate in the form of a

188
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:37,329
conical of a cone shape that's why you

189
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,040
see even it puts all the roots generally

190
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:43,179
at the bottom because I'm following the

191
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:47,528
water now let's imagine you stopped the

192
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:51,309
irrigation or right when - the water has

193
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:53,889
not yet run off out of the pot what is

194
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:56,469
it going to happen well now you get a

195
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:59,649
different force acting on that one that

196
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,379
forces the capillary forces in whatever

197
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:05,019
substrate you're using now the water is

198
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:08,500
going to move laterally and occupying

199
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:11,019
the smallest pores you see the ones that

200
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,789
the water bypass by gravity before now

201
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:18,039
the water is going to go into those

202
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:20,319
spaces so to actually manage to wet all

203
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,899
the size all the shoulders of the pot

204
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:28,930
you need to actually strategically stop

205
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:32,850
the watering at certain moments if you

206
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:36,088
don't do that water just runs off

207
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,889
and molecules of war have the weird

208
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:42,179
abilities they want to at least stay

209
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:46,979
together so once the water beats that

210
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:51,288
interface layer it will actually pull

211
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,288
the water from the container out

212
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:02,199
and by putting and by putting the water

213
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:12,250
out you will actually get the widget

214
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:14,550
right so all the irrigation scheduling

215
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:19,029
is about planning that effect between

216
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:21,069
that force drainage which by the way not

217
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:26,439
only takes water with it but also takes

218
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:29,020
talks with and strategic stopping of

219
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:35,440
irrigation to actually be able to wet

220
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:39,519
the entire problem so then we get into

221
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,680
the watering paradox where by putting

222
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,629
more water into the pot you actually

223
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:47,289
make the media the substrate drier and I

224
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:53,769
know it sounds completely

225
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:57,039
counterintuitive but yes so if you start

226
00:11:53,769 --> 00:12:00,090
draining and the pot is not yet

227
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:04,089
completely wet you will have to put

228
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,800
incredible amount of water like ten

229
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,590
times the amount of water to be able to

230
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,299
wet that part complete

231
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,550
[Music]

232
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:14,969
remember here we're talking about medias

233
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:17,609
are very very free training if you're

234
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,790
talking about peat moss or some great

235
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:24,840
love cocoa you will achieve is wedding

236
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:26,610
attack a little bit easier but they all

237
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,170
have their own set of problems that if

238
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,350
you put too much were now their water

239
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:35,279
one so basically every subtree has a

240
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,620
slightly different reaction but these

241
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:42,269
generally these are pretty much across

242
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,789
the world so if you only have to

243
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:50,669
remember one slide of the entire talk

244
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:53,819
this is probably the key ones so by

245
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:58,679
having short URL events you prevent the

246
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:02,790
drainage so you're going to accumulate

247
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:07,469
water in the part but because you have

248
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:12,299
no escape for the Sox you're going also

249
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:15,690
going to raise if you see in the box now

250
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:17,849
if you have the exact same schedule but

251
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,410
now you put longer waterings you going

252
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:25,680
to achieve the rocks so you're going to

253
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:28,529
achieve a drier pod but you're also

254
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:31,099
going to sludge the songs so you are

255
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,100
also lower

256
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:38,179
so you're going to work on it and lower

257
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:40,459
it easy now notice there's several ways

258
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:44,419
to schedule the irrigation and not only

259
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,730
how long every irrigation amenities but

260
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:49,250
also how frequently we put the

261
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:53,120
irrigation and it's actually really on

262
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:55,730
the frequency that we vary the overall

263
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,310
amount of water it's actually much

264
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:04,210
better with slow shorter irrigation

265
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:08,359
events very often than one long

266
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:11,060
irrigation event very seldomly so if you

267
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,529
put both watering that you put no worry

268
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:15,619
that is you need to put more water

269
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:18,379
overall so you're going to lower lessee

270
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,600
and ready to work on them same thing if

271
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:23,509
you shorten leave

272
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:34,570
if you cut irrigation events you put

273
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:37,429
less water rewetting I met all of you

274
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:41,990
even when you were five years old

275
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:45,409
realize that it was easier to wet a wet

276
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,840
sponge than a dry sponge same thing when

277
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:50,899
you are watering parts it's easier to

278
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,320
actually irrigate important that is not

279
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:57,840
yet completely bone dry the report that

280
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,090
I believe Andre so the rewetting ability

281
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,790
a substrate it is also very important

282
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:06,300
you never really want to go under a

283
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:09,120
certain level of water otherwise it's

284
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:15,000
very difficult to reread so ideally when

285
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:18,120
you irrigate to keep this thing as

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,360
steady as possible to be able to BRE wet

287
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,029
it because if it gets too dry it's

288
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,740
impossible

289
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:29,000
so this is the illustration on what

290
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,000
happened when you put

291
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,649
so here you have very long irrigation

292
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:41,849
that were put on hand there is what all

293
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:43,829
the roots are on the bottom well if you

294
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,830
go with very short irrigations very

295
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,840
often and you may notice that if you may

296
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,780
not have actually have the same amount

297
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,800
of water overall so you also have each

298
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:57,779
activity of your irrigation scheduling

299
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,089
influence also on how much water you're

300
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:03,000
willing to put and how much fertilizers

301
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:07,080
you're going to consume and drain down

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,850
into the waste stream so yeah this is

303
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,009
why it's about to look like we've roots

304
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,220
all over the place you don't have the

305
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:13,220
top

306
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:27,189
so now Matt's theory goes

307
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:29,470
so let's dispel a misnomer here for many

308
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:35,320
many years the cannabis industry has

309
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:40,750
been using the word legit alien to refer

310
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:43,390
to the vegetative stage to refer to the

311
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:48,370
photo period where the plant is never

312
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:51,460
induced to flower in this presentation

313
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,259
and for most spearing exceptions we are

314
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:57,250
going to use the word vegetative as

315
00:16:53,259 --> 00:17:00,069
really the production of leaf and stem

316
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:05,140
which drank that's what's most what we

317
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:08,440
do in the veg page but guess what

318
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,900
even after you sleep the plant your

319
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:14,019
first two or three weeks you're mostly

320
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:18,610
still building Canada you're still

321
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:21,009
mostly creating stems and leaves so I

322
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:24,159
would almost argue you know what the

323
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:27,869
vegetative phase really ends at your

324
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,870
second or third week of flower

325
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:35,869
but you have several plans that if you

326
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,530
keep them to comfy if you give them to

327
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:42,609
comfortable you may have remarked that

328
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:45,859
as growers they're still very least

329
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:49,129
they're still very dark green

330
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:52,879
the leaves are set the stands are fat

331
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:56,419
and they produce little teeny tiny

332
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,809
knives there is actually a plant that

333
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:02,900
even that has been induced to flower

334
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:05,928
it's still very vegetative it still

335
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,298
hormonal II induced to produce and put

336
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:11,929
all its energy into the production of

337
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:16,339
stems and use but remember here you're

338
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:18,820
trying to produce flowers so we take

339
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:21,918
squeeze them [ __ ]

340
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:24,460
you have to stress them a little bit so

341
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,610
plants generally react to stress

342
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:32,779
environmental stress like droughts like

343
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:37,298
coal in the case of the cannabis plant

344
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:40,788
it's basically a photo periodic reaction

345
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:44,480
that indicates to plant that winter is

346
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:49,069
coming so generally you're right about

347
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,798
in nature right box around the equinox

348
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:53,240
the following minutes where the day and

349
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,379
the night are pretty much the same and

350
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:02,980
that's when normal even

351
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:05,140
used to flower so all those hormonal

352
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:10,120
reactions are actually created by

353
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:14,140
environmental stresses so and now the

354
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:17,619
plant is induced to move the sugars that

355
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:21,550
it produces into the reproductive system

356
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:24,699
it's essentially a I'm dying I need to

357
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:27,039
reproduce the sweet as possible and get

358
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,880
done with this and no longer putting the

359
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:33,369
sugar in the leaves so this is called

360
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,240
generative growth also called

361
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:43,209
reproductive growth and it's essentially

362
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:46,390
the opposite now you will notice that

363
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,370
normally plants in that state type of

364
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:51,910
stress are used to produce smaller

365
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:53,529
leaves thinner stems of course people

366
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,810
are they're pretty much putting all the

367
00:19:53,529 --> 00:20:01,690
nutrients into the flower not in

368
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:04,000
distance you you may get also in cases

369
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,690
where it's very generative you may get

370
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,538
to root die offs then you can clearly

371
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:15,548
observe

372
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:18,069
around to the end of its life so now you

373
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,839
can say how do I steal that through

374
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:22,210
irrigation notice that you can steal

375
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,418
that like I mentioned previously with

376
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:28,028
pruning or with environmental controls

377
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:31,809
but again irrigation is the cheapest way

378
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:33,519
to do it so vegetative is of course when

379
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:37,808
you have a very very high water content

380
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:41,409
in your substrate the plant is not very

381
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:44,168
stress drought stress so it will produce

382
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:48,249
business death if you start stressing

383
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:56,830
the plant and simulating drought the

384
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:59,679
plant will react with generative same

385
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:02,528
thing when you decrease the irrigation

386
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,999
period so if you have a plant that has

387
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:07,358
been trained from the beginning to

388
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:09,190
accepting water from this time of the

389
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:11,539
day to this time of the day and you

390
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:15,860
start reducing the time of the day

391
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:18,289
with water they will get the cue that

392
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:22,099
they need to put that energy into the

393
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:27,220
flower irrigation frequencies every

394
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:30,649
irrigation is a cue a vegetative sleep

395
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:37,390
if you reduce the number of irrigations

396
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:40,430
you will give a generative you the easy

397
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:43,480
one you rightly see that you can cause a

398
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:49,039
soft stress instead of a water stress so

399
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:51,860
by raising the easy by lowering VC to

400
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:56,180
get a vegetative response by raising the

401
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:59,839
EC you get a general temperature of the

402
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,210
substrate also matters you get there

403
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,490
very often those crops literally

404
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,430
exploding the growth that they change of

405
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,870
season when the water temperature out of

406
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:13,580
the faucet common a different

407
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:15,949
temperature the same happens generally

408
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:20,480
at the end of the winter when suddenly

409
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:22,850
the really cold and you get crops that

410
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,680
become very day week

411
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:26,939
[Music]

412
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,910
why the prop is doing this

413
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,870
why wait suspense there well it's

414
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,870
because the part is too cold

415
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:39,900
some fertilizers also influence that's

416
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:41,730
the only it's very funny because most of

417
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,180
these things you have been doing all

418
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:51,809
along and you have been timing them

419
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:55,680
mostly on the flip the light flip but

420
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:58,799
you can actually influence and give

421
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,320
those cues even after you flip so if you

422
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,440
hop is becoming too weak after the three

423
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:07,339
you can eat up on it to give it more

424
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,140
vigor to bring it more into agitators

425
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:12,779
same thing it becomes too leasing to

426
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:16,170
vegetative even after flowering you can

427
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:21,349
actually stress in a little bit to bring

428
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:21,350
it back and tuck feeling have the powers

429
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:27,369
but how do you do that if you don't

430
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,350
measure its kind of people to manage the

431
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:32,529
type of things so you need to have a

432
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:36,579
flip-out baselines so this is a graph

433
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:41,579
that you can draw it gets with water

434
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:44,730
content meter this is the water content

435
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:50,379
the temperature of the substrate and the

436
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:50,890
EC so you see that is not the best ride

437
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,650
ever

438
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:58,000
but every one of these little spikes is

439
00:23:53,650 --> 00:24:01,120
the irrigation this is really the deal

440
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,130
of the day this would be the night where

441
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:07,750
they stop the irrigation and let it

442
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:10,750
drift back down then the next day they

443
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,690
using it again to bring the water

444
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:16,960
content up prepare the plan for the day

445
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:19,870
and actually lowering the EC here the

446
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,769
ejector is fight you see generally moves

447
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:25,750
in opposite direction and water but not

448
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,849
always like we saw previously depending

449
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:31,630
on the frequency that we use we can

450
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:34,719
actually manipulate this so now your

451
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:38,220
again you stand it's very nice to know

452
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:42,190
what's happening in the substrate but

453
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:44,430
happening you might be surprised many

454
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:48,340
grow

455
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:51,910
and when they're getting out something

456
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:54,849
as basic as putting a couple of parts or

457
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,490
a couple of blocks on top of a train and

458
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:59,169
collecting the rocks

459
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,539
measuring the volume of the runoff

460
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:05,590
measuring the volume of how much water

461
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:10,029
your pudding whether the pH meter in the

462
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:13,149
EC or for the inlet and outlet those are

463
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:16,299
basic measurements I would think every

464
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,970
grower should actually have at least an

465
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:22,769
idea of how much water they're putting

466
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,769
in and how much water the pudding Act

467
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:32,370
now seven same graph that we just saw

468
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:36,690
but the ideal one yeah yeah whatever we

469
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:38,928
have water content we have EC and you

470
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,009
have several periods during the day

471
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:49,769
where you're trying to achieve different

472
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:52,769
things am i vary by varying how long

473
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:56,849
these periods are or how aggressively go

474
00:25:52,769 --> 00:26:01,200
for up to what maximum water fountain to

475
00:25:56,849 --> 00:26:03,689
get and how proud you get the next

476
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,819
morning you can actually steal a plan

477
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,820
with a vegetatively or

478
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:17,829
so the first period is really the period

479
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:22,178
where we try to get the water you're not

480
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:24,099
draining you're putting very very short

481
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:27,280
irrigations to increase the water

482
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:32,109
content but you're also increasingly

483
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,668
easy you're not allowing any drainage at

484
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:39,719
one point during the day you are

485
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:45,630
allowing the drainage to control issue

486
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:48,700
so the control point is really easy

487
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:53,610
you're also achieving your maximum water

488
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:56,019
content for that day when you use run

489
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:57,729
and then most of the irrigation that

490
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:01,779
you're going to put after that are

491
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:05,440
really not going to achieve much except

492
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:08,470
when taking steady state then you stop

493
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,720
the irrigation and you let it drift in

494
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:14,279
the afternoon and then during the night

495
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,650
and you see that if you have very

496
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:19,629
constant but you can achieve that in

497
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,580
grow rooms will have very constant

498
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:28,350
temperature

499
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:30,609
you have a very predictable dragons

500
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:34,449
where you are going to actually know

501
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:38,589
exactly almost where you going to be the

502
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:42,539
next morning and then you have the same

503
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:47,769
strategy going over several days where

504
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:50,200
you can either go out little by little

505
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:54,369
every day and if you increase the water

506
00:27:50,200 --> 00:28:00,220
content they have today you actually get

507
00:27:54,369 --> 00:28:04,029
a vegetative response if you start going

508
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:07,079
down you achieve the opposite you get a

509
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,079
generative response

510
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:18,769
and now if you look at the overall

511
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:26,840
strategy or the life of the crop this is

512
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:30,190
starting from the flip you can go down

513
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:33,709
in the first week to make that route

514
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:38,028
then start going up back up to make them

515
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,629
produce leaves to spread them a little

516
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:43,878
bit and then keep very steady when their

517
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:49,428
flowering to fill up the flowers you

518
00:28:43,878 --> 00:28:52,248
don't want to stress them at that stage

519
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:54,619
well thank you this is this is just an

520
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:57,019
overall strategy it's not the only

521
00:28:54,618 --> 00:29:01,308
strategy possible but it's an example of

522
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:04,489
what you can you can do and how you

523
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:09,648
should actually think of strategies

524
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:12,700
works here this is just a little project

525
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:12,699
for our sponsors

526
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:20,918
little toy allows you to measure the

527
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:23,538
water content NBC India in the block

528
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,320
there's several ways to do it and we

529
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:30,288
move 300 if you have any more questions

530
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:32,418
so the orientation summaries really you

531
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:34,420
need to know your brains you need to

532
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,820
know your

533
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:41,560
again you cannot manage what you don't

534
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:45,269
measure your main tools for irrigation

535
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:47,470
are frequency and length of irrigation

536
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:51,099
though there's only tools to manipulate

537
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:54,250
the root environment the substrate that

538
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:56,709
you use is a tool for it

539
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,480
it only helps you want to choose the

540
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,829
substrate that allows you to do these

541
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,789
type of strategies in the easiest way

542
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:10,449
and again measure measure measure

543
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:13,210
because data is so important thank you

544
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:22,630
very much I hope I didn't blow out your

545
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:24,400
brains today more questions yes

546
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:33,850
absolutely we've got about eight ten

547
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:42,580
minutes so some questions well what did

548
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:44,859
I tell you I was just wonderful 58 I

549
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:48,500
wasn't you know I didn't see anything on

550
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:51,529
oh honey

551
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:58,160
in earlier slider a very early flight to

552
00:30:51,529 --> 00:31:02,980
put to rest the th question in this type

553
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:05,960
of technique the pH matters little

554
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:09,110
because if you are not afraid to waste

555
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,779
system and you renew with fresh nutrient

556
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:15,049
solution every time because you are

557
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:17,450
achieving drainage very strategic times

558
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:20,029
you're actually flushing the off sauce

559
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:25,910
so if you're always resetting the system

560
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:28,579
where the idea pH at the dripper it's

561
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:30,950
debatable what's the effect of the pH

562
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:33,589
now your decision where we were

563
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:36,140
recirculating yes the pH become very

564
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:41,929
important because now you are thinking

565
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:44,090
there again most pH are going to depend

566
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,960
on the substrate because not only the

567
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:49,480
plants influence the pH the substrate

568
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,370
you want to use a substrate that

569
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,420
basically has no influence on pH at all

570
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:59,179
and leave the pH influenced only to the

571
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,870
plan yeah then the job only using the

572
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,920
plants

573
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:05,689
and being the only actor in pH is that

574
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,110
it generally indicates you what

575
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:12,170
nutrients are taking so if you renew the

576
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:17,269
nutrients generally the pH or to correct

577
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:18,860
yourself for people using reservoirs

578
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,808
that they are recirculating there's

579
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:24,289
another trick is basically go with the

580
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:26,180
largest reservoir possible because the

581
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:27,980
larger the reservoir compared to the

582
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,650
amount of plants they're more stable

583
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:33,170
repeat

584
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,480
also another challenge with pH is that

585
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:38,360
the water quality that you're putting in

586
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:43,039
this is

587
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:43,039
play play

588
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:50,700
that's a different question than this

589
00:32:48,380 --> 00:33:02,880
this assumes that you already

590
00:32:50,700 --> 00:33:05,190
eh yes important basically it's

591
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,940
important before what you do at the

592
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,850
Draper

593
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,500
once you have any other Draper and you

594
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:14,669
put it on the three four at five five

595
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:17,250
and the drainage at eight well it's wet

596
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:20,670
it's probably that your plants are pores

597
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,200
are feeling nitrogen and they're

598
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:25,470
removing all the nitrogen from the

599
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,269
solution and it's simply saying that

600
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:31,559
they guess where you need to water

601
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:37,789
either more often or put more nutrients

602
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:37,789
in the water one more

603
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:41,608
[Music]

604
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:42,619
I guess not well then thank you very

605
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:45,720
much all right

606
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,719
