British science fiction writer Arthur C

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,638
Clarke is known for saying any

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,589
sufficiently advanced technology is

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:15,629
indistinguishable from magic

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,969
that's how I've always felt about my car

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,640
I don't particularly know much about how

8
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:22,649
my car runs other than the basics sure I

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,490
do maintenance but what really goes on

10
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,159
under the hood

11
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:27,868
might as well be magic to me after

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,059
beginning to study soil life in the

13
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:32,278
rhizosphere in depth I realized that I

14
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,839
had that same regard for water I've

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,489
always just kind of watered my plants

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,710
without really knowing what was going on

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,808
under the hood I had other stuff I had

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,558
to do so I just added water and went

19
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:45,799
about my other business in its own way -

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,939
water is indistinguishable from magic

21
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,709
during today's episode we're going to

22
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,988
talk about what water is and where it

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,329
comes from water harvesting the

24
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:56,488
responsibility that water has inside the

25
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,128
pot some thoughts on water quality and

26
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:01,140
finally some best practices for actually

27
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:04,079
watering your plants and listening to

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,368
the plant telling you her needs if you

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,200
want to learn about cannabis health

30
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:08,879
business and technique efficiently and

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,070

for cannabis conventions in 2020 which

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,130
are all now canceled I invite you to

52
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,228
consider moving your marketing

53
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,609
investment to shaping fire for only a

54
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:55,590
fraction of what it would cost you to

55
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,629
attend just one convention you can

56
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,060
advertise for nearly a year on shaping

57
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:01,828
fire it has been a busy couple weeks as

58
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,899
other companies have reached out to

59
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:05,669
shaping fire because their whole year of

60
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,379
customer outreach events was just

61
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,170
cancelled and now they are scrambling

62
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,120
for new ways to reach their customers

63
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,318
the audience for shaping fire is made up

64
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,390
of curious kin

65
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,518
enthusiasts entrepreneurs and home

66
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:20,039
growers and you can reach them for less

67
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,950
than the price of a postcard each email

68
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,620
hotspot at shaping fire calm to find out

69
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:29,459
more you are listening to shaping fire

70
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,109
and I'm your host Shango lows today my

71
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,658
guest is geologist and living soil

72
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:36,180
expert Leighton Morrison Lane has been a

73
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:38,399
lifelong enthusiast of both aquaponics

74
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,739
and living soil his obsession with

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,539
biosphere 2 led him to set up an

76
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,609
aquaculture system with the Rodale

77
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,828
Institute Leighton worked with

78
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:48,900
world-renowned soil biologist dr. Elaine

79
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:51,209
Ingham blending his aquaculture

80
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,049
byproducts with traditional compost and

81
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,150
worm castings

82
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:55,919
to prove that natural inputs could

83
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,199
effectively replace synthetics and

84
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,909
cultivation leighton currently as

85
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,250
founder of kingdom aquaponics and

86
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:04,948
invented their line of living compost

87
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,930
and compost tea products Leighton is a

88
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,329
sought-after speaker and co-founder of

89
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,010
the series of traveling science of

90
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,769
organic regenerative cannabis

91
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:16,259
cultivation conferences Leighton was

92
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:19,438
recently here for episode 54 to talk

93
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,448
about soil is geological origins and how

94
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:23,668
to mirror the layers of the earth in

95
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,819
your container garden for optimum

96
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,229
microbe life and water drainage after

97
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,179
the recording late and I talked at

98
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:32,609
length about water and this episode

99
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,349
started to form in my mind I decided

100
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,900
with the outdoor growing season coming

101
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:38,818
up fast an in-depth discussion of water

102
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,500
would be in order so we scheduled a

103
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,318
second episode together pretty quickly

104
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,959
and today we offer it to you welcome to

105
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:48,899
the show Leighton hey Shango great to be

106
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,188
back my friend great yeah really happy

107
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,620
to have you back and again so

108
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:54,448
surprisingly soon I'm sorry I missed my

109
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,128
recent trip down there because we're all

110
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,900
in quarantine but I'll look forward to

111
00:03:56,128 --> 00:04:01,258
seeing you down there and in Southern

112
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,729
California when I can so so let's get

113
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:04,888
right into it you know one of the things

114
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:06,299
that that everybody including me really

115
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:08,370
liked about the last time you're on the

116
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,620
show is that you're not afraid to talk

117
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,870
in geological terms which when you're

118
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,699
talking about soil is really informative

119
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,310
and I figured you know let's jump right

120
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,650
into the deep end of the pool this time

121
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,079
again and start with a you know start

122
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,598
with a meta question that you know we

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,019
all are so concerned and aware of the

124
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,300
quality of our water

125
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:30,818
and how much water that we are feeding

126
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,770
our plants and making sure we use clean

127
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:35,530
water for compost teas and everything

128
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:39,508
dude where did water come from

129
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,508
that's definitely jumping into the tape

130
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:45,848
all right there's two trains of thought

131
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:50,228
on that one train and that which has

132
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:53,319
been pretty much typical of science if

133
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:55,418
up until recently and that was it was

134
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,539
came from comets so it was not an

135
00:04:55,418 --> 00:05:00,158
originally here I mean we know somewhat

136
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:02,139
of how the planets are formed we talked

137
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:04,240
about that last time so you know the

138
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,250
surface of the earth was molten rock so

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,728
you know how does water stay on molten

140
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,740
rock right so basically the theory up

141
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:14,589
until recently was that it all came from

142
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,620
comets and we know for sure that there

143
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:19,899
is a tremendous asteroid belt that has

144
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:24,418
just limitless comments that are all

145
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:26,529
water that are trapped up now some other

146
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:30,899
geophysicists are starting to say that

147
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:34,989
now no no it came from a material called

148
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:38,310
carbonaceous chondrite all right and

149
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:41,050
it's it's one of the earliest known

150
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:45,490
minerals it generally considered an

151
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:50,500
asteroid but it the ironic thing is that

152
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:53,528
it has about 20% mineral content of

153
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,139
water in a solid form that's not ice it

154
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:58,028
gets it gets complicated alright so the

155
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,699
theory this this theory is that no no no

156
00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:03,699
the water was always here in the for

157
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,590
formed in the rocks it just took up the

158
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,949
heating process and then the cooling

159
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:12,209
process for that to be set free and to

160
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:15,610
rebonding to h2o as we know water today

161
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:18,038
so I mean again science will probably

162
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,710
come up with with more answers for this

163
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,449
as time progresses but I mean science is

164
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:24,008
so amazing just enough in the few years

165
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,288
that I've known you look what's happened

166
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,288
to you know like the biological kingdoms

167
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:31,899
have been broken up diatoms are now into

168
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:34,149
thrown into the algae kingdom flageolets

169
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,228
are now thrown into the algae kingdom

170
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:38,288
and they're probably all going to shift

171
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,490
again so it's an interesting time to be

172
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:42,250
alive and

173
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:45,129
because we have such incredibly powerful

174
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,250
tools that we never used to have even

175
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:51,189
five years ago so in that regard it's

176
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:54,189
it's pretty interesting I still got to

177
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:56,439
believe that that because of the volume

178
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:59,098
of water on our planet that there was

179
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:02,319
some kind of terrestrial impacts that

180
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:04,538
that were brought caused by comets that

181
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,970
brought in that that you know huge mass

182
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:09,189
amounts of ice and while I don't you

183
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,620
know I'm not a scientist of that sort

184
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:13,629
but it could also appear to me that it

185
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,908
could be both right that there that the

186
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,889
water came from comets and then also I

187
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:19,810
mean you just totally blow my blew my

188
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,210
mind that there could be deposits of

189
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,370
water that was solid that was not ice

190
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:26,379
I'm like oh god I need to go look up the

191
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,658
Wikipedia on that too even you know that

192
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,728
you know not on my show but that is

193
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:33,969
another buddies science show in and of

194
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:36,639
itself trying to understand that yeah I

195
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:39,610
mean it's it's really cool I mean it's

196
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,389
so it's so bizarre that most of the

197
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:46,300
metals in this in these you know

198
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,728
chondrites are actually in a silicate

199
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,918
oxidate and sulfides form

200
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:53,649
they're not even metal so that shows you

201
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:57,158
you know that there's some science here

202
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:58,718
that we haven't gotten to yet that will

203
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:01,509
probably answer some of these questions

204
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:03,339
in better detail as you know we learn

205
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:05,050
more and more about it but I agree my

206
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:07,899
gut feeling it was is was it was a

207
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,658
combination of both to answer the

208
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:13,120
question partly yeah cool so so let's

209
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:15,339
let's let's bring us up multiple

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,889
billions of years to the now and get a

211
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:20,619
little more grounded in in how water and

212
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:23,408
how we're using it today so what is the

213
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,509
role of freshwater in this in the soil

214
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:28,180
of our pots and fields you know I think

215
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:31,000
that a lot of us including me tend to

216
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,759
take water for granted it's like well

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,559
you put the water in and it causes some

218
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,418
life and then we got some plants and if

219
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,028
my plants droop add more water and

220
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:43,478
that's pretty much like as much as most

221
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:45,939
of us know but but but I I know from

222
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,720
talking with you that there are act as

223
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,089
there's actual jobs that water has in

224
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,230
the raizou sphere and I think we'd all

225
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:55,870
be interested in about so

226
00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:01,029
so please wait into that all right water

227
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:06,669
is the universal solvent in in terms of

228
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:08,789
pH if we have a acid or a base they do

229
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:12,279
different things they attract different

230
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,990
minerals to them and and in the periodic

231
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,029
table these elements are available in

232
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,980
different peach ph's some are available

233
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,889
only in low pH some are available in

234
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,259
high pH generally most of these elements

235
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:26,470
are available in the middle we call

236
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:29,230
neutral water so understanding that

237
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,240
water is an acid I'm gonna take you I'm

238
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,399
going to take you back to nuclear

239
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,740
science when they originally started

240
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,289
building nuclear reactors to generate

241
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,320
power the first thing that they noticed

242
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:44,289
was that they would have mineralization

243
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,480
occurring on the rods and the rods would

244
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:49,269
get thicker and thicker as the minerals

245
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,269
came out of solution and attached

246
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:55,449
themselves to these rods now if two rods

247
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:57,939
touch G's touched each other yeah that's

248
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,740
it that's called a meltdown that nothing

249
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,560
good comes from that so they quickly

250
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,019
realized that they could not use regular

251
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:07,719
spring water they needed to do a scrub a

252
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:10,809
mineral scrub of the water so then came

253
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,450
reverse osmosis and to understand in

254
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:15,879
Reverse must Moses technology it's

255
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,550
essentially like putting water in a

256
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:22,269
rubber glove and squeezing it through

257
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:24,819
the pores of the rubber how deep is that

258
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:26,740
dude yeah I think that's just like a

259
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,020
ridiculous level of filtration is the

260
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:34,029
idea right yeah you're basically

261
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:36,730
stripping it down to h2o nothing else is

262
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:39,279
coming through it and again water is the

263
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,590
universal solvent so he eats everything

264
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,669
it can either preserve it or it can eat

265
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:48,009
it so it's really a unique element in so

266
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:50,409
many ways not to mention you can't live

267
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,120
without it no life would be created if

268
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:54,309
we did not have water everything has

269
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,039
water in it every water is the

270
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:57,549
commonality of all forms of life on this

271
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,990
planet

272
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:04,240
so in that regards if you take water and

273
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,310
you squeeze it to a rubber glove and you

274
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,009
get just aged

275
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:10,109
- OH as soon as that water comes in

276
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:12,360
contact with anything it's gonna

277
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,269
automatically start pulling stuff off of

278
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,950
it because it's it's a it's a solvent

279
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:22,110
it's does its essence is to transport

280
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:24,810
nutrients minerals vitamins throughout

281
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,629
the body throughout the plant throughout

282
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:30,149
the soil system and into the microbes

283
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:36,299
everything everything has to have water

284
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:38,129
as as a base for life so it's it's it's

285
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:40,199
really interesting that the deeper you

286
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:43,289
dive down that rabbit hole

287
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,509
- just think that this one element this

288
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:52,309
one thing is the foundation of all life

289
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:55,200
so so it's role in the soil then is

290
00:11:52,309 --> 00:12:00,989
essentially to what be be a grabber and

291
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:05,370
a mover it's very existence makes sure

292
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:07,080
that I don't know nutrition and other

293
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:12,690
things in the rhizosphere

294
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:14,160
are not sedentary and move around in a

295
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,580
lot of the ways that I consider like

296
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:20,669
mycelium networks water is its own kind

297
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,710
of movement network absolutely because

298
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:24,959
it's a solvent and it's a transporter

299
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,190
and it can release these minerals and

300
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,490
vitamins

301
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,680
consider it a taxicab you know or I love

302
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,589
your you know comparison to you know the

303
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,909
mycorrhizae or saprophytic it's moving

304
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:41,490
one thing to other places and allowing

305
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:45,120
whatever is necessary to be brought to

306
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:48,450
the table um in all life forms is the

307
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,110
only I guess I'll say engine to move the

308
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:54,420
water gravity so that when we water the

309
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,740
water starts at the top of the soil and

310
00:12:54,419 --> 00:13:01,588
then it gravity is pulling it down until

311
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:04,139
I guess that it becomes so such a small

312
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:06,089
amount that it no longer there's no

313
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,870
longer a significant gravitational pull

314
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:12,510
and then it just stops or even after

315
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:15,730
water comes to rest does it still have a

316
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:20,470
tendency to move great question

317
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:25,240
so we know water has a unique ability to

318
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:27,730
be in a liquid gas or solid so you

319
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:32,169
missed one thing called evaporation hmm

320
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,579
and also wicking so in the presentation

321
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:36,189
I did it humble this year at the

322
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:38,588
conference I put up a slide showing a

323
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:42,399
bottle of water with red dye in it and

324
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:45,070
the gentleman dipped a hemp wick into

325
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,958
the one bottle that was full all the way

326
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,430
down till it got wet you know right to

327
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,409
his top of his fingers and then he

328
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:52,299
pulled the wick out and stuff that wick

329
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:54,219
into the bottle that was empty next to

330
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:58,088
it and what happened over the course of

331
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,579
48 hours was to equal out so that's

332
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:05,410
water moving against gravity it's going

333
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:08,528
up the string over and down so water has

334
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:11,139
some really unique properties that are

335
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:13,480
very different from pretty much anything

336
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:16,329
any other element on this planet because

337
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,690
again it can be liquid solid or gas so

338
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:22,179
in evaporation which is really cool the

339
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:25,029
water is getting purified it's getting

340
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:27,448
distilled so the Sun comes out

341
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:31,149
evaporates the water off the ocean and

342
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:33,729
desalinate sit and that h2o in a gaseous

343
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:36,940
form goes up into the up into the

344
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,459
atmosphere it gets cold and it starts to

345
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,560
collect together and to form clouds and

346
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,539
then those clouds get you know very very

347
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,979
dense and compacted to the point where

348
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:47,169
those molecules start to touch each

349
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,778
other and they start to form raindrops

350
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:54,370
and then they come back to earth pure

351
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:57,009
and clean until air pollution right now

352
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:59,528
acid rain and alkaline rain and all

353
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,698
these other problems with with with the

354
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:05,528
earth cleaning and cleansing the water

355
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:07,689
so with with my originally suggesting

356
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:10,809
that gravity just pulls the water down

357
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:14,860
in our pots and fields and you now

358
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:18,489
adding evaporation and wicking is it

359
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:22,899
possible that after I water and the

360
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:28,329
water finds its way down to the bottom

361
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:29,590
of the pot that the dryness of the pot

362
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:33,309
above it

363
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:35,320
wick the water back up and is it

364
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:39,609
possible that during the warmth of the

365
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,470
day the water could evaporate up into

366
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,419
the upper layers of the pot without

367
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:48,279
leaving the container well remember

368
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:51,459
that's why we got into that soil system

369
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:53,620
yeah because the a horizon is the heart

370
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,100
and lungs is the ability for water to

371
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,200
wick from lower back up so without that

372
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,670
if you were just organic matter the

373
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,830
answer is no because you don't have that

374
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:07,089
tight pore space that's required to

375
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:09,070
allow wicking to occur so come back to

376
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,930
you know the last podcast we talked

377
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:14,110
about the horizons and how critical they

378
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:16,989
are to function in in a natural system

379
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,810
because that's exactly what they do that

380
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,450
the surface dries out due to the Sun and

381
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:25,079
the wind and naturally because of the

382
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:28,509
soil system was was built through

383
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:31,750
geological time it allows that migration

384
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:34,689
not that wicking to happen and provide

385
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:37,210
pull the moisture from down deep perhaps

386
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,000
groundwater even lower to be wycked

387
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,400
up into the soil profiles to give the

388
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,120
the surface plants the moisture that

389
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,129
they need Wow all right so so now I have

390
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,649
a better understanding that that water

391
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:54,360
is not going just in one direction it's

392
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:59,110
actually moving around based on on

393
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:02,440
wicking the composition of the soil you

394
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,599
know day and night heat and so so now I

395
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,759
guess this is how it explains to me how

396
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,759
that taxi cab service really works

397
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,650
because as water is being pushed and

398
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:16,140
pulled in all these different directions

399
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:19,240
it becomes a vehicle for all these other

400
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,990
nutrients that that since water is

401
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,029
grabby and moves the water is going by

402
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,370
these nutrients that's of solvent it

403
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:29,710
grabs these nutrients and then it's

404
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:32,289
pushed and pulled all around the pot and

405
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,700
that's how it's moving around is that is

406
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,869
that a reasonable way to describe it

407
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,059
that's spot on

408
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:40,599
that's fought on I think think about um

409
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:42,789
bubble hash right water is the solvent

410
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:45,849
it's the universal ultimate

411
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:48,399
all it does everything from breaking

412
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:50,949
things down to to preventing them from

413
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,100
breaking down if you look at the pH in

414
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,720
the bogs up in Russia where we find

415
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:58,269
those mammoths that are completely

416
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,130
mummified the reason they were mummified

417
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:02,019
they were in water but the reason they

418
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,180
were mummified was because of the pH not

419
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:06,519
the water because then you look at water

420
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,890
at swamps where it's just rotting trees

421
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,779
and and and roots and everything else

422
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,660
down and turning it into organic matter

423
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:16,599
so it's really again a very very cool

424
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,820
element and it's something to you could

425
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:23,259
ponder some pretty long and hard about

426
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:25,079
you know the power of water so the last

427
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:27,220
question I want to ask you before we

428
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:30,009
before we start moving on to our first

429
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:33,370
break is that you know one of the things

430
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:38,500
that I've realized from being primarily

431
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:40,629
an outdoor grower is that when I take my

432
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:45,460
pots at the end of the season and I

433
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:47,290
throw them in the garage and you know

434
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,660
just just for storage and then when I

435
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:53,259
bring them out in the spring they're

436
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:56,830
very dry and and then when I add water

437
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:59,460
to them there's like you know the breath

438
00:18:56,829 --> 00:19:02,319
of life some sunshine and some water

439
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,480
changes the soil and and granted after

440
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,730
hearing you at the regenerative

441
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,130
conference in Michigan last year I

442
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,650
realized I should no longer be putting

443
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,780
my pots you know in the garage over the

444
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,570
winter I should just let them be outside

445
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:19,359
let them go through the full year cycle

446
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:22,029
and then when I come back in the spring

447
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,099
you know they've like totally gone feral

448
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:26,649
right there's there's there's more worms

449
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:28,299
and more life and just more everything

450
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,190
in them and I'm like oh great well I'm

451
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:32,740
just gonna put a little hole in it and

452
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,630
put my start into it and and off they go

453
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,420
on gangbusters but I think that a lot of

454
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:40,270
folks you know keep their pots like I

455
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,850
used to where we put them in the barn or

456
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:44,200
whatever and they they kind of fall

457
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,480
asleep right I always kind of think

458
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,799
about it as the soils a hibernating

459
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,289
right and so I know though that a lot of

460
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,589
the constituents of the soil wake up

461
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:58,379
when we add a little bit of

462
00:19:55,589 --> 00:20:03,470
warmth from the sunshine and and and

463
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:07,500
some water what does water due to a

464
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:11,909
dehydrated raizou sphere that brings it

465
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,669
back I'm great question alright so look

466
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:17,520
at it like this the the reason the

467
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:21,270
Paco's hydrophobic is because the

468
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:24,538
bacteria that's colonized on the surface

469
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:26,519
of the the potting mix or the organic

470
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:30,390
matter or the sand silt clay whatever it

471
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:33,028
is cysts so they find themselves in a

472
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:36,690
hostile environment they do not want to

473
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:39,000
die so they basically create a wax

474
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,700
coating around the outside of them and

475
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,919
that's why when I did some work way back

476
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,169
when it and down in University of

477
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,330
Arizona I would always be so intrigued

478
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:50,730
at how soil could float I took grab a

479
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:52,798
handful of soil throw it in a bucket of

480
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:56,009
water and it would float and the reason

481
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:59,210
was because of the biology the bacteria

482
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:01,500
had insisted and now because it's wax

483
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,298
coating on their outside of it it

484
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,179
basically can't sink it can't it can't

485
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:09,000
it can't open up and dissolve into

486
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,669
solution so the real answer is that

487
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,659
that's driven by the bacteria and and

488
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:18,149
the other biology because it has cysts

489
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:20,580
it and we know for sure that that these

490
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:22,199
cysts whether they're bacteria protozoa

491
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:25,349
can live in ice for hundreds of

492
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,769
thousands of years maybe more and we

493
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:31,109
also know that pretty much life came

494
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:34,109
from comets and so those comets were

495
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:38,219
floating around in nothingness for who

496
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:40,199
knows how long and then come into the

497
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,740
Earth's atmosphere heat up like you said

498
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,569
warm up and that ice melts and all of a

499
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,190
sudden all of those microbes come back

500
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:49,379
to life again because they've found

501
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,440
themselves in an environment that

502
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,840
supports them and allows them to grow

503
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,669
and I love the fact that you listen to

504
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,849
me and keep your pots outside because

505
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:01,230
what's happening is in those seasons you

506
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:03,389
notice there's definitely some ice

507
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,710
forming in there as the temperature gets

508
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,809
colder

509
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,600
so that's forming little water pockets

510
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:12,240
trapped in that soil mix and then as the

511
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,219
temperature warms up outside things

512
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,200
slowly come back to life so you're not

513
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,569
taking this pot that's completely dried

514
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,429
out dumping water on it and hoping that

515
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:22,558
the water starts to sink in here it's

516
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,298
gonna take you you know days to get

517
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,668
those to recharge when when you're

518
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:28,470
allowing them to do naturally in

519
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:31,288
overwintering outside especially if you

520
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,690
cover them with hay or leaves they're

521
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:34,740
gonna be just gangbusters ready to go by

522
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,528
the time you get out there with your

523
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,769
with your seedlings so yeah you're

524
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:42,538
preventing you're preventing life to be

525
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,700
so harsh that the biology has to

526
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:48,119
completely lock itself up and then take

527
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,880
days to come back to life so that that

528
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:54,898
idea that all of the life in the pot

529
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,809
when it dries out gets this waxy

530
00:22:54,898 --> 00:23:01,168
exterior is like super interesting to me

531
00:22:57,808 --> 00:23:05,220
you know I when you said that they they

532
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:08,759
they make themselves become cysts I'm

533
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:11,130
picturing all of the of the bacteria and

534
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,829
the my coryza and the you know wild

535
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,380
variety of microbes and I don't know

536
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:18,240
maybe all the living things turn

537
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,149
themselves into cysts and they make this

538
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,839
waxy exterior so that they can preserve

539
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:29,819
themselves until the you know the bad

540
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:34,189
conditions are gone so then we add water

541
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:38,220
to them and some warmth and sunshine

542
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:42,210
what is the process of them getting rid

543
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:44,159
of this waxy this this waxy outer shell

544
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:47,069
is it do they like come out of them like

545
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,309
we imagine a baby chick coming out of an

546
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:53,339
egg or is it when enough water goes past

547
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:56,609
them the water acts as a solvent and

548
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:59,129
breaks down the waxy exterior and says

549
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:01,678
you know hey all you you know living

550
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,840
forms inside these cysts I'm going to

551
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,450
remove your winter coat for you or

552
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:10,619
you're dehydrated a dehydration coat for

553
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:13,950
you and and then they're free or do they

554
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:16,109
initiate it from within the cyst that is

555
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,669
a great question my friend first of all

556
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:20,908
let's let's correct one thing

557
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:24,028
mycorrhizae don't cysts they spoil eight

558
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:25,619
or so they Creek they create spores so

559
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:28,979
it's a little different your anymore

560
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:32,069
into sexual reproduction as far as

561
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:36,479
fungal going into a suspended state of

562
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:39,778
animation whereas the bacteria and the

563
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:42,239
biology do actually sister or the

564
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:44,459
protozoa actually do sis top and and

565
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:46,019
nematode cysts as well I'm glad you made

566
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:48,479
that correction in me dude because I've

567
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:52,259
been I have been you know speaking in a

568
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:53,940
way that suggests that spores were cysts

569
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,399
and I didn't realize that they were not

570
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,078
in that family no and you know it's

571
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:00,928
really cool um and I've talked about

572
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:03,868
this before but what is occurring inside

573
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:06,989
that spore there's a whole nother

574
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:09,418
universe I mean a universe of things

575
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:11,098
that we don't know how they're how

576
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,919
they're alive they're too small for us

577
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:17,249
to study we don't understand how it's

578
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,979
like an egg that naturally hatches when

579
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:22,259
the right environment is allowed or

580
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:25,739
happens to occurs so yeah I've done some

581
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:28,019
neat work with my buddy afferent about

582
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:32,369
you know trying to understand more about

583
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:35,038
what is going on inside of a spore

584
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:38,759
versus what's going on inside of a cyst

585
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:42,179
so to answer your question insists the

586
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:45,269
the thought is that the the organism has

587
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:47,849
the components stored in what it's

588
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:49,888
called their pantry which is part of the

589
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:53,848
oregano Lowe's I don't want to go too

590
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:57,478
deep on the parts of a cell or a

591
00:25:53,848 --> 00:26:00,628
bacteria but I'm pretty much it's

592
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:02,729
storing the materials necessary to

593
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:06,118
create that coating around the outside

594
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:08,879
of it so the real mystery is is the

595
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:11,398
water what's eating the coating away or

596
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:13,199
is the water soluble izing the coating

597
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:15,118
so that the cell can pull it back in and

598
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,139
store it for the next time it needs it

599
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:20,759
or is it kind of melt away and a cell as

600
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:23,098
it starts to come alive starts

601
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,229
reproducing that and stores it in his

602
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:27,328
pantry for the next time that it needs

603
00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:29,328
to sis top so that's something that that

604
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:31,259
we science is going to need to work on

605
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:33,569
to get a better understand

606
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:36,210
is it just something that it produces is

607
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:39,210
it something that it stores or is it a

608
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:41,400
combination perhaps of both but water

609
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:44,429
definitely good water and warmth will

610
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:48,419
definitely allow that bacteria to come

611
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:50,340
out of cysts form Wow all right so I'm

612
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:52,140
sure that there are folks who are

613
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:54,539
listening who now know that they're

614
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,820
gonna leave their pots outside over

615
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,859
winter but that there's probably also

616
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:00,539
people who are in the situation that I

617
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:03,209
was in last year when I learned it from

618
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:06,599
you who had already you know put all

619
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:09,539
their their fabric pots in the barn you

620
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:14,579
know and so is there a best practice for

621
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:25,829
waking up a pot that has gone to spores

622
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:28,139
ation and cessation was there a best way

623
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:30,808
to wake it all up oh yeah absolutely

624
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,970
just bring it outside you're gonna get

625
00:27:30,808 --> 00:27:35,940
you're gonna get do you're gonna get

626
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,650
condensation you're gonna get cool at

627
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,200
night warm during the day in the

628
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,350
sunlight so that's that's a gentle a

629
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,090
gentle way to wake in it to pull it out

630
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:47,939
in spring when you have your starts

631
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:49,168
ready to go now you're shocking

632
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,630
everything you're shocking your plant

633
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:54,929
you're shocking the natural you know

634
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,640
order of systems in that soil system so

635
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:58,140
yeah I would just bring them out you

636
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,350
know a couple weeks early before you

637
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,549
want to plant them if you did store them

638
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:04,980
and just let them you know sit in the

639
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:06,569
Sun and and you know don't hesitate to

640
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,419
give a little water but know that at

641
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:11,189
night you're gonna get do and that

642
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:12,870
they're gonna gently wake up and and

643
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,789
then they'll be ready for you to plant

644
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:17,609
instead of trying to force the plant

645
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:19,109
into them as far as adding the water to

646
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:21,269
them to kind of trying to help them

647
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:24,119
jump-start so you don't have to wait for

648
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:26,460
the rain water do we want to just like

649
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:29,519
drench the hell out of them and do we

650
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,440
want to use just our regular water or is

651
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,539
this a great opportunity for us to be

652
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,390
using a compost tea instead of a

653
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:38,789
straight water well I don't know as I'd

654
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,270
I'd put the energy into making a compost

655
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:43,190
tea because basically it's gonna run off

656
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:45,589
and I wouldn't I wouldn't want to

657
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,330
overwater it because now you're now

658
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:49,339
you're washing the nutrients remember

659
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:51,019
water is the ultimate solvent so it's

660
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:53,589
gonna be starting to pull things that

661
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:57,680
you want to stay in that soil system out

662
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:59,449
so again I you know if if the mistake is

663
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,700
made and they're put into a basement or

664
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,440
garage or a barn then just put them

665
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,509
outside for a couple weeks before and

666
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,120
you're probably not gonna even have to

667
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:10,400
water them I mean I'm not telling you

668
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:11,689
not to water them but don't overwater

669
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,340
them because then you're just stripping

670
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,590
stripping things that you want to keep

671
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:19,129
right on it actually kind of reminds me

672
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:21,769
of when I had my surgery back in college

673
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,900
and they gave me a general anesthetic

674
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:25,369
and as they were bringing me out they

675
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,259
were giving me little sips of water

676
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:28,969
right they weren't giving me lots of

677
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:31,129
water they were just getting me a little

678
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,890
bit of water to you know get my system

679
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,300
you know acclimated and going so now I'm

680
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,620
thinking like oh you know same thing

681
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,559
with pots you don't want to like just

682
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:40,969
drown the pot but go ahead and give your

683
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,460
your depending on the size of the pot

684
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,980
give it a couple drinks you know over

685
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,600
the first three days to slowly prime the

686
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,589
pump

687
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:51,019
absolutely and another thing you can do

688
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:53,199
too is put all the pots in a you know in

689
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:55,279
a big square and cover them with a tarp

690
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,840
what the tarps going to do is it's going

691
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,000
to heat up from the sunlight and it's

692
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,009
gonna wick water up through the bottom

693
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,559
and condensate on the surface on the

694
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:05,119
underside of that tarp so you're you're

695
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,159
pulling you're pulling moisture up

696
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,529
through the bottom of the pot naturally

697
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,170
you're hitting it with this you know

698
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:15,410
gentle misting that's occurring on the

699
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:17,810
inside of the tarp you know and so now

700
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:21,019
you've generally just you've just you've

701
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:23,059
used nature to you know evaporate and

702
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:25,009
pump the water up into the pot from the

703
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:27,200
bottom and then drop it down and drop

704
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:28,940
micro droplets from the top so I might

705
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,410
be even better way to you know really

706
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,630
get them going if you need to quickly

707
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,980
there we go I knew I would squeeze one

708
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,460
more best practice out of you before

709
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,110
commercial dude all right so let's go

710
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,850
ahead and take our first short break and

711
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:43,159
be right back you are listening to

712
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:47,089
shaping fire and my guest today is soil

713
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,440
biologist Leighton Morrison pre-rolls

714
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:50,419
have come a long way since the early

715
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,759
days of normalization when you choose

716
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,509

Europeans that will sculpt your high in

719
00:30:56,098 --> 00:31:01,439
a way that dry old pre-rolls just can

720
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:03,148
whereas most brands release pre-rolls as

721
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,308
an afterthought for the last five years

722
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:08,069
Saints joints has focused on their line

723
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:09,808
of exotic curated joints and while some

724
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:12,479
companies just chase the hype strains

725
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:15,088
Saints joints goes deeper searching out

728
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:21,509

every step of the process so you don't

732
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,428
get runs in the paper the joint is just

called mandelbrot is one of these people

00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:02,489
Mandelbrot was also known as Roz truth

776
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:04,139
and his cultivars are known as the

777
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:06,579
foundation for the Emerald triangles

780
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,740
really hard to find quality genetics and

781
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,048
education

782
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,519
Mandelbrot was advocating for organic

783
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:17,558
growing techniques and providing

784
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,169
exceptional seeds that would sell out as

00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:21,548
soon as they hit the shelves

786
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:24,549
Mandelbrot lived too short of a life

787
00:33:21,548 --> 00:33:26,889
dying in 2015 but while he was with us

00:34:47,108 --> 00:34:51,549
that there are authentic California

824
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,619
heritage growers using natural farming

825
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,500
techniques and sunshine to cultivate

826
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:58,088
cannabis flowers for you California has

827
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,889
produced the best cannabis in the world

828
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:02,440
for generations and the idea that

829
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:04,509
massively scaled industrial cannabis

830
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,329
production can provide the same quality

831
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:10,240
a small batch lovingly cultivated

832
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:12,009
flowers is just silly moon time

833
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,379
medicinals is located in Humboldt County

834
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,420
on the lush South Fork of the eel River

835
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,119
watershed in the epicenter of the

836
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,950
American cannabis Heartland moon time

837
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,838
medicinals grow

838
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:24,598
under the bright California Sun in

839
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:27,239
greenhouses using only natural farming

840
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,338
techniques like Google culture compost

841
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:32,639
teas whole food fertilisers and

842
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:34,710
fermented plant juices every part of

843
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,629
their growing process plays its own part

844
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:39,539
in nature and nothing synthetic is

845
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:42,030
injected into the process the result is

846
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:44,699
big beautiful canvas flowers with

847
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:47,790
wide-ranging terpene profiles that taste

848
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:49,919
like great cannabis should if you live

849
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:52,800
in California ask your bud tender for

850
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,889
moon time medicinals and visit moon time

851
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,869
medicinals on the web and instagram moon

852
00:35:55,889 --> 00:36:00,690
time medicinals is also available as

853
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:02,880
part of the Redwood roots family moon

854
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,250
times whole flowers appear in Redwood

855
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,920
roots curated joint packs alongside

856
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:10,469
other heritage cannabis cultivators like

857
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,380
lady sativa Farm Ridgeline farms and

858
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:16,009
others moon time medicinals top-shelf

859
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,970
cannabis grown in harmony with nature

860
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,660
welcome back you are listening to

861
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,159
shaping fire

862
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:22,529
I'm your host Shingo Lowe's and our

863
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,989
guest today is soil biologist Leighton

864
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,180
Morrison so if you're still with us

865
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:30,059
after making it through our metaphor set

866
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:33,629
where we talked all about where water

867
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:35,639
comes from and what its job is in the

868
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,108
second set we're gonna talk about more

869
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:40,108
things that actually are gonna be useful

870
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:42,179
in your cultivation process and we're

871
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:43,619
gonna start by talking about sourcing of

872
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:45,328
water because there's a lot of different

873
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,460
places that you can get water of varying

874
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:49,710
qualities and we want to make sure that

875
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,050
you understand what your options are

876
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,059
when choosing where to get your water so

877
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,339
Leighton let's start talking about a

878
00:36:54,059 --> 00:37:02,039
little bit about water tests you know I

879
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:03,960
know that you know decoding a water test

880
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:05,250
could be an entire show in and of itself

881
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,250
and that's not what we're doing today

882
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:11,039
but for most people they know that they

883
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:13,800
should get a water test so that they

884
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,809
know what's in their aquifer or city

885
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,539
water or the rainfall near their house

886
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:19,828
or their their your runoff or whatever

887
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,730
so people generally know that they

888
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:26,220
should get one and and and I've also

889
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:29,219
kind of have the belief that most waters

890
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:31,899
are usable but I'd like you to talk a

891
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:36,459
little bit about

892
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:38,380
red flags in a water test that have got

893
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,150
to be taken care of for you to be able

894
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,260
to successfully grow a cannabis plant

895
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:45,298
and talk a little bit about pH as well

896
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:49,299
okay

897
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:53,528
again nice rabbit hole let's let's start

898
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:56,588
with the understanding of how water

899
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:58,449
moves under the ground okay so everyone

900
00:37:56,588 --> 00:38:01,358
think so I drill a well and I got well

901
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:05,078
water I got great water in the most

902
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,909
cases that's true but then you have to

903
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:11,490
start thinking about well where I

904
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:15,308
drilled my well I've basically created a

905
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:18,399
opening in the earth that allows the

906
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:22,119
surface water and groundwater to travel

907
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,599
down into the aquifer so in many ways

908
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,970
you've actually exposed that aquifer to

909
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,190
things that you weren't supposed to Wow

910
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:33,308
Sokka you could contaminate your own

911
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:36,639
aquifer during the drilling process it's

912
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:37,869
happened on Long Island and they drilled

913
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,460
these wells in the middle of the potato

914
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:41,048
fields and then they fertilize the hell

915
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,929
out of the fields and everybody got

916
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:45,759
cancer so you know that's just one case

917
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:46,838
of it and I've I've actually had been

918
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,319
fortunate enough to work with a

919
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:54,308
gentleman who does groundwater mapping

920
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:56,170
for basically Superfund sites where they

921
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:58,539
have these you know horribly toxic

922
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,970
chemicals that are in solution are

923
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:03,220
moving the water is transporting them

924
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:03,939
and they're trying to figure out how bad

925
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:07,179
it is

926
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:09,838
how deep and how heavy the concentration

927
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:13,239
is and he basically made an earth rubber

928
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,038
so he made a rubber that is can be as

929
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:17,769
long as you want it to be and he's

930
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:21,180
drilled down you know thousands of feet

931
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:23,440
and it's one contiguous rubber and

932
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:27,338
basically to what he does is he takes

933
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,470
this he drills a hole and then he based

934
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:32,858
on that hole he's already prefabricated

935
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:34,868
this this rubber that he drops into the

936
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:37,210
hole and fills up with water and as the

937
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,710
water goes in to the rubber it pushes it

938
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,720
all the way down to the bottom of the

939
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,789
hole now the cool thing is on the

940
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,329
outside of that rubber is a special

941
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:46,630
coating

942
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:49,420
that turns colors based on what chemical

943
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,640
or compound it comes in contact with so

944
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,740
by drilling a series of holes he can see

945
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,619
which way things are migrating or not

946
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:58,599
migrating and dot is critical because

947
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:01,569
you know these sites that have to be

948
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:03,610
cleaned up they need to know where where

949
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:06,190
where do you start cleaning up which way

950
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:09,010
is the water transporting these these

951
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:11,440
you know horrible chemicals so now you

952
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:13,540
start to understand that even water

953
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,809
traveling uphill this is just this - I

954
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:19,960
love this Mount Lemmon in Arizona you

955
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:23,710
can go travel through five distinct

956
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:27,940
climates or I want to call succession

957
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:29,199
airy plant systems from the base your

958
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,230
start at the bottom of the mountain

959
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:35,289
you're in a desert I mean it's hot 110

960
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:39,159
degrees very little growth or our plant

961
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:41,380
life you drive for you know a couple not

962
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,480
an hour maybe 40 minutes now you're up

963
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,579
into these you know the big cactuses the

964
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,099
big three-prong cactuses you see in the

965
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:49,509
old westerns now you're heavily and

966
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:51,699
surrounded by them and you've got

967
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:54,760
leather cactuses and more scrub and sage

968
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:57,809
and then you move up into now you've got

969
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,580
some some shrubs some deciduous plants

970
00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:01,989
and then move in a little bit further

971
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:04,690
you're getting into

972
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:06,339
not just seed you as trees and then

973
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,559
finally at the top of Mount Lemmon

974
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,329
you're in the conifers and it's snow

975
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,210
there's snow on the ground the middle of

976
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:15,639
summer

977
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:19,030
interestingly enough that as the aquifer

978
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:21,909
has gone down the has dropped in levels

979
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,950
down in the desert near Tucson and

980
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:25,599
between Tucson and Phoenix because all

981
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:28,689
the water that's been pulled out of it

982
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,659
it has changed the hydrology and now

983
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,179
there's the water is not seeping out at

984
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:36,099
the top of the mountain like it used to

985
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:37,449
um there were rivers coming down this

986
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:39,639
mountain so how the hell did the water

987
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:42,219
get from the desert where there is no

988
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:43,629
water to the top of that mountain to the

989
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:46,000
point where it created streams and

990
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:49,090
rivers coming down that's pressure

991
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,550
that's that's geology so so the weight

992
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:54,400
of the earth around it is actually

993
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,870
squeezing that water all the way up to

994
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,780
the top of that mountain and because

995
00:41:55,869 --> 00:42:00,199
that mountain has

996
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:02,600
a you know a thinner layer because of

997
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:04,939
geological tectonic plate movements the

998
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:09,139
water is allowed to squeeze out of that

999
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:12,650
so in understanding you know how water

1000
00:42:09,139 --> 00:42:16,489
moves in aquifers and in the ground it's

1001
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:18,410
critical to do your homework where is my

1002
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:21,619
water coming from another great example

1003
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:23,599
this is Cape Cod Cape Cod's a sandbar

1004
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:26,089
alright it was formed back when the

1005
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,639
glaciers were present and as they

1006
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,430
receded they pushed all this dumped all

1007
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,739
of this glacial till out into the ocean

1008
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:36,199
and created Cape Cod right well

1009
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:39,349
obviously there would be no aquifer in

1010
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:41,569
Cape Cod right not true there's a river

1011
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:43,789
coming out of the groundwater in

1012
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,519
Barnstable and that this is a big river

1013
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:47,090
I mean this is no joke one of my good

1014
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:50,210
friends

1015
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:52,910
Keith Wilder where I collect my fish

1016
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:55,970
frost from the oldest trout farm in

1017
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:58,819
America that trout farm was set up in

1018
00:42:55,969 --> 00:43:01,339
that spot because of how incredibly pure

1019
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,990
that water was and how much of it was

1020
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,000
just bubbling up out of the ground I

1021
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:06,709
mean you walk around his property and

1022
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,730
you can see water bubbling up out of the

1023
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,220
ground through the million-dollar

1024
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:15,800
question is is it fresh the water

1025
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:18,859
actually comes from Canada North New

1026
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,720
York and parts of Vermont and it

1027
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,300
actually believe it or not it's it's

1028
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:26,419
it's wonderful water the interesting

1029
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:29,450
thing is it's high in nitrate so we'd

1030
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:32,300
have to get along back to aquatic

1031
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:35,210
biology and understanding how organic

1032
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:37,400
nitrogen an organic nitrogen is not in

1033
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:40,070
the usable form but with the

1034
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,190
introduction of bacteria specifically

1035
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:45,260
nitrifying I drove actor it'll convert

1036
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,150
it to ammonia and then the ammonia

1037
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,400
converts tonight right and then the mutt

1038
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,960
the nitrite converts to nitrate now

1039
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,510
nitrate is harmless to plants and

1040
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,480
animals and we can actually use it

1041
00:43:53,510 --> 00:44:00,140
whereas nitrite can be toxic and heavy

1042
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,659
concentrations so again he's got all of

1043
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:05,139
the aquatic organisms because he's an

1044
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:08,719
aquaculture facility he grows a

1045
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:11,179
tremendous amount of biomass of

1046
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:14,299
so that there he naturally has the

1047
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:17,029
protection against the nitrites and and

1048
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,980
after his post water treated the

1049
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,230
nitrites are gone they've been

1050
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,750
completely morphed into nitrate so he's

1051
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:26,269
actually doing the water to system a

1052
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,039
favor by cleaning it with his fish

1053
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:30,829
before it's released into the streams

1054
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:33,320
and into the swamps around him so late

1055
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:36,500
so then let's let's let's bring this on

1056
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,269
back home to to the water test so I

1057
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,980
think that when you when you started

1058
00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:42,469
this this Butte this super interesting

1059
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:45,409
story I think you were starting with you

1060
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:49,250
got to know your waters from for your

1061
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:51,170
water tests and and the idea that the

1062
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:53,420
earth was pressing down on the

1063
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:56,139
groundwater enough to make it go up the

1064
00:44:53,420 --> 00:45:00,230
mountain and flow down that super-badass

1065
00:44:56,139 --> 00:45:04,670
so so what are the chemicals that if

1066
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:07,519
somebody sees in their water test coming

1067
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,950
out of their aquifer that they should

1068
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,219
raise a flag and go oh this may not be a

1069
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:14,929
good place for me to cultivate cannabis

1070
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:16,819
yeah cannabis is an accumulator so

1071
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:19,489
anything that's being transported the

1072
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:22,400
water will accumulate in your plant and

1073
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:24,979
that's a problem so backing it up most

1074
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:29,358
water tests are designed to sell you

1075
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:31,730
filters so you really need to know where

1076
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:35,019
you're sending your water test

1077
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:38,980
I recommend micro macro international

1078
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:42,440
Gretchen and her crew of scientists are

1079
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:45,139
there to actually test for minerals

1080
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:48,108
they're not they're not or you know

1081
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:51,440
pesticides residues and toxics heavy

1082
00:45:48,108 --> 00:45:53,329
metals all that most water companies or

1083
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,119
places that you send for your water

1084
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:58,699
tests short of the ones that the well

1085
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:59,720
companies work with I don't recommend

1086
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:01,009
you send it to them because they're

1087
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:03,108
gonna send some guy out there to sell

1088
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:04,609
you a filter so you know they're not

1089
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:06,380
they're not they're not finding the

1090
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:08,960
toxins those are those are too expensive

1091
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,210
to test for and most people don't test

1092
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,389
for them well water is a little

1093
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,829
different that it's because it's

1094
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:17,690
considered a potable water they're a

1095
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:20,150
little bit tighter on making sure that

1096
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:21,389
they are testing much more stringent

1097
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,680
tests

1098
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:23,909
but if you really want to know what the

1099
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,710
heck's going on you send it down to

1100
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:28,529
someone like you know macro micro

1101
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:30,389
Gretchen it and she'll tell you exactly

1102
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:31,920
what's going in your water but again you

1103
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:33,960
have to think about all right where is

1104
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,670
that water coming from if you're if

1105
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:41,250
you're south of an industrial park or

1106
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,730
potentially the water is coming through

1107
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,039
there

1108
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:47,940
you want to know and you know there are

1109
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:51,509
a lot of country or a lot of states and

1110
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:54,570
counties have done groundwater migration

1111
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:57,090
studies they're very expensive to do but

1112
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:59,309
especially around polluted areas they've

1113
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:00,840
been forced to map the groundwater so I

1114
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:04,170
would recommend that you reach out to

1115
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:06,450
your local authority and try to find out

1116
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:08,280
hey did anybody map the groundwater and

1117
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:11,429
again the groundwater is just as

1118
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,440
important as the aquifer itself and the

1119
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:15,239
groundwater because it's traveling by a

1120
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,429
pipe that someone drilled a hole and

1121
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:19,469
down to get down to the aquifer there

1122
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:21,869
were letting all of that potential

1123
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:23,969
toxins down in there now they might not

1124
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:26,699
be getting as much of it because as that

1125
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:29,789
water migrates down that shaft there is

1126
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:32,369
a current in that aquifer so it could be

1127
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:34,469
transporting those toxins away from

1128
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:35,730
their pump when they're not using it of

1129
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:37,439
course when they're pulling water

1130
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,909
they're gonna get a little bit a little

1131
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,920
bit of it up the pipe that they're

1132
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:43,109
drinking out of but for the most part

1133
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,909
anything that's coming down the sides of

1134
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,769
that shaft are gonna are gonna get

1135
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:48,449
pushed into the current so imagine you

1136
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:50,699
know you throw a tennis ball in the

1137
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:52,199
ocean well is it go is that is the ball

1138
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:53,579
getting pulled out with the tide or is

1139
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:56,099
it is it getting pushed up against the

1140
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:58,139
shore same thing is happening on the

1141
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:00,269
groundwater level as well as the aquifer

1142
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:02,819
level so you really got to know your

1143
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:06,860
business as far as you know if you're if

1144
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:12,360
you're going to rely on you know the

1145
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:15,450
well to to water your cannabis if you're

1146
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:17,519
in a industrial area like down in LA or

1147
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:20,250
San Francisco or San Diego you've got to

1148
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,980
be really careful I would almost tend to

1149
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:25,170
say you're better off to use calm water

1150
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,210
and tie up the chloramine then you are

1151
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,909
to trust the well unless you've done

1152
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:32,420
your homework and or sense it off to get

1153
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:34,759
a real hardcore water test

1154
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,380
analysis right I'm cool so so let's hold

1155
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,430
off on the chloramine discussion first

1156
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,280
sec because we're gonna get to that in a

1157
00:48:37,429 --> 00:48:42,109
little bit but um so I'm starting to

1158
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:46,670
kind of like tease out three different

1159
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:49,789
threads here as far as like how we would

1160
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,710
be using the water test so so far we've

1161
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:53,329
been kind of discussing the kind of

1162
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:57,590
research you're gonna want to do before

1163
00:48:53,329 --> 00:49:00,079
you buy a parcel to grow you know either

1164
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:01,480
either a THC cannabis or hemp on so if

1165
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,549
you're gonna be growing cannabis sativa

1166
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,960
do your homework about how the water

1167
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:10,490
moves and where the water is moving from

1168
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,710
before you buy your parcel because

1169
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:15,139
cannabis is an accumulator and you could

1170
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,940
end up growing plants that of God you

1171
00:49:15,139 --> 00:49:18,259
know arsenic or something in them and

1172
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,420
and you don't want to deal with that so

1173
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:23,180
so do your homework first before you buy

1174
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:26,030
then then there's a second thread which

1175
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:29,419
is lots of folks who are growing either

1176
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:31,640
commercial or for themselves and and

1177
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,680
they're already on their parcel and so

1178
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:36,529
you know chances are a lot of these

1179
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,480
people would already know if their water

1180
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:41,810
was contaminated and hopefully it's not

1181
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,789
and so they they already know that their

1182
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:45,019
water is good enough to grow and then

1183
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:46,909
and then there's the third category

1184
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:50,809
which are people who are on city water

1185
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:52,940
and you know unless you are you know

1186
00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:54,799
living in kind of like a failed water

1187
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:57,289
system like a Flint Michigan or

1188
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,080
something generally I would think that

1189
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:02,710
most of the city waters are you know

1190
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,809
while while maybe not epically good

1191
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:08,599
they're at least passable for pouring on

1192
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:13,329
to our cannabis plants I hope that's the

1193
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:18,559
case and so then that kind of leaves the

1194
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:20,449
Bugaboo of pH because any three of those

1195
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:24,049
categories you could be dealing with

1196
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:27,889
water that pH is poorly for growing

1197
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:29,960
cannabis so so address that specifically

1198
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:32,900
like I know that they like there's so

1199
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,480
lots of products on the market to pH up

1200
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:37,670
or pH down which are like you know I

1201
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,760
generally consider them a hassle to have

1202
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:43,099
to equalise you know all the all the

1203
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,980
water that I'm going to be offering the

1204
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:49,259
plants

1205
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:51,240
how far away from optimum is too far to

1206
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,160
be doing that all the time and you just

1207
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:57,439
need to find a different source like

1208
00:50:53,159 --> 00:51:00,809
like how far from optimum is too far

1209
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,990
would you say all right turn the scale

1210
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:11,190
pH is logarithmic so say you have a pH

1211
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:15,209
of 6 6 1 is 10 times greater than 6 6 2

1212
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:17,130
is now 10 times greater than 6 1 so it's

1213
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:19,230
logarithmic so people don't get that

1214
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,630
that there's like huge differences

1215
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:25,980
between 6 &amp; 8 I mean it's it's

1216
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:28,530
monumental 8 is considered too much it's

1217
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:35,159
too alkaline for plants to grow there

1218
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:38,760
are some some some some plants that can

1219
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:41,969
get away with it Pete for one but for

1220
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,430
the most part it's the majority of

1221
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:49,858
plants cannot tolerate about pH above 8

1222
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:52,679
or below I think it's like 4 or 5 4

1223
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:54,779
point 5 so again there are some plants

1224
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:56,909
that can tolerate that but they're few

1225
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,310
and far between so the vast majority of

1226
00:51:56,909 --> 00:52:01,108
plants we want to keep in that neutral

1227
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:03,150
zone and that's where they're gonna do

1228
00:52:01,108 --> 00:52:05,130
great now another thing to take into

1229
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:08,519
consideration is that the plant can

1230
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:10,530
adjust pH in the rouser we know this

1231
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,500
because the plant will excrete it

1232
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:17,280
exudate a certain type of bacteria will

1233
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:20,159
grow out and that bacteria is job is to

1234
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,890
mine this mineral or that mineral and it

1235
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,949
might be slightly off of the pH that the

1236
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:28,980
plant or the soil has present so by by

1237
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:31,230
adjusting the the specific bacteria that

1238
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:35,760
it wants to grow out it can adjust the

1239
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:37,579
pH to allow that mineral to be mined and

1240
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,470
brought back to the plant through

1241
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:43,650
through the nutrient cycling system the

1242
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:46,259
protozoa eating the bacteria etc so

1243
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:48,930
those are your outside parameters of pH

1244
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,790
and and that will allow a plant to grow

1245
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:52,889
but also something to take into

1246
00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:54,969
consideration is as you pour that water

1247
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:58,088
on the soil and that water moves

1248
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:59,500
the soil you're adjusting the pH I've

1249
00:52:58,088 --> 00:53:02,440
done a tremendous amount of work with

1250
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,969
people that have high pH soils or low pH

1251
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,309
soils and they need to get them adjusted

1252
00:53:03,969 --> 00:53:09,368
and the way I generally do that is with

1253
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:11,980
compost you know I can get compost it's

1254
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:13,059
more acid or more base and so I just

1255
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,800
tell them that right you know you're

1256
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:16,539
gonna have to either tail this in or

1257
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,880
you're gonna have to dig a hole and then

1258
00:53:16,539 --> 00:53:21,730
blend the existing soil with this

1259
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,430
compost and then that will equal out so

1260
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:28,179
I you it's kind of like if you take a

1261
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:30,460
soil system of six and a compost of

1262
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:32,649
eight and you mix them fifty-fifty

1263
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:35,289
equally you will end up with a pH of

1264
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:38,588
seven that that works because of these

1265
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:40,088
because these numbers are logarithmic so

1266
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:43,480
that's something to keep in mind now as

1267
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:44,880
far as as far as the the water systems

1268
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:48,130
are concerned

1269
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:51,130
generally speaking city waters are safe

1270
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:54,010
they are forced to test for heavy metals

1271
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:58,180
and pesticides the the one place that

1272
00:53:54,010 --> 00:54:01,720
they get a little bit problematic is

1273
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:03,909
that nitrogen cycle where you have the

1274
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:06,969
ammonia that they use to mix with

1275
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:08,529
chloramine our Klara chlorine and

1276
00:54:06,969 --> 00:54:11,049
ammonia mixed together and make

1277
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:13,540
chloramine so if you have a high level

1278
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:16,210
of nitrogen nitrogen I trow backer or

1279
00:54:13,539 --> 00:54:18,509
nitrogen fixing biology you're gonna

1280
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:21,730
start that process of breaking that

1281
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:24,069
organic matter say the little tiny leaf

1282
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:26,289
or you know something that got pulled

1283
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:28,179
into the pipe from the reservoir that is

1284
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:31,929
going to actually start to morph out

1285
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:34,029
start to pull off the ammonia leave the

1286
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:35,679
chlorine in place and then convert the

1287
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:38,109
ammonia to nitrite and then tonight

1288
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:41,019
trait so really depends on where you are

1289
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:43,568
in the pipeline and to how long or what

1290
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:46,509
what level of biology got into the

1291
00:54:43,568 --> 00:54:48,338
system to determine you know you know

1292
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:50,440
whether you're drinking nitrite water or

1293
00:54:48,338 --> 00:54:53,739
nitrate water so that's that's the only

1294
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:56,200
concern I have with with city water for

1295
00:54:53,739 --> 00:54:58,649
plants now human consumption will get

1296
00:54:56,199 --> 00:55:01,568
that's another hole right yeah totally

1297
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:02,500
so let's continue talking about city

1298
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:07,940
water because that's where I was gonna

1299
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:09,920
move to next anyway so you know one of

1300
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:11,869
not one of the number one question that

1301
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,940
I get from people about their city water

1302
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:17,929
is how to take out the chlorine and

1303
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,119
normally I have to explain it on them

1304
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:23,239
like oh well the chlorine is is easy you

1305
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:25,400
just take the you pour your water and

1306
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:28,549
leave it out overnight and the chlorine

1307
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:32,660
off gases and if you want to do it more

1308
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:34,910
quickly you can stir it for a bit or you

1309
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:37,190
can put a bubbler in it and chloramine

1310
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:39,079
it's it's volatile and it goes away very

1311
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:40,639
quickly but then I also have to tell

1312
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:43,279
them I'm like man they don't really use

1313
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:45,829
chlorine as much in public water works

1314
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,920
anymore and they're using chloramine

1315
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:52,369
instead and unfortunately we're not able

1316
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,220
to just mix that stuff out it's it's not

1317
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:58,250
as volatile and it stays in the water

1318
00:55:54,219 --> 00:56:00,230
but I'd like you to go ahead and repeat

1319
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:04,789
the great solution that you offered us

1320
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:08,030
last time on on how to neutralize the

1321
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:09,590
chloramine in your city water yeah no

1322
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:11,690
problem and you know I did want to back

1323
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:14,300
up on one point and you know when you're

1324
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:17,030
using town water or not time water well

1325
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:19,190
water for feeding your cannabis plants

1326
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,690
and then you test your cannabis plant

1327
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:23,179
because you're supposed to or you have

1328
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:24,920
to on a commercial scale that cannabis

1329
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,929
plants gonna tell you if your water is

1330
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,030
bad or not as long as you understand

1331
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:31,339
that you didn't put anything else into

1332
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:34,340
your system and the water was the only

1333
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:35,420
input that you use so that means you

1334
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,610
know if you're growing with mineral

1335
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,170
salts or something like that the toxins

1336
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,730
could have come in that way so you

1337
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,680
really now you have to test all these

1338
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:45,159
different things but if you're you know

1339
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:46,359
again it's this is more important in any

1340
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:48,799
suburbia

1341
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,780
urban environment than it is in a rural

1342
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,700
environment rural environment you're not

1343
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:55,550
gonna have to worry about your water as

1344
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:57,649
much but if if you did use a hemp plant

1345
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:59,539
to test your water I think it's a great

1346
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,490
idea because if you're just using water

1347
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:03,170
only that plants gonna tell you if your

1348
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:05,029
waters toxic or not because it's gonna

1349
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,849
fail a test for a metal or something

1350
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:12,910
so anyway moving on to tying up

1351
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:16,819
chloramine so chloramine is is basically

1352
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:18,829
chlorine and ammonia so if you can and

1353
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:22,220
ammonia gas is off really

1354
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:24,469
and chlorine gas is off really easy so

1355
00:57:22,219 --> 00:57:27,379
all you have to do is break it break the

1356
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:29,179
bond because chloramine is an ionic bond

1357
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,220
so it's a really really strong one

1358
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:34,879
pretty much the only thing that can do

1359
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:36,589
that from an electrolysis can but but

1360
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,539
more importantly biology and biology

1361
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:41,480
does everything which we know we've

1362
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:46,070
talked about that in the last show so if

1363
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:50,599
you introduce a humate or a humic acid

1364
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:53,090
or even even a good compost tea that's

1365
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:54,589
been concentrated um what that's gonna

1366
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:56,539
do is that's going to get in there and

1367
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:58,280
it's gonna break that molecule apart and

1368
00:57:56,539 --> 00:58:01,420
then through aeration it will gas off

1369
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:04,180
and you'll be fine so other than

1370
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:07,550
sometimes you can have what's called a

1371
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:09,859
disinfectant by-product but those will

1372
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:12,710
not hurt plants but they are harmful to

1373
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,300
animals and humans so to get to the

1374
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:19,130
nitty-gritty of it somebody who wants to

1375
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:22,250
add some humates to their water it's as

1376
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:25,730
simple as just taking some matured

1377
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:28,489
compost that you may have and putting it

1378
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:31,369
in you know an old nylon or cheesecloth

1379
00:58:28,489 --> 00:58:35,119
tying it off and and just dropping it

1380
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:37,519
into your water reservoir right I like

1381
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:40,130
to take it a little bit different path

1382
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:43,009
because you really want to get that

1383
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:44,900
humic acid out of that compost so I

1384
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:48,230
would take the compost I would saturate

1385
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:51,470
it get it really wet and then put it

1386
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:54,500
inside of say an old washcloth or a

1387
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:56,959
towel and and then dump it on the towel

1388
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,619
and then wring the towel out as hard as

1389
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,599
you can

1390
00:58:57,619 --> 00:59:02,420
now you're getting pure humic and pure

1391
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,639
folic acid concentrated whereas if you

1392
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:07,159
put the bag in in the bubbler and brew

1393
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:09,440
it you're not going to get that fast of

1394
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:13,699
a release of the things that you really

1395
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,590
need the pressure and squeezing really

1396
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:18,199
helps to get what you're looking for out

1397
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:18,860
of out of that compost as fast as

1398
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:20,929
possible

1399
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:23,360
then add that into your brewer and brew

1400
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:25,669
your water but the key again is you need

1401
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:28,460
to brew it you need to move air up

1402
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:31,010
through the water column to help break

1403
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,590
off the any of the leftover gases that

1404
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:35,080
are trapped in the water

1405
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:37,300
away from your out of your water column

1406
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:38,920
and into the atmosphere so if that's a

1407
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:42,310
little trick for you yeah that's it that

1408
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:44,619
is a good idea so I know I'm not the

1409
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:48,009
only one who's weighed this in my head

1410
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:51,009
in my early years of personal growing

1411
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:55,750
for my medical I'd be like oh my god

1412
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:58,810
trying to add compost tea to my water

1413
00:59:55,750 --> 01:00:02,829
and bubble it in my apartment is such a

1414
00:59:58,809 --> 01:00:07,570
pain in the ass and so will you give us

1415
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:10,869
the real breakdown of how necessary it

1416
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:13,870
is I mean it so many people on in

1417
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:17,199
cannabis forums they are totalitarian

1418
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:19,630
right they are you know you you must do

1419
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:22,089
everything perfectly but you know when

1420
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:25,360
it comes to us alone with nobody around

1421
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:29,110
in our garden you know very often people

1422
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:31,900
will cut corners how bad is it really to

1423
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:33,880
use your city water with chloramine to

1424
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:36,670
water your plants I mean clearly it

1425
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,170
doesn't kill them because people are

1426
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,970
growing plans with city water that's

1427
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:42,820
untreated all the time what are we

1428
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:45,939
actually losing you're losing the

1429
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,680
microbial life so that's it I mean we

1430
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:50,860
know that when these things come in

1431
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:53,230
contact with biology and not all of them

1432
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:55,690
you know this was this was the work I

1433
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:58,869
did back at Rodale and I would bring in

1434
01:00:55,690 --> 01:01:00,309
some some city water that I had and I

1435
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:02,019
was on the end of a pipe and it was I

1436
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:03,549
mean the chlorine was just so brutal

1437
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:05,650
they just burned your eyes when you

1438
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:07,780
poured a glass of water and I brought

1439
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:09,820
that down to try to do you know side by

1440
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,980
side tests at different dilutions to

1441
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:14,340
determine you know what is killing the

1442
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:17,139
biology and it does it definitely

1443
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:19,750
seriously reduces the biology not all of

1444
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:22,869
it but especially the Predators they

1445
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:25,719
take they take the big hit and fungi

1446
01:01:22,869 --> 01:01:27,359
takes a big hit the bacteria most of it

1447
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:31,389
can survive but you're gonna lose

1448
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:33,160
diversity for sure so how bad is it to

1449
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:35,109
use it it's fine if you're using salts

1450
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:36,519
if you're using a living soil system and

1451
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:39,280
you got a problem because you're gonna

1452
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:42,699
you're gonna constantly need up the the

1453
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,859
biology life in that soil because you

1454
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,239
used that chloramine

1455
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:46,889
water and it's not like you're just

1456
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:48,599
watering at once it's like you know

1457
01:01:46,889 --> 01:01:50,670
every day or every other day you're

1458
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:53,519
hitting it with more chloramine and more

1459
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:56,190
chlorinated more alarming so so Eve even

1460
01:01:53,518 --> 01:01:59,399
if you are only killing 10% of the

1461
01:01:56,190 --> 01:02:02,608
biology when you water well if you kill

1462
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:05,039
a varying 10% throughout the entire

1463
01:02:02,608 --> 01:02:07,980
summer or throughout your entire cycle

1464
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:10,319
if you're in a tent well you're you know

1465
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:12,239
you're losing a lot and your plant is

1466
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:14,670
living unsupported from the proper

1467
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,519
biology agreed you're where you're

1468
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:18,720
losing it is you're losing potency

1469
01:02:16,518 --> 01:02:21,538
cannabinoid production terpene

1470
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:23,488
production can of an all production so

1471
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:24,809
you know that's where your that's where

1472
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,190
you're losing you're still gonna you're

1473
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:27,539
still gonna get some good weed you're

1474
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:29,068
still gonna be able get high off of it

1475
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:30,930
but you're not gonna be getting what we

1476
01:02:29,068 --> 01:02:32,909
call plant potential and if you're

1477
01:02:30,929 --> 01:02:34,288
looking for plant potential you really

1478
01:02:32,909 --> 01:02:36,449
want to get that plant to give you

1479
01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:38,460
everything that it wants to give you

1480
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:40,608
then you shouldn't be using chloramine

1481
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:44,460
water you should figure out another way

1482
01:02:40,608 --> 01:02:47,130
you know you can boil it but but now

1483
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,809
you're concentrating fluoride you can

1484
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,818
use you know go down and buy bottled

1485
01:02:48,809 --> 01:02:53,730
water that's probably your easiest way

1486
01:02:50,818 --> 01:02:55,920
out of this you know I love compost tea

1487
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:57,809
but you know based on years of

1488
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,460
experience traveling the country looking

1489
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:01,798
at people's compost and having them say

1490
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:04,559
oh my god I make the best compost my

1491
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:06,449
compost is amazing and I microscope it

1492
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,789
and there's no life so again it's

1493
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:11,129
nutrient rich yeah it's it's great stuff

1494
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:13,349
I'm not knocking your compost but you

1495
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:15,390
didn't make it biologically active and

1496
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:18,239
that's the key so if you're gonna make a

1497
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:20,848
compost tea your goal is to try to get

1498
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:23,778
the biology into the soil with the tea

1499
01:03:20,849 --> 01:03:26,099
the the key is the vehicle for getting

1500
01:03:23,778 --> 01:03:29,460
living biology advanced current

1501
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:31,318
predators into your soil system and so

1502
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,318
if you're brewing with compost that has

1503
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:36,509
no biology in it what are you really

1504
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:38,940
doing well you're getting humic acid and

1505
01:03:36,509 --> 01:03:41,248
folic acid but you're not increasing the

1506
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,170
biological level in that soil so that's

1507
01:03:41,248 --> 01:03:45,118
where that's where it gets hairy when

1508
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:47,970
when you try to talk about hitting full

1509
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,338
plant potential that's where you know

1510
01:03:47,969 --> 01:03:52,949
you need a microscope or you know a

1511
01:03:50,338 --> 01:03:54,599
trusted soil food web source for getting

1512
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:55,949
your microbes tested so you know where

1513
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:57,750
you are

1514
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:59,969
your compost tested to make sure that

1515
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:01,739
you actually have biologically rich

1516
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:04,319
compost before you try to make a tea

1517
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:06,479
with it so you know all these things are

1518
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:08,220
need to be taken into consideration but

1519
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,679
if if your goal is just to grow

1520
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:12,750
something to smoke and you're happy with

1521
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:14,250
whatever the plant can produce then

1522
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:17,519
don't stress about all these things just

1523
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:22,349
you know life goes on it this plan is an

1524
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:24,509
amazing durable strong unique plant and

1525
01:04:22,349 --> 01:04:26,550
can survive and you know some of the

1526
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:28,980
most harsh conditions on the planet can

1527
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:31,079
throw at it so you know again I think

1528
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:33,059
you need to draw a line and say am I

1529
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:35,460
going for full plant potential do I want

1530
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:37,049
the best this can possibly do then I

1531
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,639
gotta get serious about it if I'm just

1532
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:39,900
trying to grow and I don't have time for

1533
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:42,179
all of that

1534
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,619
you know these intricacies then I'm just

1535
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:46,259
gonna just add the water and don't

1536
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:47,940
stress or or use town use bottled water

1537
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:50,970
because you know it's not you're gonna

1538
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:53,519
need you know 100 gallons of water if

1539
01:04:50,969 --> 01:04:57,379
you get 5 gallon jug it's probably

1540
01:04:53,519 --> 01:05:01,440
enough to water your 10 plants you know

1541
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:03,300
for at least a month right yeah and it

1542
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,659
and then you can just go and refill that

1543
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:08,060
mmm bottled water up at your local

1544
01:05:06,659 --> 01:05:10,769
grocery store

1545
01:05:08,059 --> 01:05:13,318
one of the things I like here in Seattle

1546
01:05:10,769 --> 01:05:16,679
you know I live on Vashon Island across

1547
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:19,380
the water from Seattle the the the

1548
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:23,309
Seattle Aquarium actually sells their

1549
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:25,380
reverse osmosis water out of a little

1550
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:26,880
spigot on the side of the building we

1551
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:30,059
used to use it all the time when I was

1552
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,349
into breeding fish and and so that was

1553
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,449
that was cool to be able to get very

1554
01:05:31,349 --> 01:05:34,800
cheaply the only reason I point that out

1555
01:05:33,449 --> 01:05:36,629
is you know we don't really want to

1556
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,490
encourage people to use bottled water as

1557
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:40,559
like buying a new bottle every time I

1558
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:42,269
agree my friend and I should have been

1559
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,578
more specific I was talking about those

1560
01:05:42,269 --> 01:05:46,500
ones those big jugs that you can do

1561
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:48,300
exactly that you bring them back to the

1562
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:51,358
machine you stick them in there and it

1563
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:53,130
fills it up there was yeah so um but

1564
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,199
another thing I do want to mention is

1565
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:58,650
that reverse osmosis as great as it is

1566
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:01,199
it has demineralized water so it's not

1567
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:04,500
particularly good water to grow cannabis

1568
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:06,299
or anything else to consume I mean the

1569
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,159
studies that are coming out of the

1570
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,880
Middle East right now because everything

1571
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:12,139
is D salad

1572
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,369
over there there's a huge iodine iodine

1573
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:16,379
deficiencies in the humans in the

1574
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:17,670
population and they're getting very sick

1575
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,890
because they've been drinking this stuff

1576
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:22,380
for years and there's no minerals left

1577
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:24,629
in it so I'd prefer you use spring water

1578
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,640
over RO water or if you're going to use

1579
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:30,150
RO water you've got a riad two minerals

1580
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:34,379
back into it it's like RO water is not a

1581
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:36,780
whole food no no no I mean it has its

1582
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:38,579
purpose I mean you know and people do

1583
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,240
drink it I mean look in in most

1584
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:41,009
sailboats

1585
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:43,289
they have a little ro underneath the

1586
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:45,300
sink and that's their source of water

1587
01:06:43,289 --> 01:06:48,389
and it's fine but you if you live on

1588
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:51,000
that water you are stripping minerals

1589
01:06:48,389 --> 01:06:53,969
out of your body because remember this

1590
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,039
water is the ultimate universal solvent

1591
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:58,049
so it will actually if it has no

1592
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:00,360
minerals in it and it's stripped and you

1593
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:02,880
drink it it will pull minerals out of

1594
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:04,559
your body so that's that's the other

1595
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,900
side you want your water to be

1596
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,150
mineralized that's very important for

1597
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,860
consumption and for plants too I mean

1598
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,599
it's better that you're you're giving

1599
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,789
them those those you know trace minerals

1600
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:16,860
cool so let's go on to our third a

1601
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:19,110
fourth of four sources we talked about

1602
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:21,690
city water and we talked about aquifer

1603
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:25,860
water I know that you are particularly

1604
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:27,960
honored for water harvesting as am i I

1605
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:31,230
really only ever think about rainwater

1606
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,789
myself but but then I heard you talk

1607
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:33,960
about it and you know you start ticking

1608
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:36,900
off the list of all these different

1609
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:39,829
places water can be harvested so so

1610
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:44,300
let's wade into that pun intended

1611
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:47,449
yeah where are good sources for

1612
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:50,250
capturing water wildcrafting water

1613
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:57,359
alright now we're going back into the

1614
01:07:50,250 --> 01:08:00,389
deep end again alright so most people

1615
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:02,880
would be able to identify a wet spot on

1616
01:08:00,389 --> 01:08:03,960
their land and it can be at the top of

1617
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,210
the land it could be at the bottom of

1618
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:09,329
the land it can be you know a little bog

1619
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:12,570
or an area where the soil is always

1620
01:08:09,329 --> 01:08:16,500
moist what that is is that's a artesian

1621
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:19,270
well or a ground water source that the

1622
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:21,489
waters you know losing out of the rocks

1623
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:24,010
so those are one of the areas that I

1624
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:27,338
would I love to start with this whenever

1625
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:28,420
I'm scouting a client's property which

1626
01:08:27,338 --> 01:08:31,600
is the first thing I do I'm always

1627
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:33,609
looking for the wet spots and then I can

1628
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,730
say okay we have we have a good source

1629
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:40,270
of water that we want to now direct and

1630
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:43,028
manage and harvest so that's one place I

1631
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:44,440
love rain water but you know one of the

1632
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:47,260
coolest things is seeing all these

1633
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:49,358
satellite images of what's going on in

1634
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:52,329
the atmosphere during this coronavirus

1635
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:55,000
and you know I was horrified to see how

1636
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:57,390
bad the air pollution was in the

1637
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,239
tri-state which is New York Connecticut

1638
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:03,940
and New Jersey and all of that air was

1639
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:06,699
generally moving northeast up the coast

1640
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:08,919
so you know we all have talked about

1641
01:09:06,699 --> 01:09:10,929
acid rain you know back twenty thirty

1642
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,210
years ago but no one talks about it now

1643
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:15,520
because it's not a popular topic topic

1644
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:18,069
so if I was in a situation where I

1645
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,350
wanted to collect rainwater in my old

1646
01:09:18,069 --> 01:09:22,390
state of Massachusetts or Connecticut I

1647
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:24,579
would be a little bit more concerned

1648
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:27,430
about making sure that I filtered it

1649
01:09:24,579 --> 01:09:29,380
properly and by filtering and I meant I

1650
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:32,529
mean that I would want to run it through

1651
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:34,088
other accumulator plants the hemp is a

1652
01:09:32,529 --> 01:09:36,029
great one but there's plenty of other

1653
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:40,568
ones there's all kinds of aquatic plants

1654
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:42,310
that do accumulation or clean the water

1655
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:44,230
so that so there's a little bit of a

1656
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:46,600
different spin that if you you should

1657
01:09:44,229 --> 01:09:48,939
know your atmosphere you know like the

1658
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,410
small coming out of LA blowing up into

1659
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:52,599
the valley like I would not want to

1660
01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:54,639
harvest water up there without purifying

1661
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:57,970
it or having the having the water have a

1662
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:01,060
time to to go through the root systems

1663
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:04,390
of plants that would are known to clean

1664
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:06,010
the water so those are two sources and

1665
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:07,810
then the other thing is that everyone

1666
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:09,760
collecting rainwater you know I love

1667
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:11,470
these you know cisterns outside people's

1668
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,869
houses and that all the gutters go in

1669
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:15,310
there and that's great the only problem

1670
01:10:13,869 --> 01:10:17,619
with that is you've collected the

1671
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:20,080
rainwater during the time you don't need

1672
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:23,019
it but you're gonna run out of it real

1673
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:26,769
quick when you start using it and it's

1674
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:28,900
not raining anymore so beyond that I'd

1675
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:31,360
you know set up your cistern for sure

1676
01:10:28,899 --> 01:10:32,359
you know bigger the better but where the

1677
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:34,880
water comes out

1678
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:36,859
of your cistern when it's full that's

1679
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,079
where you really want to get serious now

1680
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:40,549
you want to have a swale going through

1681
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:42,319
your property you know obviously you got

1682
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:44,210
to take topography into consideration

1683
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:46,189
and if your perfectly flat

1684
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:47,750
it doesn't matter there's still a slight

1685
01:10:46,189 --> 01:10:49,638
pitch to it you just have to get out

1686
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:51,859
there with a laser level or a hand level

1687
01:10:49,639 --> 01:10:55,069
and figure out where that pitch is and

1688
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:58,368
build a swale and better yet a bioswale

1689
01:10:55,069 --> 01:11:00,559
so you take a gentle channel and you

1690
01:10:58,368 --> 01:11:02,149
fill it with chips and then you've

1691
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,070
covered with a little bit of dirt and

1692
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:06,829
then you plant it and what those chips

1693
01:11:04,069 --> 01:11:09,769
do is they slowly suck all that water up

1694
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:14,210
and during during the rainy season and

1695
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:16,699
then as the as the rain stops coming and

1696
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:20,090
the soil starts to dry out they wick

1697
01:11:16,698 --> 01:11:23,118
that back into the soil system like we

1698
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:24,770
talked about earlier on so basically one

1699
01:11:23,118 --> 01:11:27,679
of the coolest things that I've worked

1700
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:29,600
on was where we dug a well a groundwater

1701
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,389
well to see how deep the groundwater was

1702
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,250
and I'm a big fan of this so we found

1703
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:37,279
that we found a lowest point of the

1704
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:39,770
property we dug a groundwater well lined

1705
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:41,509
it with stones I went down till till we

1706
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:44,119
hit moisture till we hit you know losing

1707
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:47,389
water then dug another couple feed and

1708
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:49,939
again lined it all with stone and then

1709
01:11:47,389 --> 01:11:52,190
watched it and we could watch the

1710
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:54,138
groundwater going up and down during

1711
01:11:52,189 --> 01:11:55,669
different seasons well after we

1712
01:11:54,139 --> 01:11:58,279
installed all of this water harvesting

1713
01:11:55,670 --> 01:12:00,170
you know these swales and smiles that's

1714
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:02,658
another one which is going to be hard to

1715
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:05,480
describe without a drawing

1716
01:12:02,658 --> 01:12:08,500
they basically raised the groundwater

1717
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:12,349
because as the groundwater went down

1718
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:14,210
naturally due to lack of rain now of a

1719
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:16,880
sudden all that water that was being

1720
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:19,239
stored in those vias whales was slowly

1721
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,100
being let back into the soil system and

1722
01:12:19,238 --> 01:12:23,569
accumulating in the well and the coolest

1723
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:25,460
part about it was it's like we could

1724
01:12:23,569 --> 01:12:27,889
pump water out of that well to do

1725
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:30,139
emergency watering and that actually

1726
01:12:27,889 --> 01:12:32,179
forced more water to come back into the

1727
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:35,300
well so it's it's you know it's a

1728
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:37,730
combination of managing your soil

1729
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:40,340
systems putting as much carbon as you

1730
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:42,408
possibly can into it to hold the

1731
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:44,409
moisture so that when it when you're

1732
01:12:42,408 --> 01:12:46,238
desperately needing the summer it

1733
01:12:44,408 --> 01:12:48,188
slowly leaching out and going back into

1734
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:49,899
either your well so you can monitor it

1735
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:52,119
or just knowing that it's naturally

1736
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:53,738
leeching out into your plants and that's

1737
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,719
where you kind of like get smart you

1738
01:12:53,738 --> 01:12:57,368
build this bio soil right through the

1739
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:59,078
middle of your field so that you know

1740
01:12:57,368 --> 01:13:01,089
that the plants on the left and the

1741
01:12:59,078 --> 01:13:02,828
right of it are getting the moisture and

1742
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:04,630
you can actually you know think of like

1743
01:13:02,828 --> 01:13:06,998
a river and you know creating all these

1744
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:08,590
different Forks coming off of it so that

1745
01:13:06,998 --> 01:13:12,760
you're you're getting these you know

1746
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:14,939
water storage units in the soil in the

1747
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:17,229
form of a carbon an old ship or

1748
01:13:14,939 --> 01:13:19,959
cardboard or paper whatever

1749
01:13:17,229 --> 01:13:22,179
and again you're planting the top of it

1750
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:24,010
so that evaporation cannot happen that's

1751
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:25,779
that's really important I don't don't

1752
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:28,239
store water in an open pond because

1753
01:13:25,779 --> 01:13:30,458
you're gonna lose it during the summer

1754
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:33,129
you're gonna store it underground under

1755
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:35,529
cover and and you'll you'll she'll see

1756
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:37,019
such a big difference in the amount of

1757
01:13:35,529 --> 01:13:39,248
watering that you actually have to do

1758
01:13:37,019 --> 01:13:40,360
that you'll realize oh my god I should

1759
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,819
have done this years ago

1760
01:13:40,359 --> 01:13:45,549
when you say stored underwater do you

1761
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:47,618
mean I mean big plastic reservoirs like

1762
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:49,779
don't worry those no I meant underground

1763
01:13:47,618 --> 01:13:52,899
oh no you don't have to you don't need a

1764
01:13:49,779 --> 01:13:55,569
lining you just basically need to dig a

1765
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:57,609
swale fill it with chips take the

1766
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:59,558
leftover dirt spread it on the top

1767
01:13:57,609 --> 01:14:01,569
couple inches and then plant it with

1768
01:13:59,559 --> 01:14:03,369
with a cover crop a ground cover and

1769
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:05,498
what that does is that prevents that

1770
01:14:03,368 --> 01:14:08,078
like if you if you just put the chips in

1771
01:14:05,498 --> 01:14:11,349
and you dump the water into those chips

1772
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:13,569
the air the wind and the Sun would

1773
01:14:11,349 --> 01:14:15,969
naturally wick that water out and

1774
01:14:13,569 --> 01:14:18,308
evaporate it so by covering it putting

1775
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:20,078
it under ground under soil and then

1776
01:14:18,309 --> 01:14:22,389
cover cropping that soil so that the

1777
01:14:20,078 --> 01:14:24,308
soil doesn't blow off in a road and also

1778
01:14:22,389 --> 01:14:25,868
again and then the soil could wick the

1779
01:14:24,309 --> 01:14:27,788
moisture out of the chips and up out

1780
01:14:25,868 --> 01:14:30,339
into the surface if you don't have

1781
01:14:27,788 --> 01:14:32,649
ground cover to protect it the soil so

1782
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:35,889
is the only is the way that you access

1783
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:40,288
that water for your plants by planting

1784
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:43,059
your cannabis plants there because so so

1785
01:14:40,288 --> 01:14:44,438
no no basically what you're doing is

1786
01:14:43,059 --> 01:14:47,260
you're thinking along the lines of

1787
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:48,789
wicking so basically you're storing the

1788
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:52,300
water there but that water is being

1789
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:55,748
waked out laterally horizontally upwards

1790
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:57,320
even up gradient as necessary so you're

1791
01:14:55,748 --> 01:14:59,359
basically you're

1792
01:14:57,319 --> 01:15:01,399
concentrating the water in one spot

1793
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:05,119
knowing that it's going to wick out and

1794
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:06,920
spread out in an of greater area than

1795
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:09,170
where the water is concentrated at that

1796
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,880
point in time that a little bit depends

1797
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:13,730
on your soil system you know in a clay

1798
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,079
soil it's not gonna wick as fast in a

1799
01:15:13,729 --> 01:15:17,149
sandy soil obviously it's gonna work a

1800
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:19,309
lot quicker so there are some other

1801
01:15:17,149 --> 01:15:21,319
considerations to think about but what

1802
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:23,600
it's doing is its raising the moisture

1803
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:25,309
level in the soil it's not it's not

1804
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,960
watering the plants it's not like it's

1805
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:29,420
you know you're you're using it to

1806
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,720
surface water you're just allowing the

1807
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:34,220
roots to have greater access to

1808
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,570
subsurface water and moisture I

1809
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:37,930
understand now

1810
01:15:35,569 --> 01:15:41,269
so whereas a pond you can actually

1811
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:43,730
siphon the water out of the pond with

1812
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:46,310
the hose and pointed at your pots or

1813
01:15:43,729 --> 01:15:48,709
your drip line and there you go you're

1814
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:52,580
talking about we want to capture and

1815
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:55,699
keep as much of the water on our parcel

1816
01:15:52,579 --> 01:15:56,479
mm-hmm exactly using the soil to do the

1817
01:15:55,699 --> 01:15:59,750
work for you

1818
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:02,929
you know in I love I love the guys that

1819
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:05,180
have those water tanks uphill and they

1820
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:07,159
use you know obviously gravity to to

1821
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:10,369
water your plants well it's the same

1822
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:12,649
idea except for it's the soil now so the

1823
01:16:10,369 --> 01:16:14,329
soil is actually because you dug the

1824
01:16:12,649 --> 01:16:16,099
Swale you put all those chips in there

1825
01:16:14,329 --> 01:16:17,750
and when your sister and overflowed it

1826
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:20,030
overflowed into that Swale and that

1827
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:22,760
swells slowly the water moved down by

1828
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:24,859
gravity to the end of it and those all

1829
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,510
those chips got what we call field

1830
01:16:24,859 --> 01:16:29,210
capacity they got as wet as they

1831
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:31,310
possibly can and now they've held all of

1832
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:33,829
that moisture there for you so that as

1833
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:35,300
as the ground dries out around it

1834
01:16:33,829 --> 01:16:37,819
because there's no longer rain coming

1835
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:41,079
down the ground around it is now pulling

1836
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:43,250
that water out of that Iowa's whale and

1837
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:46,789
supporting a moisture level that it

1838
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:48,590
needs for the plants to grow right on I

1839
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:50,930
understand that and I actually saw that

1840
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:52,279
a great example of that gosh was the

1841
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:54,710
beginning of last summer or the summer

1842
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:56,809
before but anyway at a ladies sativa

1843
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:59,899
farm in Humboldt they they live at the

1844
01:16:56,810 --> 01:17:01,640
top of a mountain and you know most of

1845
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:03,170
us go through a drought season and

1846
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,470
they're like listen during the rainy

1847
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:08,690
season we have to capture as much of

1848
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:11,240
this water here at the top of the

1849
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:15,229
mountain because it's really

1850
01:17:11,239 --> 01:17:18,289
to go down the hill and so they they you

1851
01:17:15,229 --> 01:17:21,409
know they use swales and ponds and you

1852
01:17:18,289 --> 01:17:23,720
know a whole variety of techniques that

1853
01:17:21,409 --> 01:17:27,829
we actually go through with the with the

1854
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:29,060
interview with Rio from ladies sativa

1855
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:32,600
that's on the YouTube channel that you

1856
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:35,840
can check out and and you know his goal

1857
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:38,060
like yeah he's a he's a cannabis farmer

1858
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,569
but he's all like man he says I spend

1859
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:44,660
more of my time sequestering water and

1860
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:47,869
growing cover crops and and and making

1861
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:49,819
the water work to leave my property

1862
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:52,309
as much as he's growing cannabis which I

1863
01:17:49,819 --> 01:17:55,279
found really interesting let's um let's

1864
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:56,990
let's talk about this the other category

1865
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:58,670
of folks because certainly in the

1866
01:17:56,989 --> 01:17:59,719
regenerative agriculture scene which we

1867
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:02,000
love so much there's a lot of these

1868
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:04,640
permaculture techniques that have made

1869
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,210
their way into the scenes so people

1870
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:09,650
aren't just directly pumping the aquifer

1871
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:12,319
but let's answer this question in

1872
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:15,409
another way for folks who are you know

1873
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:17,539
just growing their you know there's six

1874
01:18:15,409 --> 01:18:20,930
personal plants that are available in a

1875
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:22,550
lot of states up to like the 15 that are

1876
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:25,490
available in a lot of states for medical

1877
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:28,520
if you don't have property if you're not

1878
01:18:25,489 --> 01:18:31,460
trying to sequester all of this water on

1879
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:33,710
your acreage and you just don't want to

1880
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:35,750
use your city water

1881
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:38,180
I recognize that we have to be a little

1882
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:39,859
bit aware of where our rainwater is

1883
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,000
coming from and what it's made up and

1884
01:18:39,859 --> 01:18:43,549
you know especially if we live in an

1885
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,840
industrial city what would you consider

1886
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:51,710
a simple and effective way to capture

1887
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:54,140
rainwater cleanly you know just to be

1888
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:58,699
just to be working on your 6 or 15

1889
01:18:54,140 --> 01:19:00,619
plants that's a good one I mean again

1890
01:18:58,699 --> 01:19:03,139
one of the things that I said earlier

1891
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:05,059
about capturing rainwater I mean if I

1892
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:07,430
was in one of those industrial zones or

1893
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:09,860
in a city I would want to be running

1894
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:12,500
that water through you know some mosses

1895
01:19:09,859 --> 01:19:15,019
or some other plants that actually do

1896
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,239
clean the water so now I'm making it too

1897
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:19,010
complicated for these guys because now

1898
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:21,319
I'm saying okay yeah captured capture

1899
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:23,869
the water off the gutters but then take

1900
01:19:21,319 --> 01:19:27,449
it and you've got to store it somewhere

1901
01:19:23,869 --> 01:19:30,000
most people literally are taking it off

1902
01:19:27,449 --> 01:19:32,130
the roof or they've got a big tarp and

1903
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,649
they're funneling it into a rain barrel

1904
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:36,779
and they've got a rain barrel with a

1905
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:38,519
spout and then they fill up their

1906
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:39,960
watering can with that and they go put

1907
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,330
it on their plants I mean I would say

1908
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,199
that's the default setting for most

1909
01:19:42,329 --> 01:19:46,439
people

1910
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:49,289
small cropping and and capturing

1911
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:52,739
rainwater what do you think of that

1912
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:55,289
setup is that like you to what degree do

1913
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:58,099
you need to add this step where you you

1914
01:19:55,289 --> 01:20:00,359
put it through some grasses or something

1915
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:03,030
again it's now we're hitting you know

1916
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:07,649
we're dividing the hair between full

1917
01:20:03,029 --> 01:20:09,329
plant potential and just plant so so it

1918
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:11,429
you know if you want to go to the next

1919
01:20:09,329 --> 01:20:12,779
level then that's what I would do is I

1920
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:14,760
would look at you know these different

1921
01:20:12,779 --> 01:20:16,649
plants another thing you can do is could

1922
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,510
be old canary in the coalmine throw a

1923
01:20:16,649 --> 01:20:20,309
couple goldfish in there and if these

1924
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,989
goldfish die you know you've got a

1925
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:24,810
problem but if they're thriving and

1926
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:27,809
living then you're okay so you know that

1927
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:30,000
might be a quick easy way for people to

1928
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:33,000
know that the water that they're using

1929
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,130
or collecting harvesting is safe because

1930
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,899
you know the canary in the coalmine is

1931
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,760
50 goldfish dies you got a problem

1932
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:40,979
another thing that the goldfish would do

1933
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:43,680
too is if you feed it it's gonna make

1934
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:46,139
some poop for you which is aquaponics so

1935
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,909
a couple birds with one stone there yeah

1936
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:50,100
there you go so hey let's go ahead and

1937
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:52,019
take our second commercial break you are

1938
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:54,060
listening to shaping fire and my guest

1939
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:57,840
today is soil biologist and all-around

1940
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:59,760
good guy late Morrison one of the

1941
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,770
reasons why no-till cannabis growing is

1942
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,690
so valued by farmers is because the

1943
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:06,240
mycelium networks in the soil remain

1944
01:21:03,689 --> 01:21:08,250
established from year to year and we

1945
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,750
know these fungal networks are essential

1946
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:11,850
because they are the nutrients

1947
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:13,680
superhighways that extend far and wide

1948
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:16,470
in the substrate to feed your plants

1949
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:18,630
the trouble with growing in new soils or

1950
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:20,699
blended cocoa substrates is that it

1951
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:23,579
takes most of the plant's life just to

1952
01:21:20,699 --> 01:21:26,069
create these mycelium highways Dino

1953
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:28,649
Michael endo mycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1954
01:21:26,069 --> 01:21:31,229
reduces that time and gets your plant

1955
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:33,899
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

1956
01:21:31,229 --> 01:21:35,759
and it's three times the concentration

1957
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:39,059
of the current leading brand in the US

1958

1959
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:43,560

1960
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:46,050

1963

01:26:49,569 --> 01:26:52,539
listening to shaping fire

2086
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:54,730
I'm your host Shengo Louis and our guest

2087
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:56,829
today is soil biologist slate Morrison

2088
01:26:54,729 --> 01:26:58,959
so here in the last set we are going to

2089
01:26:56,829 --> 01:27:01,569
be talking about best practices for

2090
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,730
watering because you know for something

2091
01:27:01,569 --> 01:27:07,210
that seems so simple there are a lot of

2092
01:27:03,729 --> 01:27:10,809
ways to screw it up so Layton what

2093
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:12,970
factors determine how much to water I

2094
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:15,670
know for a lot of folks we kind of just

2095
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:17,619
think well you know let's just drench

2096
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:19,989
the hell out of it and then that way I

2097
01:27:17,619 --> 01:27:22,149
know that it won't dry out before the

2098
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:25,599
next time I come back to my pot but

2099
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:27,909
that's not very strategic so so leaning

2100
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,500
on the biological knowledge what's the

2101
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:32,470
actual way for us to figure out how much

2102
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:35,560
the water listen to the plant it'll tell

2103
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:38,039
you if the Sun leaves are tracking the

2104
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:40,480
Sun or the lights in your tent and

2105
01:27:38,039 --> 01:27:43,180
praying to it you know the moisture is

2106
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:44,769
perfect so when they're drooping that

2107
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:47,350
usually means that they're either

2108
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:50,050
lacking moisture or they have too much

2109
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:52,480
moisture and over-watering definitely

2110
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:54,699
moves soil particles down into the

2111
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:57,819
profile as well as washes out nutrients

2112
01:27:54,699 --> 01:28:00,010
so I'm a big fan of those blue mats you

2113
01:27:57,819 --> 01:28:01,779
know you can regulate it moisture meters

2114
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:03,039
are helpful but eventually you'll get

2115
01:28:01,779 --> 01:28:04,569
used to it you'll just be able to stick

2116
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:05,890
your finger in there and if you can feel

2117
01:28:04,569 --> 01:28:07,569
it you'll know you're in a good place

2118
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:10,119
and if your plants praying to the Sun

2119
01:28:07,569 --> 01:28:10,909
you know you're know you're in the sweet

2120
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:12,470
spot

2121
01:28:10,909 --> 01:28:14,479
yeah man there's nothing quite like when

2122
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:16,520
the when the plants are praying and

2123
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:18,349
they're all you know up there reaching

2124
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:19,790
and they're tracking the Sun or the

2125
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:22,789
light and they've got that slight

2126
01:28:19,789 --> 01:28:24,409
inverted taco look oh my gosh when I see

2127
01:28:22,789 --> 01:28:26,269
that I'm just like give myself a little

2128
01:28:24,409 --> 01:28:31,220
pat on the back and I'm all like thank

2129
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:32,330
God I'm doing it right today tells you

2130
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:34,310
everything you need to know you're just

2131
01:28:32,329 --> 01:28:35,720
gonna learn how to listen to it so what

2132
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:39,020
are the some of the factors that are

2133
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:41,150
going to play a role in how much we're

2134
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:43,340
gonna water I'm assuming heat and

2135
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:45,769
humidity are gonna play a big role how

2136
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:48,650
should we think about that humidity is a

2137
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:50,120
huge role because if it's too dry if

2138
01:28:48,649 --> 01:28:53,149
it's the winter and you've got your heat

2139
01:28:50,119 --> 01:28:55,039
on and your HVAC system is pushing heat

2140
01:28:53,149 --> 01:28:56,809
all over the place yeah it's gonna dry

2141
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:58,430
out and that's where I recommend if

2142
01:28:56,810 --> 01:29:00,500
you're in a tent you get one of those

2143
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:03,350
little tiny humidifiers they're

2144
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:05,300
inexpensive and it will help to put

2145
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:08,000
moisture into the air and you won't have

2146
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:11,800
to water nearly as much so that's a

2147
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,149
great way of preventing the soil from

2148
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:16,100
wicking the moisture out in and letting

2149
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:18,049
the air pull it out because you guys all

2150
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:20,150
have fans too you have to move the air

2151
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:22,070
around so when that wind is blowing

2152
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:24,259
across the pot it is pulling moisture

2153
01:29:22,069 --> 01:29:25,789
out of it so that humidifier is a great

2154
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:28,970
trick and then of course cover cropping

2155
01:29:25,789 --> 01:29:31,640
on a big fan of no soil left bare so

2156
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:33,199
that those leaves are covering up every

2157
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:34,910
square inch of that pot and what you'll

2158
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:36,409
notice when you flip the leaves over and

2159
01:29:34,909 --> 01:29:38,659
look at the underside there'll be a

2160
01:29:36,409 --> 01:29:40,309
little condensation so it's preventing

2161
01:29:38,659 --> 01:29:42,619
that moisture from escaping from the

2162
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:44,900
surface of that pot great way to prevent

2163
01:29:42,619 --> 01:29:47,119
excess water excellent I think it's good

2164
01:29:44,899 --> 01:29:51,859
for us to point out momentarily you know

2165
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:54,680
cover crops do not steal nutrients from

2166
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:57,439
your pot no they do not and they build

2167
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:59,119
miles of Rio sphere which crosses the

2168
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:01,250
roots of your other cannabis plants

2169
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:03,229
there's all kinds of wonderful exchanges

2170
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:05,029
that are happening there as well as

2171
01:30:03,229 --> 01:30:08,539
nutrient cycling you're getting extra

2172
01:30:05,029 --> 01:30:09,920
extra protozoa extra bacteria that are

2173
01:30:08,539 --> 01:30:12,109
all functioning for you at a high level

2174
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,789
so they're not stealing nutrients

2175
01:30:12,109 --> 01:30:17,359
they're actually adding them back to you

2176
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:21,970
fantastic so you know a lot of us are

2177
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:24,649
slowly but surely converting over to

2178
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:26,780
fabric plots and

2179
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:29,839
you know there's a lot of reasons why

2180
01:30:26,779 --> 01:30:31,460
black plastic pots are questionable

2181
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,039
everything from the fact that they're

2182
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:35,720
plastic to the fact that you know they

2183
01:30:34,039 --> 01:30:37,550
tend to get a little sludgy at the

2184
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:39,260
bottom if people don't you know have

2185
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:41,239
rocks in the bottom there's a lot of

2186
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:43,310
good reasons to go to the fabric pots

2187
01:30:41,239 --> 01:30:46,880
and then you know and then you've got

2188
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:49,850
like you know companies like like grass

2189
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:53,930
roots that are actually lining the

2190
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:56,720
inside of the fabric pots so they lose

2191
01:30:53,930 --> 01:31:00,100
less air out to sides but in your

2192
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:03,860
experience Layton do we need to water

2193
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:06,920
fabric pots more often oh yeah they

2194
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:08,479
definitely leach out moisture out the

2195
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,949
sides of them it's the same thing it's

2196
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:11,509
like if you're in a plastic pot the only

2197
01:31:09,949 --> 01:31:13,699
thing where you have to be concerned

2198
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:15,260
about is the top of the pot with a

2199
01:31:13,699 --> 01:31:16,970
fabric pot you got the sides as well

2200
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:18,770
that's where I always say you know you

2201
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:20,990
need some kind of vapor barrier to

2202
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:22,550
prevent that moisture exchange glad to

2203
01:31:20,989 --> 01:31:24,469
hear that the pot companies are actually

2204
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:26,900
taking that into consideration now

2205
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:28,490
because in the past when you see these

2206
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,989
the sides of the pots would go

2207
01:31:28,489 --> 01:31:31,519
hydrophobic so you pour the water on the

2208
01:31:29,989 --> 01:31:32,869
topic room right over the sides and

2209
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,850
right down the sides and you couldn't

2210
01:31:32,869 --> 01:31:36,380
get the moisture in there and you see

2211
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:37,970
you talked about that last time about

2212
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:40,400
how you saw a huge difference with the

2213
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:43,190
cover crops now you can't cover crop the

2214
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:45,859
side of your pot but you can do things

2215
01:31:43,189 --> 01:31:48,679
like put hay bales against them foam if

2216
01:31:45,859 --> 01:31:51,439
you have extra foam so that you prevent

2217
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:53,060
that water or the air from stealing the

2218
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,789
moisture out of the side of the pot and

2219
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:57,650
and also temperature we don't want the

2220
01:31:55,789 --> 01:32:00,140
sides of that pot to get to get warm

2221
01:31:57,649 --> 01:32:02,869
because that's going to directly affect

2222
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:04,940
the biology so by insulating it and

2223
01:32:02,869 --> 01:32:06,769
putting a vapor barrier in on the sides

2224
01:32:04,939 --> 01:32:08,149
of your pot you're gonna be able to use

2225
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:09,740
those and I'm a big fan of those fabric

2226
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:11,689
pots I really like yeah I'm actually

2227
01:32:09,739 --> 01:32:14,269
really excited they're calling these

2228
01:32:11,689 --> 01:32:17,239
living soil fabric pots from grassroots

2229
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:20,420
pots they actually sent me out a couple

2230
01:32:17,239 --> 01:32:23,109
to trial and and so I'm actually

2231
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:26,000
trialing the their pots but then also

2232
01:32:23,109 --> 01:32:27,439
they're fabric beds they've got liners

2233
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,699
on those too because they're like hey

2234
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:32,239
you know we all know that we're losing

2235
01:32:28,699 --> 01:32:35,359
water out the sides and fabric pots are

2236
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:38,929
not necessarily as effective as

2237
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:41,059
pushing the so the the water down to the

2238
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:43,100
the bottom of the pot because so often

2239
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:47,990
it just evaporates out the sides

2240
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:48,920
no so anyway there's a lot of people who

2241
01:32:47,989 --> 01:32:49,729
have used them because these are you

2242
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,170
know they've had they've abused have

2243
01:32:49,729 --> 01:32:53,569
been out for a year or two already

2244
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:55,369
I'm just getting around to it so so I'll

2245
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:59,689
tell you more of my thoughts and they'll

2246
01:32:55,369 --> 01:33:05,119
fall on that so so okay so let's next

2247
01:32:59,689 --> 01:33:08,059
talk about hydrophobic pots so um I can

2248
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:10,579
copy this right I'm I have been the

2249
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:14,360
worst I did not even realize what was

2250
01:33:10,579 --> 01:33:16,689
going on in my pots until I heard you

2251
01:33:14,359 --> 01:33:19,939
speak at the Michigan region event

2252
01:33:16,689 --> 01:33:21,079
because this and and I just know that so

2253
01:33:19,939 --> 01:33:23,750
many people are gonna like oh [ __ ] that

2254
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:26,680
happens to me too I would hand water my

2255
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:30,409
pot and I would watch the water bead

2256
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:33,170
slide across the surface of the pot and

2257
01:33:30,409 --> 01:33:33,920
then go down the sides and I'm all like

2258
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:37,220
dammit

2259
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:40,190
oh man I want the water to go into the

2260
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:41,990
soil and yet it was going away you know

2261
01:33:40,189 --> 01:33:45,289
he was just sliding off as if it would

2262
01:33:41,989 --> 01:33:48,559
like the soil was a solid structure and

2263
01:33:45,289 --> 01:33:50,630
it was after listening to you and dr.

2264
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:55,130
Elaine Ingham that I realized that I

2265
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:58,550
needed to add a cover crop to create all

2266
01:33:55,130 --> 01:34:00,529
of these opportunities for the for the

2267
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:02,570
water to go inside and now I don't have

2268
01:34:00,529 --> 01:34:03,619
that problem but I know there's people

2269
01:34:02,569 --> 01:34:07,880
who are listening who have that problem

2270
01:34:03,619 --> 01:34:10,939
so so go ahead and hit on what makes a

2271
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:12,710
pot go hydrophobic and and and I'm

2272
01:34:10,939 --> 01:34:19,219
assuming you're going to but talk crap

2273
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:21,739
about peat moss to you know how much and

2274
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:23,869
I've been blessed to have worked with a

2275
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:26,829
company called pittmoss back ten years

2276
01:34:23,869 --> 01:34:29,300
ago or so in trying to develop a product

2277
01:34:26,829 --> 01:34:30,739
Mott Hadley you know was grinding up

2278
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:33,590
newspapers because he saw his

2279
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:36,289
grandmother use newspapers to line her

2280
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:37,940
soil in her outdoor gardens and he

2281
01:34:36,289 --> 01:34:40,310
realized wool way they have a great

2282
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:42,589
moisture holding capacity if I shredded

2283
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:44,060
it maybe maybe I could get away from you

2284
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:46,850
know using peat and he started this

2285
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:49,100
company and through the years you know

2286
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:52,310
he's gone ups and downs and finally just

2287
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:54,410
recently a group has come in and really

2288
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:56,390
started to grab this thing by the horns

2289
01:34:54,409 --> 01:34:58,909
and they're developing some wonderful

2290
01:34:56,390 --> 01:35:00,380
products I'm on beta testing a bunch of

2291
01:34:58,909 --> 01:35:02,930
them now I'm actually working with them

2292
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:04,489
on formulating one specifically for

2293
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:06,289
living soil systems which I'm really

2294
01:35:04,489 --> 01:35:08,539
excited about it's gonna be mushroom

2295
01:35:06,289 --> 01:35:10,069
compost it's gonna be core believe it or

2296
01:35:08,539 --> 01:35:13,960
not they've got a great source of clean

2297
01:35:10,069 --> 01:35:17,689
core ground-up paper pulp cardboard pulp

2298
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:19,880
which is an amazing fungal food the

2299
01:35:17,689 --> 01:35:21,500
biology that I've seen in in so far and

2300
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:23,210
the products that they've sent me I

2301
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:25,340
either see a tremendous amount of spores

2302
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:26,930
or I see a tremendous amount of hyphy

2303
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:29,000
could you imagine being able to buy a

2304
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:31,460
soil that was loaded with hyphy out of

2305
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,550
the gate what a jumpstart

2306
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:36,739
hey what's funny too is pittmoss has

2307
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:38,449
reached out to me as well to send me

2308
01:35:36,739 --> 01:35:40,309
stuff because they heard through the

2309
01:35:38,449 --> 01:35:42,769
grapevine that I talk a lot of crap

2310
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:43,850
about you know taking peat moss out of

2311
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:45,920
the environment because it's not

2312
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:47,600
sustainable and now hear that they've

2313
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,270
reached out to you somebody over there

2314
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:52,550
is doing a good job actually not to

2315
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:56,900
folks like us yeah I give actually a lot

2316
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:59,390
of credit she she heard me on a podcast

2317
01:35:56,899 --> 01:36:02,359
and and hit me up because I was bashing

2318
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:04,910
peat and so it's it's wonderful I'm

2319
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:06,799
ecstatic to be you know back in touch

2320
01:36:04,909 --> 01:36:10,099
with them and and back in doing some

2321
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,840
trials to see how they're performing and

2322
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:14,960
how we could formulate better ones but I

2323
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:17,989
didn't answer your question so so

2324
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:20,329
hydrophobic is is basically that you

2325
01:36:17,989 --> 01:36:22,969
have organic matter which is what the

2326
01:36:20,329 --> 01:36:24,739
plants growing in and the outside of

2327
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:27,890
that organic matter is completely coated

2328
01:36:24,739 --> 01:36:30,949
with bacteria and those bacteria go back

2329
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:33,020
into that system as they dry out and

2330
01:36:30,949 --> 01:36:35,449
they create that wax surface which

2331
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:37,520
doesn't allow the water in so in a

2332
01:36:35,449 --> 01:36:40,970
situation where I have a hydrophobic pot

2333
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:43,580
I don't have cholera crop I would take a

2334
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:46,190
wet towel I get a towel soaking wet and

2335
01:36:43,579 --> 01:36:48,050
then I cover it and so that that water

2336
01:36:46,189 --> 01:36:50,479
slowly wycked out of the towel and

2337
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:52,369
worked back into the pot and so that

2338
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:55,879
would be the way to quickly as quick as

2339
01:36:52,369 --> 01:36:57,430
possible take the hydrophobic component

2340
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,859
out of the

2341
01:36:57,430 --> 01:37:01,869
the surface of that soil now the

2342
01:36:59,859 --> 01:37:04,029
interesting thing is with pittmoss it

2343
01:37:01,869 --> 01:37:06,699
has a similar side effect that I've

2344
01:37:04,029 --> 01:37:08,529
noticed in my starts that it does it

2345
01:37:06,699 --> 01:37:10,449
does go a little bit hydrophobic on the

2346
01:37:08,529 --> 01:37:11,979
surface but as soon as you break through

2347
01:37:10,449 --> 01:37:14,139
it you could feel that it's nice and

2348
01:37:11,979 --> 01:37:15,669
moist inside so that's one of the things

2349
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:18,579
that we're talking about it's like all

2350
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:20,619
right how do we prevent the soil from

2351
01:37:18,579 --> 01:37:22,079
going hydrophobic on the surface and you

2352
01:37:20,619 --> 01:37:25,269
know explain to them the reasons why

2353
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:27,430
we're playing with a organic based

2354
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:29,890
wetting agent that's going to prevent it

2355
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:32,140
from happening but you know again would

2356
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:33,220
we need some more time to really get

2357
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:35,110
these kinks out of it

2358
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:37,510
product development aside though we have

2359
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:39,880
the answer right it's it's you've got to

2360
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:41,400
have a cover crop you know and like

2361
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:44,619
whether it's you know whether it's

2362
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:47,170
grasses or clovers or radishes or you

2363
01:37:44,619 --> 01:37:49,300
know the build a soil like cover crop

2364
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:52,119
mix or you know there's a lot of really

2365
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:53,970
great options but the point is you got

2366
01:37:52,119 --> 01:37:57,099
to grow other stuff in your pots

2367
01:37:53,970 --> 01:37:58,570
monocultures are not natural yep

2368
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:01,060
no you're absolutely right that is the

2369
01:37:58,569 --> 01:38:03,130
answer but there are still people

2370
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:04,660
there's holdouts that don't wanna you

2371
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:06,489
know don't want to have to fuss with it

2372
01:38:04,659 --> 01:38:09,189
with the other crops because they can

2373
01:38:06,489 --> 01:38:11,109
inadvertently become banker play or not

2374
01:38:09,189 --> 01:38:13,419
banker plants but try plants and and

2375
01:38:11,109 --> 01:38:14,739
bring in other pests into your your

2376
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:17,109
atmosphere well you definitely need to

2377
01:38:14,739 --> 01:38:22,300
choose your cover crops carefully that's

2378
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:23,789
that that part is shirt for sure but but

2379
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:27,100
it's hard but it is hard to go wrong

2380
01:38:23,789 --> 01:38:28,479
yeah and again you know if you're in a

2381
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:30,460
situation where you don't want to deal

2382
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:32,829
with cover crop just get an old towel

2383
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:34,569
soaking wet and you know put that around

2384
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:37,000
the top of the pot so that so that it

2385
01:38:34,569 --> 01:38:39,849
holds the moisture in and that will

2386
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:46,720
prevent that hydrophobic problem in the

2387
01:38:39,850 --> 01:38:50,079
first place so so you're what causes the

2388
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:52,360
pot to go hydrophobic like like what is

2389
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:54,250
the thing that people need to not do

2390
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:56,710
we've talked about solving it we've

2391
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:59,739
talked about using the cover crop and

2392
01:38:56,710 --> 01:39:02,770
we've talked about putting the blanket

2393
01:38:59,739 --> 01:39:06,539
on it but you know we can even like say

2394
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:10,690
me for example what did I do to cause

2395
01:39:06,539 --> 01:39:14,859
the top layer to go sis

2396
01:39:10,689 --> 01:39:18,039
and and have that waxy top what did I do

2397
01:39:14,859 --> 01:39:20,579
wrong that caused it other than just not

2398
01:39:18,039 --> 01:39:22,899
having a cover crop humidity and Sun

2399
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:25,000
humidity Sun and wind that's what's

2400
01:39:22,899 --> 01:39:27,670
causing it when when when the wind blows

2401
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,649
across soil I'm it the amount of

2402
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:31,720
moisture that it pulls out of that soil

2403
01:39:29,649 --> 01:39:34,239
is crazy I mean I used to do these

2404
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:35,770
monster landscapes you know for these

2405
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:37,329
billionaires and you know we'd be

2406
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:40,090
working right straight through whatever

2407
01:39:37,329 --> 01:39:41,979
season it was and we'd always get like

2408
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:43,539
and so if we got the spring you know mud

2409
01:39:41,979 --> 01:39:45,819
season it was a nightmare to try to

2410
01:39:43,539 --> 01:39:48,220
spread soils so I would have to be so

2411
01:39:45,819 --> 01:39:51,969
careful to have the blender not blended

2412
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:54,400
when there was a rainstorm coming or or

2413
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:57,640
even in some cases not try to spread it

2414
01:39:54,399 --> 01:40:00,009
on the surface of the existing soil

2415
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:02,350
until the wind came in and dried it out

2416
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:04,449
I mean I'd shut job down a number of

2417
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:06,160
times because of these conditions and

2418
01:40:04,449 --> 01:40:07,840
the Builder would freak the owner would

2419
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:09,970
freak and I'd be like look you guys if I

2420
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:12,010
don't do this I'm gonna turn this into a

2421
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:13,270
mud bath and then you're really gonna

2422
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:14,770
have a problem because everything's

2423
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:17,350
gonna be rotted and you're gonna be

2424
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:20,050
killing plants and so that moist out

2425
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:23,110
wind going across the top of that soil

2426
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:25,690
surface is probably the biggest thing

2427
01:40:23,109 --> 01:40:28,149
second would be the Sun and of course

2428
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:32,049
lastly the humidity if you do not have a

2429
01:40:28,149 --> 01:40:35,529
relative humidity meter in your tent or

2430
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:38,289
in your greenhouse then you never know

2431
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:40,750
how much moisture is being stolen off

2432
01:40:38,289 --> 01:40:43,479
the top of that pot because of lack of

2433
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:45,399
humidity in the air so those those are

2434
01:40:43,479 --> 01:40:48,939
the three reasons wasn't you it was the

2435
01:40:45,399 --> 01:40:53,619
environment it was wind is on or or

2436
01:40:48,939 --> 01:40:57,219
relative humidity so how much does it

2437
01:40:53,619 --> 01:41:01,779
matter the temperature of the water when

2438
01:40:57,220 --> 01:41:05,289
we water the plant oh great question I'm

2439
01:41:01,779 --> 01:41:07,449
a big fan of room temperature so you

2440
01:41:05,289 --> 01:41:08,680
know if you're in a greenhouse I would

2441
01:41:07,449 --> 01:41:12,130
just let it sit out in the greenhouse

2442
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:14,350
before I used it if you're in a tent you

2443
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:16,690
know you you're probably at 68 degrees

2444
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:19,450
again room temperature you don't want to

2445
01:41:16,689 --> 01:41:21,069
shock anything it's like if you poured

2446
01:41:19,449 --> 01:41:22,899
cold water on your plant it's not gonna

2447
01:41:21,069 --> 01:41:23,229
like it or if you pour boiling water on

2448
01:41:22,899 --> 01:41:25,389
you

2449
01:41:23,229 --> 01:41:27,279
it's not gonna like it so you want to

2450
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:30,850
have that water as close to the

2451
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:33,219
temperature of the soil as you possibly

2452
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:35,440
can get so that's that's a that was a

2453
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:38,230
really good question so is there any

2454
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:40,238
advantage to bubbling the water first to

2455
01:41:38,229 --> 01:41:43,149
aerate it I know that some people do

2456
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,738
that to get rid of you know the chlorine

2457
01:41:43,149 --> 01:41:46,299
and I know that other folks do it

2458
01:41:44,738 --> 01:41:48,459
because they're actually gonna make you

2459
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:50,650
know put some compost tea into it

2460
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:52,000
but then I also know some people that do

2461
01:41:50,649 --> 01:41:54,369
it because they're like oh I want to

2462
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:58,149
take more oxygen down to the root zone

2463
01:41:54,369 --> 01:42:00,099
so I'm gonna bubble by water to extra

2464
01:41:58,149 --> 01:42:01,869
aerate it before I put it in there and I

2465
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:03,579
don't know if that's scientifically

2466
01:42:01,869 --> 01:42:06,579
sound what do you think oh absolutely

2467
01:42:03,579 --> 01:42:09,369
absolutely sound you can build the

2468
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:11,649
dissolved oxygen in a water column

2469
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:14,800
through aeration and that's why you do

2470
01:42:11,649 --> 01:42:16,238
it in a fish tank because the fish I'm

2471
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,190
getting into biology again but the

2472
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:22,929
breakdown of those you know the nitrogen

2473
01:42:18,189 --> 01:42:26,349
cycle is creating co2 and so the only

2474
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:28,210
way to get the co2 dissolved the oxygen

2475
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:30,520
level up high enough to support the fish

2476
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:32,739
life depending on the amount of biomass

2477
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:34,150
obviously the more fish the more

2478
01:42:32,738 --> 01:42:36,099
bubblers the more air stones you're

2479
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:37,899
going to need so know I'm a huge fan of

2480
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:40,120
bubbling the water first and then

2481
01:42:37,899 --> 01:42:42,159
applying it because yes you are bringing

2482
01:42:40,119 --> 01:42:44,829
down a higher level of dissolved oxygen

2483
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:46,389
into the soil system I think I touched

2484
01:42:44,829 --> 01:42:48,880
on this last time I did an experiment

2485
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:52,770
way back when where I measure dissolved

2486
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:55,119
oxygen in a raindrop in a sprinkler so

2487
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:58,870
one of those rotary sprinklers that come

2488
01:42:55,119 --> 01:43:03,010
out of the ground and go and water in a

2489
01:42:58,869 --> 01:43:05,559
pipe and then water in a drip irrigation

2490
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:08,380
tube it was amazing the dissolved oxygen

2491
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:11,140
level in the raindrop was 23 parts per

2492
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:14,529
million in the sprinkler I think it was

2493
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:16,750
15 I'm out of the faucet it was about

2494
01:43:14,529 --> 01:43:19,300
eight and in the end of the drip

2495
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:22,149
irrigation pipe it was six anaerobic six

2496
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:24,250
five to six so it was anaerobic so we

2497
01:43:22,149 --> 01:43:26,670
know you can build that water molecule

2498
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:29,289
up I mean there's a stairs of great

2499
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:31,390
video showing what happens to a water

2500
01:43:29,289 --> 01:43:34,170
droplet as it travels through the

2501
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:36,449
atmosphere and it rolls over on itself

2502
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:38,640
don't it so it's constantly pulling in

2503
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:42,000
oxygen as it's tumbling through the air

2504
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:43,170
so no big fan of it definitely aerate

2505
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,140
your water if you possibly can because

2506
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:48,000
that will help to support the life in

2507
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:50,400
the soil especially if you have a really

2508
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,000
good living soil system and you don't

2509
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:56,849
have earthworms or a way for that soil

2510
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,920
to really build the tilth out of the

2511
01:43:56,850 --> 01:44:00,810
gate then bubble your water so that your

2512
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,029
help to feed those those organisms that

2513
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:04,980
extra oxygen so they can in turn build

2514
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:07,800
that tilt and allow that soil to

2515
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:10,500
respirating let's talk about a method of

2516
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:12,239
watering you know you know everybody

2517
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:17,250
said Larry I shouldn't say everybody

2518
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:20,879
there is a certain contingent in the

2519
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:24,510
home growing scene that demands hand

2520
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:26,730
watering and and I and you know some of

2521
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:28,619
that is because of the effect of the you

2522
01:44:26,729 --> 01:44:30,659
know hand watering and just giving the

2523
01:44:28,619 --> 01:44:33,179
plant as much as it needs but I also

2524
01:44:30,659 --> 01:44:36,090
think a lot of it is that people like me

2525
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:38,609
who believe that a plant thrives more

2526
01:44:36,090 --> 01:44:41,010
when you spend a little time with it

2527
01:44:38,609 --> 01:44:45,738
every day and you you know you're more

2528
01:44:41,010 --> 01:44:48,539
aware of your pest pressure and you know

2529
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:50,698
changing color of leaves that might show

2530
01:44:48,539 --> 01:44:53,399
that you might be missing some nutrient

2531
01:44:50,698 --> 01:44:55,710
but all that comes with the moment that

2532
01:44:53,399 --> 01:44:57,509
you spent with that plant but we also

2533
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:59,850
you know while while I have not used

2534
01:44:57,510 --> 01:45:01,800
blue mat yet you know my friends are

2535
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:03,600
saying great things about them but then

2536
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:06,270
when you scale up it's much much

2537
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:09,600
difficult much more difficult to do hand

2538
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:12,989
watering and and people shift up to

2539
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:16,760
commercial scale drip lines and things

2540
01:45:12,988 --> 01:45:20,099
like that is there really a difference

2541
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:23,429
to the plant which one you use or is

2542
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:26,460
this really simply economies of scale

2543
01:45:23,429 --> 01:45:28,350
and and how this impacts your labor does

2544
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:31,409
it really matter to the plant what which

2545
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:33,810
one we use the only problem with hand

2546
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:36,329
watering is seeing consistency unless

2547
01:45:33,810 --> 01:45:38,640
you're sitting there counting each plant

2548
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:39,929
how long it you took to water it then

2549
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:41,340
some are gonna get a little bit extra

2550
01:45:39,929 --> 01:45:43,800
water and some are gonna be a little

2551
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:45,480
less water I get the concept of being

2552
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:47,219
you know out there with the plant and

2553
01:45:45,479 --> 01:45:48,319
I'm a big proponent of being a farmer

2554
01:45:47,219 --> 01:45:49,939
shadow-like

2555
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:51,349
you guys need to be in you with your

2556
01:45:49,939 --> 01:45:52,848
plants all the time there are the

2557
01:45:51,349 --> 01:45:54,619
extremists that say oh just leave the

2558
01:45:52,849 --> 01:45:56,900
plane alone let the plant do its work

2559
01:45:54,618 --> 01:45:59,299
yeah I get that too but in in a mono

2560
01:45:56,899 --> 01:46:00,948
cropping situation you're asking for

2561
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:04,070
problems I mean if you're if you're

2562
01:46:00,948 --> 01:46:05,750
highly regen and you've got all kinds of

2563
01:46:04,069 --> 01:46:07,908
different plants and diversity around

2564
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:09,349
your cannabis you're gonna be okay

2565
01:46:07,908 --> 01:46:11,658
you're not gonna have the kind of pest

2566
01:46:09,349 --> 01:46:14,179
pressure that can happen with a mono

2567
01:46:11,658 --> 01:46:16,339
cropping system and I believe that the

2568
01:46:14,179 --> 01:46:18,500
hand watering comes in because it's

2569
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:20,900
forcing you to spend time with each and

2570
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:23,238
every one of those plants so it's a good

2571
01:46:20,899 --> 01:46:25,549
practice sure but you've got to be

2572
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:27,198
careful because humans are humans and if

2573
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:28,880
you start daydreaming for a minute and

2574
01:46:27,198 --> 01:46:31,549
lose your count well now you're gonna

2575
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:35,060
overwater or underwater so you know it's

2576
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:37,579
it's a matter of being a more diligent

2577
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:39,889
in in spending your time but in this

2578
01:46:37,578 --> 01:46:42,109
case the reason I love the blue mats are

2579
01:46:39,889 --> 01:46:43,789
is because they're non-mechanical it's a

2580
01:46:42,109 --> 01:46:46,488
lights it the only thing that's driving

2581
01:46:43,789 --> 01:46:49,340
it is that ceramic when that ceramic

2582
01:46:46,488 --> 01:46:51,678
gets to a certain level of moisture it

2583
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:53,779
either calls from warm moisture or it

2584
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:56,149
shuts off and prevents more moisture

2585
01:46:53,779 --> 01:46:59,630
from coming out so it's a brainless way

2586
01:46:56,149 --> 01:47:02,629
of maintaining a certain way soil

2587
01:46:59,630 --> 01:47:04,489
moisture level that's that's unique to

2588
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:05,929
anything I've ever seen on the market so

2589
01:47:04,488 --> 01:47:09,738
that's why I'm a big fan of it because

2590
01:47:05,929 --> 01:47:11,719
it takes the guesswork out so this

2591
01:47:09,738 --> 01:47:14,238
should be good in the category of

2592
01:47:11,719 --> 01:47:18,139
guesswork you just said if you get

2593
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:20,629
distracted and you lose your count when

2594
01:47:18,139 --> 01:47:22,699
you're hand watering dude I don't even

2595
01:47:20,630 --> 01:47:27,349
have a count I didn't even think about

2596
01:47:22,698 --> 01:47:29,509
that as you know I I hand water and I'm

2597
01:47:27,349 --> 01:47:31,699
watching it and I'm like man looks about

2598
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:33,710
right low and I'm thinking to myself oh

2599
01:47:31,698 --> 01:47:36,618
my god no wonder I've got watering

2600
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:38,239
issues all the time so so how do you

2601
01:47:36,618 --> 01:47:42,109
come to a water how do you come to a

2602
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:44,059
count basically you got to start with

2603
01:47:42,109 --> 01:47:46,729
obviously sticking your finger in the

2604
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:48,380
soil and if you're not good at if you're

2605
01:47:46,729 --> 01:47:50,178
not good enough at that yet another

2606
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:53,779
trick is to take a handful of the soil

2607
01:47:50,179 --> 01:47:55,578
and squeeze it as hard as you can and if

2608
01:47:53,779 --> 01:47:57,738
you get water dropping out of it it's

2609
01:47:55,578 --> 01:47:59,868
too much water you should be able to

2610
01:47:57,738 --> 01:48:01,059
just get a little bit of a slick spot at

2611
01:47:59,868 --> 01:48:03,039
the bottom where your

2612
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:05,110
squeezing it but it shouldn't drip out

2613
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:06,550
of it and it obviously it should hold

2614
01:48:05,109 --> 01:48:08,529
together it shouldn't just you know

2615
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:11,170
crumble or span back to its original

2616
01:48:08,529 --> 01:48:13,750
size very quickly so that that's a great

2617
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:16,810
way of determining the moisture content

2618
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:19,359
of where your sweet spot is but as far

2619
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:20,590
as as hand watering that again depends

2620
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:22,899
on your soil system if you're all

2621
01:48:20,590 --> 01:48:25,390
potting soil or we call it the soilless

2622
01:48:22,899 --> 01:48:28,059
medium that's gonna take more moisture

2623
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:29,920
and again problem is surface it's gonna

2624
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:33,070
go hydrophobic and the internals gonna

2625
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:35,470
go anaerobic so that's why I push that a

2626
01:48:33,069 --> 01:48:38,590
horizon is so critical in this and that

2627
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:40,600
a horizons gonna help you maintain an

2628
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:42,489
equal moisture profile from the bottom

2629
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:44,920
of the pot to the top of the pot so

2630
01:48:42,489 --> 01:48:47,319
again it depends on your soil matrix as

2631
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:51,310
to you know what the count might look

2632
01:48:47,319 --> 01:48:53,380
like but it's pretty easy to you know if

2633
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:55,060
once you start to realize what the

2634
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:56,590
moisture should feel like you'll get

2635
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:57,910
comfortable with it you'll be able to

2636
01:48:56,590 --> 01:48:59,409
just walk up stick your finger in the

2637
01:48:57,909 --> 01:49:01,000
pot up this one needs a little moisture

2638
01:48:59,409 --> 01:49:02,859
and go to the next one this one doesn't

2639
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,050
because you know another thing too is

2640
01:49:02,859 --> 01:49:06,789
that these plants are going to react

2641
01:49:05,050 --> 01:49:09,190
differently one might transfer eight

2642
01:49:06,789 --> 01:49:11,739
based on the cultivar differently than

2643
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:14,289
another one you know what some of them

2644
01:49:11,739 --> 01:49:16,420
are used to higher tolerance of heat

2645
01:49:14,289 --> 01:49:18,430
some of them are less you you know you

2646
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:20,500
know all this I mean the cultivars are

2647
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:22,930
also going to drive you know what that

2648
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:24,460
moisture level looks like but I'm start

2649
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:26,409
with that squeezing trick that's a good

2650
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:27,939
one and and then eventually move into

2651
01:49:26,409 --> 01:49:29,800
that being able to just stick your

2652
01:49:27,939 --> 01:49:31,119
finger in there until you feel that that

2653
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,949
moisture level and you'll get

2654
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:34,630
comfortable with it yeah I think what

2655
01:49:32,949 --> 01:49:37,300
I'm gonna do is I think I'll go I'll go

2656
01:49:34,630 --> 01:49:39,609
down the line of pots and and give them

2657
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:41,860
different counts and then go back in ten

2658
01:49:39,609 --> 01:49:44,439
minutes and do the squeeze test that you

2659
01:49:41,859 --> 01:49:46,269
described and then I'll know what my

2660
01:49:44,439 --> 01:49:49,239
right count is cuz that'll be the pot

2661
01:49:46,270 --> 01:49:50,650
that's reacting properly yeah and and I

2662
01:49:49,239 --> 01:49:52,779
would even wait longer I'd wait a couple

2663
01:49:50,649 --> 01:49:56,049
hours you know to let let the moisture

2664
01:49:52,779 --> 01:49:58,389
you know migrate down into the into the

2665
01:49:56,050 --> 01:50:00,579
bottom of the pot and then feel it so

2666
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:03,900
turn water them wait a couple hours and

2667
01:50:00,579 --> 01:50:03,899
then go back and check it out and

2668
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:09,750
so certainly people water in compost tea

2669
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:12,300
right they'll they'll do some compost

2670
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:15,000
tea first and then they will water their

2671
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:20,310
plant to water it in what do you think

2672
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:22,770
about like having your water be compost

2673
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:25,500
tea is there a need for the fresh water

2674
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:28,230
in addition to just compost tea or like

2675
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:30,359
add they both have got water in them um

2676
01:50:28,229 --> 01:50:33,929
they both have water in them but I you

2677
01:50:30,359 --> 01:50:35,909
know I if I'm using a concentrate so one

2678
01:50:33,930 --> 01:50:37,680
of my products is a liquid concentrate

2679
01:50:35,909 --> 01:50:39,869
then I definitely water it in

2680
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:41,909
I mean I've turned grasp purple like

2681
01:50:39,869 --> 01:50:43,500
literally purple because I put so much

2682
01:50:41,909 --> 01:50:45,988
on it cuz I wanted to see what was gonna

2683
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:49,319
happen and the colors of the grass came

2684
01:50:45,988 --> 01:50:51,089
out and it just screamed it turned so

2685
01:50:49,319 --> 01:50:52,439
dark green that it was almost purple and

2686
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:54,270
I was like wow look at that

2687
01:50:52,439 --> 01:50:59,369
yeah the clients not gonna like that I

2688
01:50:54,270 --> 01:51:01,560
better water but again you know going

2689
01:50:59,369 --> 01:51:03,988
back to compost teas as long as you have

2690
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:05,610
biology then I would say yeah it's not

2691
01:51:03,988 --> 01:51:08,039
gonna hurt to just give it a spritz

2692
01:51:05,609 --> 01:51:10,289
after to try to move those droplets of

2693
01:51:08,039 --> 01:51:12,449
compost heap down into the soil profile

2694
01:51:10,289 --> 01:51:13,979
where they belong cuz they don't belong

2695
01:51:12,449 --> 01:51:16,139
on the surface yeah on the surface

2696
01:51:13,979 --> 01:51:18,359
they're just gonna die from the air in

2697
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:21,030
the UVs and everything else so no I

2698
01:51:18,359 --> 01:51:23,719
totally get the the practice of watering

2699
01:51:21,029 --> 01:51:26,189
in when I was doing a lot of

2700
01:51:23,719 --> 01:51:27,750
installation of product what I would do

2701
01:51:26,189 --> 01:51:29,879
is I would make you know obviously my

2702
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:32,189
concentrate I would add 10 gallons the

2703
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:35,190
concentrate then I would add you know

2704
01:51:32,189 --> 01:51:37,349
110 gallons water a little bit of foods

2705
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:39,238
and then I would just go apply it but I

2706
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:42,210
would apply it heavily so I would do a

2707
01:51:39,238 --> 01:51:44,939
soil drench so some of it was getting

2708
01:51:42,210 --> 01:51:47,730
the the continuous spraying on top of it

2709
01:51:44,939 --> 01:51:49,259
would push the the first spray down into

2710
01:51:47,729 --> 01:51:51,179
the soil and I would just be like yeah

2711
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:52,980
you know whatever whatever evaporates or

2712
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:54,659
whatever you v's kill these little guys

2713
01:51:52,979 --> 01:51:57,659
I'm not going to be concerned about it

2714
01:51:54,659 --> 01:52:01,019
because I'd rent the soil so I

2715
01:51:57,659 --> 01:52:02,488
inadvertently moved those the organisms

2716
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:03,590
down into the lower profile that I

2717
01:52:02,488 --> 01:52:06,269
wanted to

2718
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:07,650
fantastic well Layton thank you so much

2719
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:11,040
for sharing your time I know you're

2720
01:52:07,649 --> 01:52:12,420
you're on the road and consulting a lot

2721
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:14,369
actually maybe you've hit a little bit

2722
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:15,989
less right now in quarantine actually

2723
01:52:14,369 --> 01:52:17,640
you might actually be home quite a bit

2724
01:52:15,989 --> 01:52:19,500
right now you you are normally traveling

2725
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:21,170
a lot are you even gonna be home enough

2726
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:23,819
to put into a food garden this year

2727
01:52:21,170 --> 01:52:27,420
funny you should say that I have done it

2728
01:52:23,819 --> 01:52:29,309
I mean it's it's been God 32 years more

2729
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:31,560
since the last time I had the

2730
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:33,150
opportunity to plan a garden so yeah

2731
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,740
I've been planning gardening with

2732
01:52:33,149 --> 01:52:36,179
Pauline and our dog he's out there

2733
01:52:34,739 --> 01:52:38,729
helping me with the soil I mean it's

2734
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:40,650
hilarious and so I'm actually enjoying

2735
01:52:38,729 --> 01:52:42,779
the quarantine I'm definitely not

2736
01:52:40,649 --> 01:52:44,429
working as hard or earning as much as I

2737
01:52:42,779 --> 01:52:46,710
would like to but you know it's this is

2738
01:52:44,430 --> 01:52:48,600
all gonna you know Peter out eventually

2739
01:52:46,710 --> 01:52:51,000
and I will be able to get back on the

2740
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:52,590
road and help other folks out across the

2741
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,470
country but for right now I'm enjoying

2742
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:58,770
it I mean I'm so blessed that I can

2743
01:52:55,470 --> 01:53:00,090
still support myself I've made enough

2744
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:02,660
money that I'm not gonna be you know

2745
01:53:00,090 --> 01:53:05,610
freaking out that I can't pay my bills

2746
01:53:02,659 --> 01:53:08,729
so I'm taking the time I'm meditating

2747
01:53:05,609 --> 01:53:10,710
playing in the soil taking walks and you

2748
01:53:08,729 --> 01:53:12,539
know life is great I'm enjoying the

2749
01:53:10,710 --> 01:53:13,590
quarantine I'm sorry for everybody out

2750
01:53:12,539 --> 01:53:15,600
there that suffering because I know

2751
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:16,860
there's so many people that are you know

2752
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:20,430
that we're living paycheck to paycheck

2753
01:53:16,859 --> 01:53:22,079
and are totally screwed right now and

2754
01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:24,329
it's sad it's it's horrible

2755
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:26,340
but uh you know I'm taking it with

2756
01:53:24,329 --> 01:53:28,529
stride and I'm trying to stay positive

2757
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:30,150
and send out good vibrations to

2758
01:53:28,529 --> 01:53:32,069
everybody but yeah I'm actually I am

2759
01:53:30,149 --> 01:53:34,409
growing a food garden it really is

2760
01:53:32,069 --> 01:53:37,590
interesting to see the revival of the

2761
01:53:34,409 --> 01:53:39,329
Victory Garden right the long-term joke

2762
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:41,250
is that cannabis is a gateway to

2763
01:53:39,329 --> 01:53:45,180
horticulture right and there's all these

2764
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:47,279
like new home growers that are suddenly

2765
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:49,200
going well I was able to grow a little

2766
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:51,359
bit of weed let me see what else I can

2767
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:53,939
do and all that all the seed companies

2768
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:57,179
are breaking new records for seed sales

2769
01:53:53,939 --> 01:53:59,699
and you know even though there's the

2770
01:53:57,180 --> 01:54:02,630
vast majority of what's going on

2771
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:06,779
with the pandemic is obviously terrible

2772
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:08,730
it does make me feel a some measure

2773
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:10,559
better that people are learning how to

2774
01:54:08,729 --> 01:54:13,229
grow their own foods which we should

2775
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:16,110
never have lost that skill and and

2776
01:54:13,229 --> 01:54:16,859
hopefully that is something that can

2777
01:54:16,109 --> 01:54:19,769
continue

2778
01:54:16,859 --> 01:54:21,329
moving forward for all of us and thank

2779
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:23,310
you for bringing that up that is such an

2780
01:54:21,329 --> 01:54:25,380
important point you know we all should

2781
01:54:23,310 --> 01:54:28,230
be having at least nerve garden if not

2782
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:30,329
at least a few veggies and it's it's not

2783
01:54:28,229 --> 01:54:32,250
a lot of work it's not that hard to do

2784
01:54:30,329 --> 01:54:34,380
this whether it's in a pot or or it's

2785
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:36,180
planted in the soil and that's providing

2786
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:37,319
food security and you're right about the

2787
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:39,690
seed companies I mean they're out of

2788
01:54:37,319 --> 01:54:41,549
everything and so you know I gotta

2789
01:54:39,689 --> 01:54:43,439
believe that the vast majority of people

2790
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:45,060
across this country are growing these

2791
01:54:43,439 --> 01:54:48,509
Victory Gardens which is great and

2792
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:50,280
hopefully that never changes because we

2793
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:51,930
can control the inputs of what's going

2794
01:54:50,279 --> 01:54:52,619
into these veggies and we know that

2795
01:54:51,930 --> 01:54:55,020
they're healthy

2796
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:56,849
so no I'm glad you brought that up that

2797
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:59,640
was great yeah well it wasn't intended I

2798
01:54:56,850 --> 01:55:01,980
just kind of stumbled into it cuz cuz

2799
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:03,810
that's how we are so right on so thanks
