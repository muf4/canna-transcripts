1
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:07,570
so this next question is a manufacturing

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,339
question because you know I know that

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,769
you have hunted terpenes and done big

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:14,750
sips your whole life and you know the

5
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:16,789
value of a really good terpene right and

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,190
so when it comes to extraction you know

7
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:22,368
almost all of us lean towards really

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,779
clean whole plant cannabis extractions

9
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:25,939
to get our chirps but if you're making

10
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:28,009
edibles and you want to add some

11
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:30,740
terpenes to that the price point doesn't

12
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:32,659
make sense to do cannabis extracted all

13
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:35,570
the time and so so you've got different

14
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,489
levels of terpene both extraction

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,960
processes and whether or not their

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,630
cannabis sourced or whether or not

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,950
they're there food source and a lot of

18
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,460
folks get confused you know they'll just

19
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,930
bash one or the other without

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,600
understanding that when you are trying

21
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:53,390
to design a product to bring it to the

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,460
mass market yeah it can't just be cool

23
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,679
it has to work on the spreadsheet as

24
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,500
well so when you are helping your

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,500
clients think through what level and

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,849
what source of terpene to choose you

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,090
know how do you help them think through

28
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,099
that challenge you when it comes to that

29
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,049
that's just pure business because once

30
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:14,809
we start to say we're gonna go from

31
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:18,679
whole plant full extract to where we're

32
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,748
gonna do crude distillate added turps it

33
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,219
becomes how much what's the price point

34
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,259
of the product that's going to get sold

35
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:25,788
downstream and we have to go all the way

36
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:27,259
backwards through the chain to figure

37
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:29,989
out what do you have to sell it for it

38
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,998
in order to be profitable and with with

39
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,589
these questions before we're always done

40
00:01:31,998 --> 00:01:34,699
with like don't anybody talk about the

41
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,409
dirty product we're going to put in

42
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,960
right but now with testing no matter

43
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:40,759
what it has to be clean and so I don't

44
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,438
have any issue with with plant derived

45
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,478
Terps because fundamentally for me

46
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:46,638
people people that have little money

47
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,590
shouldn't be precluded from using

48
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:51,560
cannabis and so if all they can afford

49
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,469
is bulk cannabis that was cleanly

50
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,388
extracted and then someone like Ben from

51
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:59,658
true terpenes who does some really nice

52
00:01:56,388 --> 00:02:01,390
work who's about it he lays you out a

53
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,650
floral pattern that is red

54
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,840
shann you consume it you go by that's

55
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,550
beautiful and it's way more affordable

56
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,379
than steam distilled Terps that you

57
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:10,868
derived or you did closed-loop and you

58
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,430
pull them off and put them back in if

59
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:14,409
that's not your price point that's not

60
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,659
your price point but if your price point

61
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:18,009
is that and that's what you're selling

62
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:19,990
then that's what you focus on I think

63
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,879
that the fight you hear so much is

64
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,379
because each individual believes that

65
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,719
their system is what works best for them

66
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:28,329
and it does but it doesn't it doesn't

67
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,759
diminish either or they're two radically

68
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,820
different worlds and you just have to

69
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,649
understand why you're doing it and

70
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,359
what's the end goal and what is the

71
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,519
price that it's going to sell for and

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,950
when you when you look at it like that

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,810
it becomes a question you asked your

74
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:45,609
accountant so you sit down with your

75
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,370
accountant what kind of trips can I

76
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,769
afford can't afford and what is my real

77
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,810
margin on the sale and when it starts to

78
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:54,250
become too low to be profitable you know

79
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,719
that you can't do that that's just an

80
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,610
emotional response that's something you

81
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,400
would do for yourself privately for your

82
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,260
own stash but you definitely can't sell

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,060
it like that and so I don't see any

84
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:06,399
issue with any of the different

85
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,900
formulations because really what it does

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
is it allows you to deal with the

87
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,789
reality of income you have people who

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,939
make very little who are in pain and

89
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:17,919
could use homeopathic pain relief they

90
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:20,169
have psychological issues either

91
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,548
depression or anxiety and they can use

92
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:23,949
certain forms of cannabis to either

93
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,719
increase or decrease these things why

94
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:27,909
should they be precluded from consuming

95
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,069
when they can't afford the greatest farm

96
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,930
growing product ever done that's just

97
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,519
not fair the supermarket has food for

98
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,890
all people I think cannabis has always

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,319
historically been for all people and so

100
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:40,208
with the advent of technology it allows

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,609
you to be able to drop the cost of

102
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,069
production dramatically well that

103
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,290
doesn't mean that that it changes

104
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:50,019
everyone's reality but it allows you to

105
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:52,870
cover a large spectrum of the lower-cost

106
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:56,170
portions I don't and and as we go

107
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,469
forward there is a difference no derived

108
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,739
package

109
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:02,930
complete as the natural package and I

110
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,400
just know this from as a consumer that I

111
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,500
play with all of them and I don't care

112
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,330
which one I play with if that isn't

113
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,979
pulled off directly from the from the

114
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,830
varietal because the Terps and the

115
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:14,599
cannabinoids is a union you you you're

116
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,340
trying to take something apart trying to

117
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,659
deconstruct something and then say look

118
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,639
this is the important part the rest of

119
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,920
it wasn't there the reality is it's a

120
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,990
synthesis it's a it's a homogenous mix

121
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,660
the plant created all these things in

122
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,210
some form for some reason it has it in

123
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,070
its genealogical background to produce

124
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:32,719
these things how do they interrelate

125
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:34,279
we're not smart enough to know yet and

126
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,060
when we start to think with that smart

127
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:37,039
we already know we're going the wrong

128
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,319
way because this is too complex a

129
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,120
molecular equation so you have to just

130
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,969
say for whatever reason for reasons

131
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,949
unknown these things seem to be best in

132
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,470
this form and that's the people who can

133
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,149
discern that and afford it and when the

134
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,800
education is present then people will

135
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:53,359
know look is a reason why we pay a

136
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,340
higher price for this because of the

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,139
subtleties but for people who don't have

138
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:00,129
the money I don't see anything wrong

139
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,139
with a crude that's been cleaned and

140
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,699
derived terms that have been applied

141
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,709
just don't apply them so heavy you

142
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:08,509
creating a solvent that night my problem

143
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,769
with adding Terps back into mixes is

144
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,168
that they're going so heavy with the

145
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:14,029
turfs to create this unbelievably turf

146
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:16,219
experience that people forget that it's

147
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:18,139
a solvent especially limonene and so

148
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,400
you're adding all this citrus into your

149
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,370
product to get this incredible

150
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,439
monoterpene explosive grabbing hungry I

151
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,990
want more but we don't know what it does

152
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,668
to the lungs and so you want to make

153
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,590
sure that you're really trying to keep

154
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:32,120
it within some range and balance that's

155
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:34,789
been here because we've had so little

156
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,220
medical damage done to people using from

157
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,470
cannabis use that I believe and I talked

158
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,240
to Ben the same thing we both believe

159
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,830
that as they start to turn these dials

160
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,680
we'll see changes in how people are

161
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:47,589
affected by it and both in cannabinoid

162
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,699
levels which are unusually high and

163
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:51,978
interpret levels that are unusually high

164
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:53,539
and so we don't really have any R&amp;D on

165
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:56,430
that we're the guinea pigs and we'll

166
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,410
know as we go forward but to me you

167
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,959
as long as you turn those back to

168
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,270
realistic so that you're not trying to

169
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,639
make someone believe hey my manufactured

170
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:07,019
product that's accentuated is definitely

171
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,240
better than the real product cuz the

172
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,769
numbers are higher they may be but

173
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,490
they're radically different and subtlety

174
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:16,859
and experience and experience of the

175
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,449
smoker will determine it and money will

176
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,680
allow you to make those fine choices

177
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:21,209
it's like the difference between a

178
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,650
really high-end whiskey and a low-end

179
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:23,699
whiskey they both whiskey you drink a

180
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,409
bottle of it you're gonna know you drink

181
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,569
a bottle of whiskey and one of them is

182
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,360
absolutely alive in the mouth and the

183
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,889
other one is a little less so who can

184
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,490
afford the qualities and they'll be the

185
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,360
same here

186
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,360
Yeah right cool thank you
