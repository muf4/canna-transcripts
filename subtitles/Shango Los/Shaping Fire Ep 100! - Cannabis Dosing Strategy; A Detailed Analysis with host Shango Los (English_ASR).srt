00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,179
hello and welcome to the 100th episode

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,699
of shaping fire I am your host shangolos

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,079
before we get to the meat of the program

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,300
I'm going to take a little bit of time

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,339
here at the top of the show and share

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,320
some of the philosophy and themes behind

8
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,759
the shaping fire podcast that we've

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,980
never really talked about in the first

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,960
hundred episodes I get questions about

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,859
these things and I figure I might as

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,778
well

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,820
you know what better time than 100th

14
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,460
episode to share it with you so number

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,859
one is of course the main guide behind

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,859
the program is to make cannabis

17
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:43,079
enthusiasts self-sufficient I appreciate

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,359
that access is increasing across the

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,700
United States as normalization kind of

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,640
creeps in and and it's good to support

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,680
those stores however I also think that

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,420
patients should be able to grow and

23
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,820
produce their own medicine and

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,340
preparations at home and every episode

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,579
of shaping fire is Works towards that

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,799
goal also each episode I try to make

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,079
sure is packed with information that you

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,880
can take action on I try to include

29
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,739
everything you need in an episode to

30
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,599
make a decision or take action or at

31
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,079
least feel like you have a handle on

32
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:18,478
that topic too often I listen to a

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,579
podcast to learn and I'm only given

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,679
about 65 or 70 percent of the

35
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,560
information I actually need and so I

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,780
still have to continue my research to

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,118
fill in the holes with shaping fire

38
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,099
episodes I really try to give you

39
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,379
everything you need to start making

40
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,599
decisions and sure there's almost always

41
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,399
more research that's needed but at least

42
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,319
you know that you have the basics

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,880
covered and you can go forward on your

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,158
second layer race research with

45
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,938
confidence

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,659
um I book shaping fire episodes or my

47
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:53,699
guests based on topics and I don't do

48
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,320
company profiles and I don't do people

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,540
profiles

50
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,578
um I find a topic that I'm interested

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,460
and I think that the audience would be

52
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:05,758
interested in and that is undercovered

53
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,798
in cannabis media after I've got that

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,259
topic and whether I want what I want to

55
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,719
cover I then go and find a guest who is

56
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,878
an industry expert in that area and then

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,979
I invite them on the show

58
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,739
um every week I get lots of people

59
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:22,139
interested in being on the show or their

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,300
press agents and and they let me know

61
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,299
that this person is very interesting

62
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,939
except shaping fire is not about that

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,099
person shaping fires about cannabis

64
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,159
patients and those are the people who

65
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:37,919
are important and so I see my role as a

66
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,020
role of service bringing you topics that

67
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,399
you are interested in learning in and

68
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,800
then we just go and find the right

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,659
person for it before people are on my

70
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,580
show we have a conversation so they too

71
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,519
understand that this show is not about

72
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,379
them and it's not about me is this doing

73
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,819
this show is a role of service for

74
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:57,780
cannabis patients and that's how we

75
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:59,939
treat it and people who don't work in

76
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,878
that way they don't end up on shaping

77
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,219
fire so that's how I choose guests

78
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:07,439
similarly I choose my advertisers based

79
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,318
on those same kinds of morals I choose

80
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,060
advertisers that have a message or a

81
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,518
product that I actually think that

82
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,439
regenerative minded cannabis users are

83
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,680
going to be interested in and so because

84
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:23,878
of that you don't see me accepting money

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,680
from a bottled salt fertilizer companies

86
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,598
and boy do they want to be on the show

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,540
and gosh if I had to turn down a lot of

88
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:33,479
money but it would be very difficult for

89
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:37,378
me to have all these regenerative guests

90
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:40,500
and then cut to an commercial that is

91
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:42,719
some kind of a plus b salt nutrient for

92
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,598
indoor it just would be out of Integrity

93
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,378
for me and so I don't do it

94
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,959
um

95
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,518
online I don't fight with trolls I just

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,439
restrict them and move on with my life

97
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,739
you know a lot of people really get into

98
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,180
the fight online and I just don't I just

99
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,158
don't have the energy for it I don't

100
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,379
like that feeling of stress in the

101
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,959
middle of my chest when when people are

102
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:07,199
involved in online fighting so so I just

103
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,299
I just don't even respond and I block

104
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,979
them or restrict them and get on with my

105
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,438
life I got way more important things to

106
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:16,199
do than than internet fighting

107
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:19,620
my first podcast my first 55 of them

108
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,419
were actually for entrepreneur.com

109
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,939
um I worked with them for a year doing

110
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:26,279
weekly shows and I recommend that you go

111
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,740
over to entrepreneur.com and check those

112
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,719
out um I love the guys there

113
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,400
um but you know I realized that I was

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,400
pretty darn good at this podcasting

115
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,159
thing and I wanted to own all my own

116
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,258
intellectual property so I said goodbye

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,900
to the fellas and I wish them best and

118
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,479
we're all still friends and uh and I

119
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,758
formed shaping fire so that I could be

120
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:50,039
in control of my own destiny choose my

121
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,379
own advertisers own my own intellectual

122
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,000
property and move forward and now five

123
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,978
years in I think that was a great

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,439
decision and uh happily I've been met

125
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:01,199
with a lot of success and can support

126
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,779
myself off the show

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,780
I've also done 100 episodes of shaping

128
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,879
fire over the last five years 20 per

129
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:12,059
year roughly twice a month with a break

130
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,899
around Christmas so at 20 episodes a

131
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,300
year

132
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,339
um it's certainly not as fast as many

133
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,740
podcasts that have got weekly or even

134
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,379
daily episodes I've just never been

135
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,759
interested in that and I spend too much

136
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,978
time curating my content and and finding

137
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,419
um difficult to find guests and then

138
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:31,978
reading their books before they're on

139
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,500
the show or if they're a scientist all

140
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,599
their scientific papers and

141
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,399
um doing lots of episodes has just never

142
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,439
been attracted to me attractive to me

143
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,599
I'd rather do less shows and have them

144
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,519
be more in depth and that's that isn't

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,280
to to shame anybody else's show like

146
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,519
there's lots of room in this scene for

147
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,439
lots of different shows and people love

148
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,379
different types of entertainment and

149
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,120
education so while shaping fire isn't

150
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:58,379
the show that I'm going to be smoking

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,240
out with the guest and we're going to be

152
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,439
talking about what we're smoking on

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,900
um there's certainly a place for that

154
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,839
and I think that there's enough room for

155
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,538
everybody and certainly

156
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:10,859
um my audience appreciates how how I

157
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:12,719
approach things

158
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,520
there's also the YouTube channel in case

159
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,639
you're not familiar with that there's

160
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,799
almost 200 videos of um

161
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,478
various speakers speaking on cannabis

162
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,280
and entheogens

163
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:24,899
um and it's kind of funny because the

164
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,339
the YouTube channel was an accident

165
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,818
actually

166
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:33,359
um when I started traveling back in 2015

167
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:36,000
or so people were flying me out to speak

168
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,259
at cannabis conventions

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,819
um you know since I was at the cannabis

170
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,879
convention I was also going to see

171
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:44,039
really good speakers and it seemed like

172
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,918
a waste to not record them so every time

173
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,560
I went to see a speaker I also recorded

174
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,139
the speaker so that I could bring home

175
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,600
that content to you so you could enjoy

176
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:57,360
it without ever having to travel and so

177
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,240
I started dumping those videos onto the

178
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,939
YouTube channel and you know eventually

179
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,918
more and more people started watching

180
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,319
them and subscribing and you know we've

181
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,899
got over 10 000 subscribers now I think

182
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,580
we're at like 13 000 perhaps and you

183
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,939
know over over a million and a half

184
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,639
minutes served and you know serving 30

185
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,620
to 40 000 people a month so that's

186
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,900
pretty good it doesn't generate any

187
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,939
money at all but it's just a good

188
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,279
resource for people and and I'm glad we

189
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,139
started it all that time ago

190
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,418
I talk in this episode a lot about

191
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,060
patients I've been involved with and I

192
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:34,439
have but I don't practice medicine I'm

193
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,199
not a doctor

194
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,598
um or do I have an office nor do I

195
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,598
charge a fee for these consultations so

196
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,240
you'll hear me refer to patients a lot

197
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:48,659
in this episode and this is simply

198
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,960
because when you are interviewing

199
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,759
medical doctors and scientists

200
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,519
every week

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,439
and then speaking about that publicly

202
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,318
you start to attract people with

203
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,500
questions and stories and then I tend to

204
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,080
keep in contact with people and so it's

205
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,779
been over this decade of learning from

206
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,758
patients that I have been able to amass

207
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,879
this knowledge for myself as a cannabis

208
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,460
patient and to help the people around me

209
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,978
here on Vashon Island where I live but

210
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:23,519
but it's important to be sure that that

211
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:26,399
I am not a doctor and I am not

212
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:29,339
cosplaying as a doctor at all nor

213
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,258
charging money so not practicing

214
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,778
medicine without a license and I always

215
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,820
encourage you to talk to your doctors

216
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:38,820
about anything that you just decide to

217
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,360
do after listening to shaping fire

218
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,540
that said with this episode I'm trying

219
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,120
to offer this dosing information in a

220
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,980
way so people don't have to reach out to

221
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,500
me all the time so

222
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,659
um please this is not an invitation to

223
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,458
send me Instagram messages and emails

224
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,139
asking me about

225
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,278
um your specific

226
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,620
um ailment

227
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,439
um I'm not really working with patients

228
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,720
anymore except for my local neighbors so

229
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,600
so I hope that you get what you need

230
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,339
from this episode and I tried to make it

231
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,120
as complete as possible just for that

232
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,700
reason

233
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,860
so going forward you can expect more

234
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,440
soil episodes more regenerative

235
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,959
techniques more making hash and oil and

236
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,399
such at home and of course more cannabis

237
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,919
and health and I'm going to keep up with

238
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,419
the mushrooms DMT and other entheogen

239
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,860

host shangolos my guest today is well me

266
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,338
shangolos I have been a cannabis

267
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,660
educator for the last decade and have

268
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,660
been involved with cannabis medicine

269
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:26,519
since 1989. I have listened to the

270
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:28,620
stories of more patients than I can

271
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,720
count I founded the Vashon Island

272
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,060
marijuana Enthusiast Alliance many years

273
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,740
ago to gather cannabis patients and

274
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,359
those who love them to share are best

275
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,700
practices and to bring in international

276
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,899
guest speakers and boy oh boy has that

277
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,240
been a success

278
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,278
I presently spend my time producing the

279
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,100
shaping fire podcast as I recover from

280
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:49,259
burnout and study neurodivergence this

281
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,180
is a long episode but I was careful to

282
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:53,220
edit out anything that felt like filler

283
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,319
My Hope Is that it's a comprehensive

284
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,420
guide for those who are new to dosing

285
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,760
cannabinoids so they can take their next

286
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,199
steps toward healing with confidence

287
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,419
this is the first time I've ever

288
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,579
recorded solo like this so perhaps cut

289
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,620
me some slack if you like this sort of

290
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,359
episode please let me know because I

291
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,060
have an episode like this written on the

292
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,159
90-day cancer protocol too that I do if

293
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,018
you happen to like this format okay

294
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,939
friends let's go

295
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,740
so here we are friends I have been

296
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,300
wanting to record this episode for a

297
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,700
couple years now it's one of the most

298
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:26,879
common things that I'm asked for I I

299
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,560
teach about dosing a lot to uh you know

300
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,778
small groups of people in their homes

301
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,719
and uh you know occasionally I'm asked

302
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:36,360
to do this talk at um you know at

303
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,920
conventions or or you know caregiver

304
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,899
events or whatever

305
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,399
um but those are always so informal and

306
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,659
there's always lots of questions it

307
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,000
never really

308
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:47,159
um seemed appropriate to to put any of

309
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,839
those recordings out so for the first

310
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,078
time here for the 100th episode I

311
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,060
figured I would uh give it a shot to put

312
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,419
this body of information that I've got

313
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:58,979
um here for you so that you can you know

314
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:00,599
potentially learn some yourself and

315
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,240
share it with caregivers and family and

316
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,360
friends in a way that can get Folks up

317
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,539
to speed on cannabis dosing in a way

318
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,000
that is useful to them in their everyday

319
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,980
life and isn't packed with

320
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,980
misinformation because as we all know

321
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,259
most of the information that you can get

322
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,420
um from just searching online is pretty

323
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,519
bad um but I will take a moment and plug

324
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,860
project

325
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,019
cbd.org Martin Lee has done a great job

326
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,639
pulling together

327
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,278
um you know accurate cannabis

328
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,799
information with um excellent articles

329
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:37,799
on different medical conditions and

330
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,439
using cannabis for it and at the end of

331
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,179
all the Articles they have got links to

332
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,579
all of the original cannabis white

333
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,699
papers on that particular canvas medical

334
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:49,859
topic so if I would recommend that you

335
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,660
go anywhere else it would be to project

336
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,300
CBD so

337
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:57,120
this episode is primarily designed for

338
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:59,399
patients and those who love them um you

339
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,799
know I pretty much consider everyone who

340
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,019
uses cannabis to be a you know air

341
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,899
quotes cannabis patient because you know

342
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:09,000
even if you're just using cannabis as uh

343
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:11,039
you know you know recreationally because

344
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,039
it you know makes you feel good and

345
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,599
maybe decreases your anxiety and you

346
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,278
know causes you to have fun when you're

347
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
out in nature or playing video games or

348
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,299
whatever

349
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,778
you're using it to you know as a

350
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:26,338
euphoric to improve your life so that

351
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:28,200
um you know

352
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,000
you have a life that's worth living

353
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,500
right things are hard now for a lot of

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,078
people and a lot of us turn to cannabis

355
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,879
for quality of life and you know and

356
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,278
that's a good thing

357
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,559
um so I want to point out that the

358
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,439
vocabulary I'll be using today is a

359
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,179
Layman's vocabulary primarily

360
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,040
um it's true that I do a lot of teaching

361
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,659
to caregivers and doctors and nurses and

362
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,199
things like that to help them understand

363
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:54,539
how best to you know assess and plan for

364
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,060
and dose cannabis medicine in their

365
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,620
clinics but the vast majority of the

366
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,778
people that I talk to are just like

367
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,259
regular folks you know like somebody's

368
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,919
mom somebody's Uncle somebody's neighbor

369
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,259
um

370
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,759
and and Hell a lot of the times it's

371
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:10,679
just the people that I run into at the

372
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,500
grocery store on the island where I live

373
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:16,078
and so um that's those are the people

374
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,899
that uh you know I I talked to most

375
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:21,599
because I think that's where I can have

376
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,578
um the most authentic uh impact so

377
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,778
um this episode is for those folks for

378
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:26,879
you folks

379
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:30,059
um who are don't don't necessarily have

380
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:33,539
medical training and yet you really want

381
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:35,578
to have a specific dosing information

382
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,679
um for yourself or to help the people

383
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:39,059
that you like so

384
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:43,319
um you know

385
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:45,000
my experience is with Consulting

386
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,519
teaching however you want to put it for

387
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,839
over a thousand patients for almost a

388
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,759
decade now and also as a medicine maker

389
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,260
for myself I've Had a Brain Injury a

390
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,000
couple car accidents things like that

391
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:01,559
and so I've had the opportunity to

392
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,240
participate in the Washington Medical

393
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,939
Market

394
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,980
um and and learn lots of different

395
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,620
feedback from different types of

396
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,720
patients at different ages and you know

397
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,879
economic levels on different types of

398
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,000
products from tincture to flower to

399
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,019
adipose to uh you know

400
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,039
um

401
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,980
no

402
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,958
what we call RSO but I don't prefer that

403
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,120
name I I prefer just a full extract

404
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,039
cannabis oil all that stuff you know and

405
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,360
and after you spend this much time

406
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,278
talking with people and learning

407
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,919
everybody's best practices and then

408
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,778
giving suggestions to people and then

409
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,059
hearing back from them

410
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:42,240
you know I've developed a pretty um good

411
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:45,059
body of information in my head and then

412
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,120
um you know four years ago I put

413
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:51,659
together a study on Vashon on CBD oil

414
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,159
dosing I guess that's five years ago now

415
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,860
um and then three years ago I did the

416
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,198
same thing with a CBG oil

417
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,899
and that brought up a whole bunch of

418
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:03,000
very interesting applications for CBG

419
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,740
and we'll talk about that later and then

420
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,820
um I'm just setting up one right now on

421
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:11,940
cbdv the Varin version of uh cannabidiol

422
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,459
and so um these are opportunities that

423
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,100
really afford me a lot more

424
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:19,739
um first-person information than than

425
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,300
even most clinical doctors so so here we

426
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,698
go during the first set we're going to

427
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:25,740
talk about some Basics about the

428
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:29,099
endocannabinoid system

429
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,799
and different methods of use of cannabis

430
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,860
and their pros and cons specifically for

431
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:37,939
patients and then during the second set

432
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,560
we're going to talk about the specific

433
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,500
cannabinoids that we are most familiar

434
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,919
with and we and we have actual dosing

435
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,078
information for and then to help get

436
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:50,159
your head wrapped around

437
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,258
um

438
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,600
like how to actually apply this stuff

439
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,639
the third set is is all about very

440
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,079
specific medical conditions

441
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,180
um that once we talk about

442
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,879
those medical conditions and how to

443
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:08,578
Think Through the dosing on those you'll

444
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,579
have a really good idea of how to Think

445
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:13,379
Through similar medical conditions and

446
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:15,539
and how to Think Through dosing on those

447
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,459
because my goal with this episode is not

448
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,500
just like give you a spreadsheet in your

449
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,818
head of okay if you've got this take

450
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,519
this if you've got this take this

451
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:25,740
because really every human is different

452
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,939
and in divide individualized medicine is

453
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,400
something that we can attain with

454
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,740
cannabis so so let's do that and so

455
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,220
instead of just giving you very

456
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:38,940
um you know tight dosing specifications

457
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,200
for for assuming everybody's the same I

458
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,160
want to teach you how to think about

459
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,460
cannabis dosing so you can understand

460
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,740
why the dosing is the way it is and and

461
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,840
so you can make subtle changes based on

462
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:56,519
you or your your patients needs and you

463
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:58,259
can be a more Dynamic cannabis user than

464
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,720
um than you would be if you were just

465
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:03,259
you know hearing you know the specific

466
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,200
milligrams you need because honestly

467
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:08,339
people's dosing needs flexibility

468
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
let's start by talking about the

469
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:12,359
endocannabinoid system the

470
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,839
endocannabinoid system is the human

471
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:18,359
body's primary regulatory system it's

472
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,058
kind of like a thermostat for all of the

473
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,159
mission critical systems of the body if

474
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,798
you've got a system that's running hot

475
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,740
it cools it down and if you've got a

476
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:32,639
bodily system that's sluggish it fires

477
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,679
it up and it brings everything back to

478
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,280
the middle a balanced place what they

479
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:40,140
call in Chinese medicine to tonify right

480
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,940
to bring back into balance

481
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,620
and that's what the endocannabinoid

482
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,900
system does

483
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,779
um I think of it and I often explain it

484
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,700
as being a second grade teacher when the

485
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:53,038
second grade teacher is in the classroom

486
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,600
the kids are generally behaving right

487
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,500
they're doing their work and doing their

488
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,000
thing

489
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,558
um but if somebody comes to the door and

490
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,720
the second grade teacher needs to step

491
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,279
out into the hallway for a moment the

492
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,558
kids will be fine for a while but

493
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,660
eventually some kid will you know crack

494
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,460
up or make a noise and then another kid

495
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,960
will crack up and then you know

496
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,700
eventually a bunch of the kids are

497
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,279
cracking up until the second grade

498
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,779
teacher comes back into the room same

499
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,940
thing with your endocannabinoid system

500
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:21,538
when the endocannabinoid system is

501
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,400
thriving and strong it is regulating all

502
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:25,740
of those bodily systems the way that

503
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,700
it's supposed to the challenge comes

504
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:32,279
into when our endocannabinoid system

505
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,679
becomes weakened and different folks

506
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,359
have different systems fall into

507
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,960
dysregulation

508
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:41,579
um that's one of the odd things of why

509
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,620
endocannabinoid deficiency can look so

510
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,960
different because when you have a

511
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,819
weakened endocannabinoid system

512
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,500
you know different people have got

513
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,418
different second grade students that go

514
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,480
bad right so some somebody somebody

515
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:56,220
might um see it in migraines and

516
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,200
somebody else might get it in irritable

517
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,900
bowel syndrome and somebody else might

518
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,100
get fibromyalgia and

519
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,660
um since somebody else might get a

520
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,579
combination of these things and the

521
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,798
longer they ignore it they start to

522
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,980
stack up more and more of these ailments

523
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,839
from the endocannabinoid system no

524
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,360
longer effectively keeping their

525
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,859
different bodily systems in balance and

526
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,779
so that's why it's so important to keep

527
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:22,979
the endocannabinoid system from

528
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,960
beginning becoming deficient some of the

529
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,419
most common first things we see are IBS

530
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,940
fibromyalgia migraines but also

531
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:34,080
autoimmune issues and Parkinson's and

532
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:37,440
dementia these are all ailments that at

533
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:40,439
their core have got an endocannabinoid

534
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,360
um base so let's talk a little bit more

535
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,919
about endocannabinoid deficiency so

536
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:48,558
these are aspects of a dysregulated

537
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,538
endocannabinoid system right when the

538
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,178
endocannabinoid system is not making

539
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,798
enough

540
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:58,400
endogenous cannabinoids which means

541
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:00,779
cannabinoids that are made in the body

542
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,000
it doesn't have enough signaling

543
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:05,940
molecules to go around the body and and

544
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,019
do the work and to regulate these

545
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,740
systems

546
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:13,400
and you know if you if you refer to Dr

547
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,960
Ethan Russo's original paper on

548
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,000
endocannabinoid deficiency and you look

549
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,298
at the causes for endocannabinoid

550
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,279
deficiency it reads just like a normal

551
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:25,440
day in America listen to this these are

552
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,819
these are the five big things so number

553
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,019
one environmental toxins number two

554
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:33,240
Pharmaceuticals that repress the immune

555
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:35,519
system or intentionally disregulate the

556
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,380
human body in some way like chemo being

557
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,240
an extreme example

558
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,919
um but you know antibiotics are another

559
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,380
example so it doesn't it doesn't take

560
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,700
much you're we're just talking about any

561
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,580
pharmaceutical that's going to be

562
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,600
repressing normal endocannabinoid

563
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:50,158
operation

564
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,158
poor sleep

565
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,039
poor nutrition and stress

566
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,500
oh my gosh that's that's just the modern

567
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:01,259
world so

568
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,359
um it is very likely that most if not

569
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:06,000
everybody in the country has got an

570
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,859
endocannabinoid deficiency and that

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,179
explains why we've got

572
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,219
this is you know such a terrible

573
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,259
situation with uh so many people getting

574
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,339
sick in different ways and and having

575
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,658
weakened immune systems which you know

576
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:21,899
cause us to walk around our lives with

577
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:24,539
heightened anxiety and susceptible to

578
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,038
all sorts of uh you know disease and

579
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:28,740
virus

580
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:31,200
so you know when teaching specifically

581
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,960
about CBD cannabis medicine in general

582
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,019
but really about CBD some people become

583
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,319
skeptical asking how can one supplement

584
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:43,139
help so many different ailments but it's

585
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,879
really just one thing that CBD supports

586
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,940
right and that's the endocannabinoid

587
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:52,200
system but that system touches nearly

588
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:55,620
everything in the body so when we add a

589
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,600
cannabidiol CBD as a supplement it just

590
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:00,839
makes sense that if you would strengthen

591
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,000
the body's self-regulation system that

592
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:06,240
you would also empower the body to make

593
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,700
the changes it needs everywhere so this

594
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,200
is why they say oh you got migraines CBD

595
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,840
you got irritable bowel syndrome you got

596
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,179
you know CBD you got poor sleep CBD you

597
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:18,538
got pain CBD it's like ah come on man

598
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:21,120
like it can't be a Panacea but

599
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:24,538
it is and it isn't like it really does

600
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,939
help alleviate all of this suffering but

601
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:28,679
it's really just because it's helping

602
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,659
one system and that system is the

603
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,480
endocannabinoid system and that's the

604
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:36,600
master regulatory system so it's really

605
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,759
just a matter of perspective

606
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,579
um if you want to learn more about this

607
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:45,480
firsthand from Dr Ethan Russo his

608
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:48,839
seminal paper on that from 2004 called

609
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,179
clinical endocannabinoid deficiency is

610
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,000
available easily for free online and if

611
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,880
you go to the shapingfire website for

612
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,298
this episode number 100 I've got a link

613
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,120
to it uh for you there also if you want

614
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:03,960
to hear Dr Ethan Russo talking about

615
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:06,599
endocannabinoid deficiency in medical

616
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,880
cannabis I actually did an interview

617
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:13,740
with him about endocannabinoid

618
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,460
deficiency a long time ago back in 2015.

619
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,599
um when I was still a partner over at

620
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,360
guntrpreneur.com and hosting the

621
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:26,279
entrepreneur.com podcast so if you go

622
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:28,379
over the to godpreneur.com into 2015.

623
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,798
um you can find my interview with Dr

624
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,440
Russo there before I left entrepreneur

625
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:36,720
and started shaping fire

626
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,259
um you can also read a very helpful

627
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,900
article on endocannabinoid nutrition

628
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:44,339
um from 2016.

629
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,340
um actually it's not an article it's

630
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:51,058
another interview I did with Ethan Russo

631
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:53,099
at guntrpreneur again so uh I did a I

632
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:54,899
did a full year of weekly episodes for

633
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:57,058
them like I think I did like 54 episodes

634
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,220
before um

635
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:02,099
before I wish them well and came over

636
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,140
and started shaping fire so so in 2016

637
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:06,480
that episode is called endocannabinoid

638
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,500
nutrition and it's probably really easy

639
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,339
if you just you know Google

640
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:14,339
endocannabinoid nutrition Ethan Russo

641
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:17,038
entrepreneur that'll get you there

642
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:19,199
um also uh more recently though if you

643
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,599
want to learn more about endocannabinoid

644
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,319
mechanics I also recommend shaping fire

645
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:27,058
episodes 78 and 81 and they're both with

646
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:30,058
Dr Miyabi Shields who is an

647
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:32,399
endocannabinoid researcher and we talk

648
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:34,918
in detail about endocannabinoid

649
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,700
mechanics and um you know kind of the

650
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:42,179
endocannabinoid system in depth and um

651
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,580
and Miyabi is uh absolutely a fantastic

652
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:47,400
guest and um

653
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:48,658
a uh pharmacologist and really

654
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,960
understands

655
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:55,140
um you know the the biochemical

656
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,819
um workings of of the human body so all

657
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,500
right so so let's move on to the next

658
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:00,839
section you can always look up more on

659
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,000
the endocannabinoid system but I think

660
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,879
that that is a good enough explanation

661
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,798
for for most folks uh to get a good

662
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,840
picture of it in their head so the next

663
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:13,278
thing we're going to talk about is a

664
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:16,619
method of use right how do you get the

665
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:20,220
cannabinoids into your body and so so

666
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:22,139
how we jump from endocannabinoids to

667
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,558
using the cannabis plant is pretty

668
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,059
simple I mentioned that the

669
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,700
endocannabinoid system creates and

670
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:32,058
manages uh cannabinoids and when they're

671
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,600
made inside the body they're called

672
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:35,819
endocannabinoids because they're

673
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,158
endogenous to the body they're they're

674
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:40,980
germane to the body they they come from

675
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,720
the body but if your body is not making

676
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,860
them because you have endocannabinoid

677
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,600
deficiency

678
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:47,240
you've got to get them elsewhere and

679
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,500
then you've got to put them in your body

680
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,140
to strengthen your endocannabinoid

681
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,000
system and hopefully you'd be able to

682
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,360
decrease those

683
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,798
um those five things that cause

684
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,599
endocannabinoid deficiency right so that

685
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,460
you can start making your own again um

686
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:05,519
in the interim you're gonna you're gonna

687
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,340
supplement with phytocannabinoids which

688
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:11,220
are cannabinoids that come from plants

689
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:13,439
so you know your long-term goal is

690
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,440
actually to take phytocannabinoids from

691
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,659
Cannabis but then also go back and and

692
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,460
fix as best as you can the five things

693
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,840
that cause endocannabinoid deficiency

694
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,058
right the poor sleep all right get

695
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,798
better sleep poor nutrition eat better

696
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:28,440
Food Eat fresher food don't eat as much

697
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,940
processed food environmental toxins well

698
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,919
that's pretty that's a lot that's pretty

699
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,380
difficult if you live in the city but

700
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,259
you know do what you can to decrease

701
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,419
environmental toxins and then decrease

702
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,220
the the you know as much as you can the

703
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,960
Pharmaceuticals in your life that are

704
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,600
screwing up your endocannabinoid system

705
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,620
with which for for many of these

706
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,719
ailments we take Pharmaceuticals for we

707
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:54,778
would be better to take a cannabis

708
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,460
medicine full of phytocannabinoids to

709
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:58,500
strengthen our endocannabinoid system to

710
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,200
let the endocannabinoid system solve

711
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:05,400
these issues for us instead of taking

712
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,840
more radicalized Pharmaceuticals that

713
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,440
often have

714
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:13,319
um unpleasant side effects so

715
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,798
so we want to get phytocannabinoids into

716
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:18,538
our body and and those are in the plant

717
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,759
and so

718
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:22,140
um let's talk about the different ways

719
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,419
that you can

720
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,360
um take

721
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:29,278
um the canvas plant into your body

722
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,019
let's start with the most common way

723
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,839
that people get cannabis into their body

724
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:36,839
which is by smoking it so

725
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,899
um while the most traditional and

726
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:43,859
accepted way to use cannabis dosing from

727
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:47,100
smoking cannabis plants is hard because

728
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:49,199
it's very inexact and often patients

729
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:52,319
don't have proper test results for

730
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,558
whatever they are smoking the inexact

731
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:59,220
part is that you you don't know how much

732
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:02,339
of the flower or a joint or a bowl or a

733
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,440
bong to smoke to get the dosage that

734
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:06,839
you're shooting for if you're if you're

735
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,580
shooting for five or ten milligrams of

736
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:10,379
of THC

737
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:12,538
um you know it's it's a you know it

738
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,700
could just be you know another an extra

739
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:17,038
two Puffs that take you from where you

740
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,259
want to be to actually being more

741
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,359
medicated than you want to be and and

742
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:24,000
you've missed the zone that you want

743
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:26,339
that you want to Target to help you with

744
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,558
your ailment I mean we've all had the

745
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:30,359
experience of of wanting to have a

746
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,700
little puffy puff before we go somewhere

747
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,319
and it ends up coming on a lot stronger

748
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,240
and then we're like oh I guess I can't

749
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,339
leave right now and you have to wait to

750
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,319
come down a bit before you go well you

751
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:42,119
know if if you're in the social time of

752
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,619
your day and you don't have a lot of

753
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,898
pressure on you well that that's that's

754
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:47,519
fine you know you can do that

755
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:48,898
um but if you've gotta like get you know

756
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,960
if you're in a lot of pain and you have

757
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:53,639
to get to work if you are uh if you're

758
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,440
having a lot of suffering and you have

759
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,980
to stay sharp to take care of your kids

760
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,620
you know really Smoking may not be the

761
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,720
way to go because it is so hard to

762
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:05,278
titrate your dosage and know exactly

763
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,579
what you're taking

764
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:11,640
also you know the the the the the most

765
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:14,038
patients don't have test results for the

766
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,538
flower that they're smoking most folks

767
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:17,398
don't get the flour that they grow at

768
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:19,679
home tested

769
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,158
um most folks don't get

770
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,080
um uh analysis testing

771
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,100
um when they buy their weed from their

772
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,839
neighbor

773
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:31,619
and you know if you're if you're

774
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:33,359
shopping at a medical or a licensed you

775
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:36,239
know recreational store

776
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,939
you know they may or may not have the

777
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,859
analysis on hand some states they don't

778
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,659
have to have it there they just you know

779
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,898
need to have it back at the original

780
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:48,419
grower and you can you know email them

781
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:50,278
for it right so the big difference

782
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,140
whether or not it's available in the

783
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:53,940
store or if it just like theoretically

784
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:58,320
exists in the world and you could ask

785
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:01,140
for it also just because you know the

786
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,879
there is a certificate of analysis in

787
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,919
the store and you can look at it that

788
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,020
doesn't necessarily mean those are the

789
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,940
ratios that are in your particular

790
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,259
flower

791
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,940
um you know they're different parts of

792
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,980
the plant will develop different

793
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,200
cannabinoids so the things on the top

794
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,759
that are going to the flowers on the top

795
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,220
that are getting

796
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,158
um longer and more intense Sunshine they

797
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,200
will develop different cannabinoids than

798
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,960
um flour that is you know more in the

799
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,419
interior or on the middle or towards the

800
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,579
low and so different parts of the plant

801
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,580
are are actually going to be different

802
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:37,859
medicine to some degree

803
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:40,139
also smoking cannabis results in

804
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:42,000
cannabinoid conversion

805
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,880
um you know it's it's kind of a myth

806
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,579
that the lab results that you are

807
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,278
getting about your flower is showing

808
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:52,019
what exactly is going into your body

809
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:54,240
when you smoke it

810
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:57,058
um we know from significant research

811
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,259
that when you combust

812
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:01,019
um the the

813
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:05,278
flower the cannabinoids convert to

814
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:08,339
different cannabinoids often and so you

815
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,980
get this you know cannabinoid drift and

816
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:13,439
you would only know what you're actually

817
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,538
getting in your smoke by testing the

818
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,640
smoke which is not something that's

819
00:32:15,538 --> 00:32:21,179
available to nearly anybody the reason

820
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,580
why smoking is you know moves so fast is

821
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,519
because when you inhale the smoke your

822
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:28,859
lungs are very efficient at um at

823
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:32,460
bringing in cannabinoids through the

824
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:34,759
through the lung and it's very quickly

825
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,500
in the blood and then it's very quickly

826
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,980
to your brain and distributed around

827
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,798
your body so it's just the fastest and

828
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,159
so as soon as you smoke you know within

829
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:51,000
the first 10 to 15 minutes you take this

830
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:53,760
fast fast ride up this roller coaster

831
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,278
and then you slowly start to you know

832
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,579
come down over time

833
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:01,319
um whereas uh you know when you are

834
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:03,058
using a different method which we'll

835
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,339
talk about you're not you're not going

836
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:07,259
up really fast you're going up at a

837
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:10,019
measured pace and you're coming down as

838
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:12,419
a measured pace and for repeatable for

839
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:14,759
results and for continuing to be able to

840
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,220
be productive during your day this is

841
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,980
what is called for uh most of the time

842
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,038
for patients rather than smoking so

843
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,319
obviously with the added caveat that um

844
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,058
you know if you I have got a an acute

845
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:30,058
situation as a patient and you need

846
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:34,319
medicine now you know top of mind would

847
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:35,700
be a severe pain patients and some types

848
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,278
of

849
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,860
you know anxiety patients sometimes you

850
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:43,200
need to smoke now and you need the the

851
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:45,898
cannabinoids to hit your bloodstream now

852
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,580
and for those folks certainly um smoking

853
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,500
makes the most sense

854
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:51,658
um but generally speaking for most

855
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,398
ailments that most cannabis patients

856
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:55,679
have smoking will not be your option

857
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:58,619
because it's it's too uncontrolled

858
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,820
so let's talk about cannabis oil so

859
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:05,278
cannabis oil is the concentrated resin

860
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:07,678
that is found in the trichomes on the

861
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:10,619
Cannabis flower this is where the

862
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,139
majority of the medicine lives that that

863
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:15,659
we remove from the plant

864
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:19,139
um there are uh you know a lot of

865
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:21,539
different solvents that you can use to

866
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:24,960
remove cannabis oil from the plant

867
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:27,559
material over the years hydrocarbons

868
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,679
have been very you know pop popular

869
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:33,659
butane propane and um but there's been a

870
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,539
lot of pushback around that because not

871
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:38,878
everybody knows how to purge

872
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:41,519
um those hydrocarbons from the oil

873
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,500
correctly and and some of that can end

874
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,579
up in your human

875
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:50,219
um I much prefer as does many um uh

876
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:53,699
medicine makers to use ethanol because

877
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:56,939
ethanol does a really good job at uh

878
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,259
removing uh the the vital components of

879
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,639
the resin

880
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,180
and

881
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:06,179
um is is quite easy to remove after the

882
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:09,598
fact by just adding a small amount of

883
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:11,159
heat and the alcohol just Vapes off so

884
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,940
um it's it's pretty hard to get into

885
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:17,399
trouble with ethanol and is certainly

886
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,559
what is most called for for home

887
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,539
medicine creation but honestly I've got

888
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:24,059
a lot of respect for licensed companies

889
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:26,460
that use ethanol too because even though

890
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:30,019
it's a it's a little bit more laborious

891
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,579
than um you know hydrocarbons often

892
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:35,099
I think it gives a much better snapshot

893
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:38,339
of of all of the healing potential that

894
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:40,500
is in the resin so

895
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:42,179
um so yeah a lot of people call it RSO

896
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,460
Rick Simpson Oil

897
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:48,118
um you know while Rick Simpson deserves

898
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,619
some respect for popularizing RSO

899
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,460
um you know it's not like he invented it

900
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,858
you know

901
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,280
um he did bring it to a larger audience

902
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:57,299
and for that will ever be grateful

903
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,119
um but you know a lot of his original

904
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,560
recipes you know when we look at now

905
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,599
um you know they're using dangerous

906
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,699
solvents and so

907
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,400
um that was a little sketchy but you

908
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:10,319
know building on what um Rick made

909
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,320
popular

910
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,660
um there are now more modern processes

911
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,019
that for example use ethanol which is

912
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:21,659
the primary solvent used nowadays and so

913
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:25,139
we all still kind of call it RSO because

914
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:27,358
that's what people know it first

915
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,980
um but um it's been a whole bunch of

916
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,460
other names have been tried to be given

917
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,500
to it um another popular one is FICO

918
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,838
full extract cannabis oil unfortunately

919
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,338
FICO sounds like fecal though right I

920
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,699
don't I don't think FICO is ever gonna

921
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:43,559
like catch on fully nationally but full

922
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,719
extract cannabis oil that I mean that

923
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,480
that sounds good

924
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,858
um and uh and and so some companies have

925
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,240
tried to name their process different

926
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:54,239
things but

927
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:57,118
um I'll probably sometimes accidentally

928
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,759
say RSO during this episode episode but

929
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,760
I usually just I just usually call it

930
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,680
full full extract cannabis oil and just

931
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,740
say those words and don't usually use

932
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,719
FICO but um but now you're at least

933
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,858
familiar with the terminology

934
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,858
so

935
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:16,319
um one of the reasons why using a full

936
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:18,539
extract cannabis oil is

937
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,480
um is is probably at the top of the list

938
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:24,139
of what to use as a patient is because

939
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,000
once the oil was made

940
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:28,980
all of the oil is pretty uniform and

941
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,380
homogenized

942
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,139
um it's not like oh this part of the

943
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,519
batch has got these cannabinoids and

944
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:37,159
this part of this batch has got these

945
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,019
other cannabinoids

946
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:40,799
once you have

947
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:44,519
um

948
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,539
soaked the Cannabis in the ethanol and

949
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:50,280
then gone and Vaped off the ethanol the

950
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:52,139
the sticky resin that you're left with

951
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,460
is pretty homogenized and it's all the

952
00:37:52,139 --> 00:38:00,719
same and so when you go ahead and you

953
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:03,599
um send it off to a cannabis lab to have

954
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:06,719
the analytics done you know that those

955
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,000
analytics are representative of all of

956
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,319
the medicine in the batch and you can

957
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,699
compare that to what we were just

958
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,099
talking about about cannabis flowers

959
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:15,838
where

960
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:18,838
the flowers that are at the top middle

961
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:21,119
bottom or interior of the plant will all

962
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:24,119
have slightly different cannabinoid

963
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,400
profiles but by the time it's in oil

964
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,940
because it's all been put you know it's

965
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,338
all been soaked and and

966
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:35,280
Vaped off together your oil is is

967
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:36,960
essentially uniform and that's great and

968
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,760
you know if you happen to live somewhere

969
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,440
where you don't have access to a

970
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,839
cannabis lab

971
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,720
at least you know that when you when you

972
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:48,179
take your first Trials of your oil to

973
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:49,858
see how strong you made it once you've

974
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:51,719
you know you've taken it three or four

975
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:55,799
times and you're like okay I know how

976
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:58,019
much I need as a patient of my stuff

977
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,660
um it's gonna be like that for the rest

978
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:02,280
of the that oil that you take it's not

979
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:04,440
like um you're gonna take the first

980
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,680
couple and you'll be like okay I now

981
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,858
know that I need you know

982
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:12,239
.05 milliliters of this oil for the

983
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:15,299
medicinal experience that I'm looking

984
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,219
for only to like take that same amount

985
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,500
four days later and you're like oh my

986
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:21,179
God I'm so high like that's not what

987
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,639
medicinal cannabis about is about

988
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:26,759
medicinal cannabis is about repeatable

989
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:28,559
results that you can rely on to improve

990
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,079
your health improve the strength of your

991
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,578
endocannabinoid system and allow you to

992
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,820
take cannabinoids while you can still

993
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:39,180
function in life by by you know going to

994
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,400
work or or taking care of your family or

995
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:44,639
I don't know if you're bad enough just

996
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,099
live right so we're looking for

997
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:50,098
repeatable results and that is one great

998
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:51,480
aspect of cannabis oil

999
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,640
another thing that's great about

1000
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,740
cannabis oil is um you know when you're

1001
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:57,118
when you're buying flour

1002
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:00,899
um

1003
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:03,300
flower costs money if it's got any

1004
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:07,380
partic it costs more money if it's got

1005
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:10,740
any sort of bag of Peel right so the the

1006
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,720
least expensive flower to buy is flour

1007
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,659
that is ugly and I don't I don't mean

1008
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:19,019
all molded and and such but I mean like

1009
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:21,118
like mids and lowers and stuff that was

1010
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:24,300
trimmed badly or wasn't trimmed at all

1011
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,660
like this is the best stuff to be making

1012
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,180
cannabis oil out of and it also happens

1013
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,559
to be the cheapest stuff in the market

1014
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:34,379
and so

1015
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:36,539
um it's not it's not uncommon for a a

1016
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,059
home grower to take all of the tops off

1017
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:41,279
their plant and and cure them and either

1018
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:44,759
keep them or sell them and then take all

1019
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,980
of the the lowers and either process it

1020
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,339
themselves or or give it to a loved one

1021
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:54,059
who's a patient to make into cannabis

1022
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:56,578
oil and so you know back in the day you

1023
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:57,900
know we used to call that trash and so

1024
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:01,140
people would always like where'd you

1025
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,900
dump your trash because all of those all

1026
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:06,118
that trim that came off the plant people

1027
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,980
weren't really doing extraction yet and

1028
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,079
so um people were just trying to play

1029
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,539
find places to dump it where no one

1030
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,359
would find it and and bust them back in

1031
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:18,480
the day and then then all of a sudden

1032
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,460
um people started uh blasting BHO in

1033
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,460
their backyards and trim became like

1034
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,559
really valuable and then you know we've

1035
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,539
just evolved from there that we now use

1036
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:29,159
every part of the plan and we're not

1037
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:31,559
going to talk about making cannabis oil

1038
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:36,259
today I just want you to understand that

1039
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:40,440
the advantages of cannabis oil in its um

1040
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:43,140
uh consistency of analytical results

1041
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,780
throughout the batch and the fact that

1042
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:48,719
once you put it in a capsule and take it

1043
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:51,420
your body will process the capsule and

1044
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:54,419
and take the cannabinoids in and then

1045
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,159
you will slowly feel

1046
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,380
um you know the cannabinoids or not feel

1047
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:01,679
them depending on the dose that you you

1048
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:04,079
choose and you'll slowly have an

1049
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:07,139
intensive intensity of cannabinoids and

1050
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,180
it'll slowly go down and that process

1051
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:13,078
usually takes between three to four

1052
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:14,779
hours so a patient who is doing a

1053
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:18,000
cannabis oil protocol

1054
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:20,339
will often take their capsule every

1055
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,900
three to four hours depending on um you

1056
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:23,578
know their needs and and what they can

1057
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,119
afford

1058
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,920
um

1059
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,200
the last thing I want to say about the

1060
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,680
cannabis oil is that um you know because

1061
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:33,358
it's usually offered in syringes like

1062
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,578
oral syringes

1063
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,699
um it's also quite easy to make uh

1064
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:41,519
capsules most folks will pick up

1065
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:44,098
um one milliliter capsules on eBay

1066
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:47,400
excuse me one milliliter syringes oral

1067
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:49,740
syringes on eBay and you make your oil

1068
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,260
at home and you fill your syringes and

1069
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:56,399
then the the the

1070
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:59,160
the nozzle the nipple the nozzle on the

1071
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,880
one milliliter syringe fits really

1072
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:05,460
nicely into a number three size capsule

1073
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,980
and so it makes making your capsules

1074
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,500
really easy and the sides of the

1075
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,358
syringes are marked so you know whether

1076
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,000
or not you're putting in you know 0.05

1077
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:16,858
milliliter or 0.1 of a milliliter which

1078
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,300
is you know usually where most people

1079
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:21,480
are

1080
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,318
um and uh and people can take it by

1081
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,719
their

1082
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,400
um one note if you are going to buy your

1083
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,959
own capsules

1084
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,079
um I recommend that when you buy them

1085
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,940
buy them separated I went years before

1086
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,700
you could before I realized that you

1087
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,800
could buy your capsules separated and so

1088
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,239
I would just buy bags of capsules that

1089
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,060
were that looked like capsules then I'd

1090
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:46,500
have to separate them all by hand before

1091
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:48,059
I filled my um my capsules with the oil

1092
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,280
and I got to tell you when I was first

1093
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:52,199
starting making my capsules after I got

1094
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,540
my dual concussion resulting in a

1095
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,159
traumatic brain injury

1096
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:58,380
um like that was that was like filming

1097
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,118
capsules was mentally a lot of work and

1098
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,740
so I wanted to make the process as slow

1099
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,358
as possible and it would have been

1100
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:06,179
really nice to have known that I could

1101
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,639
have just bought caps that came in two

1102
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:10,799
bags separated so

1103
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,259
um so there's Pro tip for you okay let's

1104
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,700
talk about tincture now so

1105
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,960
um one of the interesting things about

1106
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:19,618
tincture

1107
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,720
is that tincture is at its most

1108
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:22,700
essential cannabis oil that we just

1109
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:26,399
talked about

1110
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:29,399
suspended in ethanol

1111
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,480
um because uh when you make the cannabis

1112
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,480
oil you are using ethanol to extract the

1113
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,559
resin components from the trichomes on

1114
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,619
the flower

1115
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:44,639
with a tincture what you have is the

1116
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:48,000
Cannabis resin suspended in ethanol

1117
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,858
which is what's used to extract it now

1118
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,179
it's certainly true that some people

1119
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:53,880
will add

1120
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:57,059
um you know vegetable glycerin or

1121
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,940
coconut or honey or a lot of other

1122
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:01,920
things to adulterate the oil to make it

1123
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,200
more palatable right because a straight

1124
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,599
ethanol tincture I mean that's got

1125
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:08,159
that's got some bite to it right I

1126
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:10,260
normally tell patients that if they're

1127
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,940
making an ethanol tincture to be

1128
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,619
prepared to just you know take their

1129
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,358
dose and put it in a little bit of water

1130
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:17,280
and then just drink the water because

1131
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:20,219
you know if you're if you're going to be

1132
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,619
using you know food grade ethanol at 190

1133
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:24,779
proof say for example Everclear I mean

1134
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:27,960
Everclear Burns most people's tongues

1135
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,579
right and so um you know just putting it

1136
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,920
putting a little bit of water in a sake

1137
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:34,440
glass or a shot glass

1138
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,720
and then adding your tincture to that

1139
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,119
will make the ethanol a lot more

1140
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:42,358
palatable if you happen to be in

1141
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,700
recovery from alcohol and you're you

1142
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:47,219
know aren't you're not you you have

1143
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:48,598
chosen to not have any alcohol at all in

1144
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:51,059
your life

1145
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:54,000
um what many patients do is that they

1146
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:56,219
will make a hot tea not boiling but just

1147
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,119
like hot tea and then they'll put their

1148
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:01,858
tincture into the hot tea and the tea

1149
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,519
and just like let it sit for a couple

1150
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:08,460
minutes and the hot tea will Vape off

1151
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:10,920
um you know the ethanol aspect of it and

1152
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,139
it will just leave the cannabinoids the

1153
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,318
resin in the tea and then you just drink

1154
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:18,539
your tea and that seems to work for them

1155
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:21,779
um so so one of the things that's great

1156
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:25,559
about tincture is that when you put the

1157
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,359
resin into the ethanol

1158
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:30,838
um once you let it sit for a little bit

1159
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:32,460
it will uh self-homogenize it will

1160
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,639
become ubiquitous

1161
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,780
uh throughout the jar and which means

1162
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,420
that

1163
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,920
um if you if you make your tincture and

1164
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,200
you strain your tincture and then you

1165
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,300
let it sit for you know a day and and

1166
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,338
let it come to

1167
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,780
I don't know I want to say homeostasis

1168
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,279
but I don't think that's right but if

1169
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,319
you want to if you give it time to

1170
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,700
self-homogenize

1171
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:58,559
um uh you can go ahead and and take a

1172
00:46:56,699 --> 00:47:01,500
sample out of it um you know I like

1173
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,440
using a turkey baster take a sample out

1174
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:07,079
of it and and put it in a little one

1175
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,119
ounce bottle and send it off to your

1176
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:10,920
um cannabis lab and you'll know that the

1177
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:15,480
test that test results that come back

1178
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:17,940
apply to the entire jar of tincture that

1179
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,199
you've made and so you know that's the

1180
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,059
same thing I like about cannabis oil

1181
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,618
right that it's added that it's uniform

1182
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:24,420
and it is one of the biggest problems

1183
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:25,980
with smoking flour because that's not

1184
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,260
uniform so

1185
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:31,260
so tincture we like because it's really

1186
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:33,480
easy for anybody to make and um you know

1187
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,520
if you don't add the adulterants and and

1188
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,219
I don't add any adulterants to the stuff

1189
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,800
that I make for myself and um the stuff

1190
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:41,578
that I make for my parents because

1191
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,440
um

1192
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:49,260
you know as we get older it is more

1193
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,780
difficult to shake a bottle of tincture

1194
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,940
and if and if you've got you know

1195
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:57,119
cannabis resin in there maybe a little

1196
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,920
bit of ethanol and some glycerin those

1197
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,400
have all got different weights and they

1198
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,440
will not be uniform in the in the

1199
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,940
tincture bottle and so if you if you you

1200
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,500
know give it the kind of shake that you

1201
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,599
you can imagine you do with a tincture

1202
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,099
bottle like that's not going to

1203
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,559
homogenize it right you're just gonna

1204
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,838
like kind of mix it up a bit

1205
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:20,099
um but that means that if you are taking

1206
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:22,619
a tincture that has got THC in it which

1207
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:24,838
um you know can because can cause

1208
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:26,640
intoxication

1209
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:29,639
um you will not be getting consistent

1210
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:32,159
doses right if if one

1211
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:34,799
um if one squirt of the dropper is

1212
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:38,279
usually going to be five milligrams and

1213
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,440
and your tincture has got you know honey

1214
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,220
or glycerin or something else you're

1215
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,780
gonna get you know you your your dropper

1216
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:48,239
could have anywhere between like you

1217
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,040
know maybe two to eight milligrams of

1218
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,719
THC in it

1219
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:55,199
um and that's a that's a really big

1220
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:59,578
swing for uh most patients especially

1221
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:01,318
new patients and so um so yeah uh and a

1222
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:03,660
lot of the you know a lot of folks can't

1223
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:05,539
they don't have the wrist you know to be

1224
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:08,759
able to to shake it anymore because

1225
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:10,679
they've got arthritis so so you know if

1226
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,520
you're making your own stuff and you're

1227
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:17,279
making a CBD and like the the actual

1228
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:19,500
amount at any particular time doesn't

1229
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,180
matter as much as you making sure you

1230
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,119
take it four times a day and making sure

1231
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:27,539
you get a daily dose well sure you know

1232
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:30,200
you put glycerin or you know Agave or

1233
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:32,940
honey or whatever with your CBD because

1234
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:35,159
having each dose be exactly the same

1235
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:39,358
it's not really as big of a deal with

1236
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:42,480
CBD but with THC it does because if if

1237
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:45,838
you if you go too high

1238
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,579
um you know you may get uh more THC than

1239
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:49,199
you are prepared for that part of your

1240
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,039
day

1241
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,500
another thing that's great about

1242
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:55,318
tincture uh when it's in ethanol is that

1243
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,579
it's shelf stable right and so for a lot

1244
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:58,079
of patients

1245
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:00,180
um you don't have an opportunity to make

1246
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:04,019
tincture all the time you might grow

1247
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:05,159
your few outdoor plants every summer and

1248
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:07,139
then you're going to want to you know

1249
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:09,899
you'll choose to process that in the

1250
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:12,179
tincture and that tincture needs to last

1251
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:15,358
you a whole year and

1252
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:17,639
um you know uh cannabis oil and tincture

1253
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:20,338
in ethanol are both you know quite shelf

1254
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,259
stable if you keep them out of the Sun

1255
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:25,199
and cool

1256
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:28,319
um and cannabis oil specifically does

1257
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:30,539
pretty well in the crisper but if you're

1258
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,279
putting your uh you know you don't have

1259
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:34,199
to do that with the tincture as much

1260
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,359
because of the ethanol you can either

1261
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:39,539
just store it in a mason jar in a dark

1262
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:42,119
closet or um if you if you want to stay

1263
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:43,800
keep strict controls over your use you

1264
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:46,380
can put it into one ounce tincture

1265
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,760
bottles that you can pick up online for

1266
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,800
places from places like

1267
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,720
specialtybottle.com

1268
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,359
um and then just you know

1269
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,578
um fill those bottles for yourself label

1270
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:58,019
them and put them away and for a lot of

1271
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:58,760
people

1272
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:02,159
um

1273
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,660
managing their tincture use that way is

1274
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:07,139
very visual because you know like okay

1275
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:09,899
I've got I've made 30 bottles and this

1276
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:11,818
has got to last me the year and so you

1277
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,160
you can just see them in the box and as

1278
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:17,460
the Box gets lower you've got a really

1279
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:20,818
good visual example of

1280
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:22,260
of how much you've got left and uh and

1281
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:24,058
you know if if you should be getting

1282
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:26,520
nervous and maybe figuring out where to

1283
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:29,059
get some more flour to make some more or

1284
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:31,920
more hopefully you're just

1285
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:33,960
reinforcing the peace of mind that you

1286
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,338
are a self-sufficient cannabis patient

1287
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,079
and and you can take care of yourself

1288
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:38,940
and you've got what you need so that's

1289
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,539
great another thing that's great about

1290
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:45,300
tincture is uh being able to control and

1291
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:46,858
fine-tune your dosing so with the

1292
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,500
cannabis oil that we talked about and

1293
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:53,039
certainly with smoking with cannabis oil

1294
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:56,880
because the oil is concentrated it's

1295
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:58,739
harder to hit low numbers so

1296
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,519
um you know most of the time when I'm

1297
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:05,399
talking to patients if if they if their

1298
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:06,780
need is only for five or ten milligrams

1299
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,980
of

1300
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:12,839
um of THC it makes sense that they are

1301
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,539
going to use a tincture because a

1302
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:17,159
tincture you can you can get it down to

1303
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:21,239
you know number of drops out of the

1304
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:22,980
dropper if you want whereas with oil you

1305
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:25,439
know which is essentially the resin

1306
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,940
without the ethanol that's in the

1307
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,179
tincture

1308
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,920
um you know it's kind of hard to

1309
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:35,299
um extract

1310
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:39,659
resin from a plant that's high in THC

1311
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:42,780
and get your doses dose down to 5 or 10

1312
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:46,558
milligrams you know you might you might

1313
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:49,440
um you know at .05 milliliter which is a

1314
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,660
usually one of the smallest markings on

1315
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,440
a syringe you might already be up to

1316
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:58,078
like 17 milligrams of THC and so

1317
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,019
when it comes to THC

1318
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:04,740
um I'm usually recommending that new

1319
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:06,960
patients to THC focus on tincture but if

1320
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:10,019
you have a very significant ailment and

1321
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,000
your uh your your

1322
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:13,679
tolerance is very high because you're

1323
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,599
taking a whole bunch of THC every day

1324
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,299
well you've probably graduated up to

1325
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:22,500
cannabis oil now that's different if

1326
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,818
we're talking about CBD and CBG where

1327
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,179
um you know if we're gonna if we're

1328
00:53:23,818 --> 00:53:29,460
going to grow a plant that has CBG we we

1329
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:31,799
might use tincture so that we can have

1330
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:34,980
make it last longer but in most cases

1331
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:37,800
you'll probably make an oil

1332
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:40,920
um because and then just make caps with

1333
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,960
you know 0.05 in it

1334
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,358
um because it's just more convenient and

1335
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,818
you don't have to

1336
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:49,920
use keep the the ethanol in the tincture

1337
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:51,960
bottles and you can pre-make a whole

1338
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,539
bunch of capsules because the difference

1339
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:59,338
you know whether or not you take 5 10 or

1340
00:53:54,539 --> 00:54:01,500
20 milligrams of CBG it won't end up in

1341
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:05,219
you potentially getting intoxicated like

1342
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:08,159
it would if you were taking THC so

1343
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:10,439
um you know when I make my CBG caps I'm

1344
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,960
a little more casual about it when I

1345
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,519
make my THC caps I'm very exacting

1346
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,818
because I don't want to accidentally

1347
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:21,539
over medicate myself but if I'm making

1348
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:22,980
CBG caps well you know I might watch TV

1349
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:25,440
while I'm doing it or something right

1350
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,639
because if I squirt a little bit extra

1351
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,519
in

1352
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:31,199
um it's it's it's not really going to be

1353
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:32,818
um you know bad in any way I might be a

1354
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:35,399
little wasteful

1355
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:37,920
um but but it's not gonna make me super

1356
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,139
stoned and so

1357
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,619
um this is one of the reasons why

1358
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:47,940
tinctures are good because

1359
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:52,380
um once you have once you've got test

1360
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:56,338
results and you know how much is in one

1361
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:58,260
um one dropper of your tincture if if

1362
00:54:56,338 --> 00:55:00,480
you want to take a little bit less less

1363
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:03,119
one day or a little bit more another day

1364
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,400
you can totally make those changes on

1365
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,519
the Fly and it gives you you as a

1366
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:10,318
patient a lot of control and and that's

1367
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:13,259
what you know that's what we want

1368
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,699
um some days you might wake up and you

1369
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,559
know you have to go to a doctor's

1370
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:18,719
appointment and so you want to go a

1371
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,519
little bit more conservative on how much

1372
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,618
THC tincture that you take because you

1373
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:24,480
know that you're gonna have to interact

1374
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,579
with people in an hour or something or

1375
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,740
maybe drive there right

1376
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,599
um but but on another day you may have

1377
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:32,098
slept really badly and you are

1378
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:34,140
experiencing

1379
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:35,940
um your ailments significantly and you

1380
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:37,558
don't have anywhere to go and you might

1381
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,818
triple your dosage because you're like

1382
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:40,200
you know all I'm going to be able to do

1383
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:43,199
today is

1384
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:45,239
um sit on the couch and you know try to

1385
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:47,219
try to not be miserable well you know

1386
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:49,558
that gives you that kind of flexibility

1387
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:52,558
if you've already made all of your oil

1388
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:54,059
into capsules well you know unless

1389
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,319
you've made different potency capsules

1390
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:58,680
all your capsules are going to be the

1391
00:55:55,318 --> 00:56:01,920
same strength and so that is a great

1392
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:05,338
reason that um you know tincture

1393
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:08,338
can be a superior choice for patients

1394
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:10,199
so let's talk about Edibles so

1395
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:12,838
um Edibles have got a place but I gotta

1396
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:14,939
admit that I am not the biggest fan of

1397
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:17,099
Edibles except for specific kinds of

1398
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,179
patients and um first I'll talk a little

1399
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:20,400
bit about

1400
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:22,500
um why I tend to recommend cannabis oil

1401
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,358
and tincture over edibles but then we'll

1402
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,639
also talk about why Edibles are the

1403
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:29,960
perfect thing for particular patients so

1404
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:32,279
first of all Edibles are usually

1405
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,818
non-homogenized and

1406
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:39,660
um or or poorly homogenized right which

1407
00:56:35,818 --> 00:56:42,599
means either either at home or at a at a

1408
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:47,519
licensed cannabis Bakery

1409
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:50,640
they are infusing an oil a fat a butter

1410
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:54,000
um with cannabis either the the flour or

1411
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:55,679
an oil or some or an isolate I guess and

1412
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,420
um and they're mixing that into the oil

1413
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:03,299
and then you add that oil to your recipe

1414
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,980
of whatever you're making for for the

1415
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,539
sake of this discussion let's say that

1416
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,619
they're making brownies since that's so

1417
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:10,259
traditional

1418
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:12,599
and so you mix it into your brownies and

1419
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:15,119
then you bake your brownies and and and

1420
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,920
you know most of us who have been you

1421
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,920
know using cannabis for a few decades

1422
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:23,818
we've all had the experience where

1423
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:26,940
you make a batch of brownies and the

1424
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:29,338
first brownie you have is a different

1425
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:31,079
strength than the fifth brownie which is

1426
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:33,599
a different strength than the 10th

1427
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:36,359
brownie right because

1428
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:39,000
it's kind of just luck of the draw where

1429
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:42,000
how much oil ends up at different parts

1430
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,039
of the brownie pan and so you could eat

1431
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,199
one and it could you know you you are

1432
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:48,779
you're like okay I know that if I eat

1433
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:51,239
you know a half a brownie that's about

1434
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:53,519
the right amount and then you go to eat

1435
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:54,899
a different Brownie and that half a

1436
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,420
brownie actually has got a whole lot

1437
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:59,940
more oil on it just

1438
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:02,280
from luck you know from Randomness and

1439
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:04,920
now suddenly you're like you know really

1440
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,480
high and you need to go lay down and

1441
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,099
you're like damn

1442
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,179
um I really thought that all those

1443
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:11,700
brownies were going to be the same

1444
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:13,980
strength and that is very very hard to

1445
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:15,960
do with baked goods

1446
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,719
um especially in the home right like

1447
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:21,059
like this primarily happens when people

1448
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:23,459
share the cookies or whatever that they

1449
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:24,780
make at their house and

1450
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:28,500
um you know they're they're moving along

1451
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:30,780
and they they just mix the brownie mix

1452
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,179
or whatever until it gets the right

1453
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,079
consistency well it being the right

1454
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:39,480
consistency may not be

1455
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,880
also homogenized and suddenly now you're

1456
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,619
making brownies that where each one you

1457
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,640
have is a lottery ticket to being too

1458
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:48,420
stoned

1459
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:51,000
so um uh that is that is one significant

1460
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:53,338
issue with Edibles now now certainly in

1461
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,199
the commercial markets where they are

1462
00:58:53,338 --> 00:58:57,480
increasingly using

1463
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,460
um isolate and they have more control

1464
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,440
over their processes

1465
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:05,099
um you know there are a lot of these 10

1466
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:07,380
milligram uh gummies for example they're

1467
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:09,599
quite you know homogenized

1468
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,480
um you know unless any company that's

1469
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,039
got a worthwhile lab and kitchen is

1470
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,039
doing a pretty good job putting those

1471
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:19,139
together so there's not huge swings

1472
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,480
um but that's not true man you you get a

1473
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:23,279
you get a company that's that's newer or

1474
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,199
have less than less experienced

1475
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,119
employees

1476
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,618
um or you know what's happening as you

1477
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,000
know some states go medical right

1478
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:31,380
because you get all these people who are

1479
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,318
trying to go professional for the first

1480
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:37,079
time and they they made they made

1481
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:39,480
Edibles at home right for their and now

1482
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,920
they're suddenly trying to scale up but

1483
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,358
they haven't learned their lessons and

1484
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,980
best practices yet and so suddenly

1485
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:47,519
you've got a new company and a medical

1486
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:50,818
Market that's putting out Edibles with

1487
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:52,619
wild Swings with their potency

1488
00:59:50,818 --> 00:59:54,420
and you know they'll get complaints and

1489
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:57,358
they'll get best practices and you know

1490
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:59,940
eventually with time they'll be more

1491
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:02,338
consistent but if you're buying from

1492
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:04,980
them at a medical shop you know early on

1493
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:06,599
in your State's process chances are very

1494
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,219
high that you're you're going to get

1495
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:09,539
something that's got a certain level of

1496
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:12,838
risk to it

1497
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:14,818
so that's homogenization also

1498
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:16,920
um for many of the patients that I talk

1499
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:20,279
to they're not in a position to be

1500
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:23,099
taking on these extra sugars and flowers

1501
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,940
and artificial colors and sometimes even

1502
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:29,400
artificial flavorings that Edibles have

1503
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:31,500
especially if you are um you know an

1504
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,019
advanced patient and you need Edibles

1505
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,519
you know four times a day oh my gosh

1506
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:37,380
like let's go back to the brownie

1507
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:40,318
example like like you shouldn't be

1508
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:43,798
having a brownie four times a day or a

1509
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:46,798
cookie or probably a gummy and

1510
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:48,599
um and you know you may decide for you

1511
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,818
that that's okay and that's cool like

1512
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:52,740
we're all our own empowered patients but

1513
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:56,099
I'm talking about General best practices

1514
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:58,379
and generally speaking the Edibles that

1515
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:00,420
are are available you're not going to be

1516
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:02,940
wanting to eat them four times a day or

1517
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,500
maybe even every evening before you go

1518
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,318
to bed right if you're taking it for

1519
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:10,559
insomnia so you got to be really aware

1520
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:13,139
of of the you know what your

1521
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,780
cannabinoids are encapsulated in right

1522
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:18,598
are they are they surrounded by you know

1523
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:21,298
sugars and GMO flowers

1524
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:22,140
um certainly there are really healthy

1525
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:26,400
um

1526
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:29,159
whole plant resin Edibles out there they

1527
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,079
exist but um they they almost always

1528
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:32,879
cost more because they're made with

1529
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:36,059
quality food products

1530
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,680
and um and you know they might not have

1531
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,480
them by you

1532
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:41,039
um

1533
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,139
so the next thing we're going to talk

1534
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:45,358
about is the delayed effect due to

1535
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:47,098
digesting right so

1536
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,019
um in in our first example when we were

1537
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:50,640
talking about smoking at top one of the

1538
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:53,579
great things about smoking is that it

1539
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:56,460
comes on so fast you've got all you know

1540
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:58,380
you're peaking on your cannabinoids in

1541
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:02,159
your in your bloodstream at you know 10

1542
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:04,200
to 15 minutes in that's super fast right

1543
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,239
um Edibles are the opposite right

1544
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:08,759
because uh you're gonna chew it up and

1545
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,858
then you're gonna swallow it and then it

1546
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:14,280
hits your gut and then it goes through

1547
01:02:10,858 --> 01:02:18,480
your liver and then now it's in your um

1548
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:20,880
blood and so it comes on

1549
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,880
um you know most people say between 30

1550
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,920
to 45 minutes but for but everybody

1551
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:29,099
should be aware that sometimes you do

1552
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,079
get a a sneaker edible and it takes a

1553
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:35,220
while for your body to process it maybe

1554
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:37,559
maybe you had a meal earlier and so the

1555
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:39,779
edible is actually behind all the other

1556
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:41,339
food that's got to go through you and so

1557
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:44,880
yeah sometimes it does take two hours

1558
01:02:41,338 --> 01:02:47,460
but you know that's that's that's that's

1559
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,559
pretty rare compared to like 30 to 45

1560
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:53,760
minutes

1561
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:56,040
um and so if you need relief now waiting

1562
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,540
for 45 minutes may not be the right

1563
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,639
solution for you so that's something

1564
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:01,019
you've got to wait for yourself uh and

1565
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:02,639
your own needs

1566
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:06,298
um also one thing that's interesting

1567
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:08,659
about it is that um when THC goes

1568
01:03:06,298 --> 01:03:12,960
through the liver it changes to 11

1569
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:14,639
hydroxy THC in the liver which means

1570
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,380
that you know even though we're you know

1571
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,058
we're talking about cannabis and even

1572
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:21,240
though we're talking about THC it's

1573
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:22,980
really a different form and it um it

1574
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:26,759
feels different it acts differently on

1575
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:30,059
the body and so this is probably

1576
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:32,700
um where the the best benefit of Edibles

1577
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:35,099
comes from because there are certain

1578
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:36,480
patients I would put at the top of the

1579
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:39,660
the list

1580
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,780
um uh uh pain patients rheumatoid

1581
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:43,440
arthritis patients and

1582
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,839
um

1583
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,858
uh pretty much any of the inflammation

1584
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:52,818
uh diseases lots of um uh immune

1585
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:55,980
compromised folks they find that the

1586
01:03:52,818 --> 01:03:59,900
11-hydroxy THC experience that comes

1587
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:04,400
from an edible is far superior to them

1588
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:06,960
than a Delta 9 THC

1589
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,579
preparation and

1590
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,900
um

1591
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:11,339
so you'll have to find this out for

1592
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:16,200
yourself

1593
01:04:11,338 --> 01:04:19,619
um you know 11-hydroxy THC is

1594
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:23,279
not going to be the choice for most

1595
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:24,960
patients but for those that it works

1596
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,380
better for

1597
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,539
um they become very serious about their

1598
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,880
edible consumptions and making sure that

1599
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:35,159
they are finding the edible that they

1600
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:38,280
can make homogenize that is low in sugar

1601
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:41,578
that they can eat the smallest amount of

1602
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,740
edible and get the more profound effect

1603
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:45,119
um and it and it really does become

1604
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:47,399
something that the patients are

1605
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,838
dedicated to so

1606
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,139
um

1607
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:54,179
so yeah sometimes 11-hydroxy THC is the

1608
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:56,338
is the way to go and you'll just have to

1609
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:58,078
if you are that patient you will you

1610
01:04:56,338 --> 01:04:59,099
will come to that realization yourself I

1611
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,839
just want to let you know that it's

1612
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:02,700
there so

1613
01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:07,259
um so that's Edibles right

1614
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:11,639
um a a very common way to take THC

1615
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:13,680
um but also probably not necessarily the

1616
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:16,019
best for most patients if you're going

1617
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:19,019
to be taking it every day because you

1618
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:20,639
can take a tincture or a cannabis oil

1619
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:23,159
um that's not going to have any of those

1620
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,118
extra sugars and flowers and Colors oh

1621
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:25,980
my

1622
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:28,500
okay the last one we're going to talk

1623
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:31,858
about is suppositories and uh you know

1624
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:33,539
suppositories are not used all that much

1625
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:35,578
um because usually

1626
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:37,858
um um you know taking your cannabinoids

1627
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:39,359
orally is going to be appropriate for

1628
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:40,920
just about everybody

1629
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:43,139
um but I have certainly worked with

1630
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:45,298
patients who came to me because they

1631
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:48,598
were having problems of taking their

1632
01:05:45,298 --> 01:05:50,940
cannabis oil orally because they had

1633
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:54,180
something going on that was

1634
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:55,920
um you know chronic and dastardly with

1635
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:58,199
their gut

1636
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,119
um say for example that their their gut

1637
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:04,379
was dysregulated and they were not

1638
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:05,400
creating digestion enzymes properly and

1639
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,260
so

1640
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:11,400
um you know and putting anything into

1641
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:12,839
their gut was a really bad experience or

1642
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,338
potentially

1643
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:17,818
um they have something going on in their

1644
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:20,219
gut so they can't take any fats or Oils

1645
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:22,739
into their gut well you know it's true

1646
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:25,019
that cannabinoids in cannabis oil are

1647
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:28,739
really great for the gut but if the

1648
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:31,259
vehicle is an oily resin from the plant

1649
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:33,838
um you know some patients they can't be

1650
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:36,180
taking any oil into their gut and so or

1651
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:37,798
else you know it causes

1652
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:40,798
um you know lots of grief and suffering

1653
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:42,599
so so that might be a case as well

1654
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:44,519
um I'm sure that there are other ones

1655
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:46,440
that I haven't come across right like

1656
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:49,739
you know potential uh ulcers or

1657
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:52,500
lacerations in the gut that that you

1658
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:53,399
know you might not want to get oil in as

1659
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,920
well

1660
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:58,559
um but for some people they they need to

1661
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:03,119
skip the gut

1662
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:05,579
um also there are some other uh ailments

1663
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,740
that that suppositories are just a great

1664
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:09,420
idea for for example

1665
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:11,219
um for menstrual cramping right for

1666
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:13,380
menstrual cramping you can use a

1667
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:17,098
suppository either in the rectum or in

1668
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:19,920
the vagina and um you will get more

1669
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:22,680
targeted placement of the cannabinoids

1670
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,659
to relieve your symptoms

1671
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:27,960
um if you are going to put cannabis oil

1672
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:30,480
in a vagina be really careful about the

1673
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:33,900
amount you use because you don't want to

1674
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:36,119
throw off the ph and cause other issues

1675
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:40,160
luckily we don't really have the same

1676
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:43,920
kind of pH issues for the rectum

1677
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:46,798
also rectal cancer right if you are you

1678
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,880
know if you are dealing with tumors or

1679
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:51,420
or

1680
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:53,700
such in the rectum of placing the

1681
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:57,240
cannabis oil right there

1682
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:58,980
um is going to increase the level of you

1683
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:01,078
know targeting that you can do for it

1684
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,059
and then also if you've got like you

1685
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,359
know just general hip pains right if

1686
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:07,500
you've got if you've got pains or

1687
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:10,199
discomfort in you know in the area

1688
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,318
between say Your belly button and your

1689
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:15,779
thighs right like that whole area

1690
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:18,119
applying it to the rectum may be a

1691
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:20,039
solution that works for you now granted

1692
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:22,439
most people are going to take it orally

1693
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:24,000
and it can work great but

1694
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:26,579
um you know this is where you decide

1695
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,439
because every patient works out their

1696
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:30,420
own protocol in the end

1697
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:32,879
um you you know you you learn these

1698
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,219
things from people who have done it

1699
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,838
before you like I have but you know you

1700
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:38,880
do this for two weeks and now you're

1701
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:41,278
going to become the expert on your body

1702
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,980
and that's what that's what you know

1703
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,080
good cannabis educators are going to do

1704
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:47,759
is give you all of the options and say

1705
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:50,100
choose what works for you

1706
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:52,679
instead of saying all right I have the

1707
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:55,319
solution for all patients because

1708
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:56,880
um you know each patient is unique just

1709
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:58,679
like growing

1710
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,798
um different types of cannabis are

1711
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:04,259
unique you know uh and uh and we need to

1712
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:04,920
we need to treat each person

1713
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:07,500
um

1714
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,699
in a way that works the best for them

1715
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,140
so

1716
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:12,539
um if if you've decided that

1717
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,739
suppositories are something that um that

1718
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:15,539
might be appropriate for you there's

1719
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:19,039
lots of great kits out there for making

1720
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:21,899
your own at home on for example eBay

1721
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:23,759
they sell these little molds

1722
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:25,559
um that mold them into like a like a

1723
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,479
little suppository like a football you

1724
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,600
know and there's a bunch of different

1725
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:32,759
recipes that you can um that you can use

1726
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,798
some people use shea butter some people

1727
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:38,338
use coconut oil some people use a

1728
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:41,460
combination along with a little bit of a

1729
01:09:38,338 --> 01:09:45,778
full extract cannabis oil and

1730
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:48,838
um you know people find what they like

1731
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:51,420
some people won't use Shay at all

1732
01:09:48,838 --> 01:09:54,000
because they don't care for it some

1733
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:56,520
people will have different uh

1734
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,380
percentages of each right

1735
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,660
um and so what you do is you you would

1736
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:02,880
you would make up you'd fill up these

1737
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:04,679
little molds with whatever you're going

1738
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,880
to put in your suppository and then you

1739
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:07,319
put them in the freezer right and then

1740
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,480
they get hard and then you pop them out

1741
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:11,819
like ice cubes out of an ice cube tray

1742
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:14,519
and um and then

1743
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:16,559
when when it's time to dose you just

1744
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,360
like pop one of those out of the freezer

1745
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,320
and you you put it where you're gonna

1746
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:21,359
put it

1747
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:23,880
and um

1748
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:25,679
um you know it's you might be cold for a

1749
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,140
moment but uh it doesn't last long it's

1750
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,719
not like they're that big and um and

1751
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:33,420
then it melts where you put it and so um

1752
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:35,100
that can be a really great win for um a

1753
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:38,219
lot of folks

1754
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:39,420
um that said it doesn't have to be that

1755
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:41,179
much work

1756
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:43,980
um when I was first learning about

1757
01:10:41,179 --> 01:10:46,619
suppositories and practicing with them

1758
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:48,419
so that um I could um teach it to

1759
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:50,219
Patient groups

1760
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:52,619
um I went through that whole process and

1761
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:54,960
I'm like oh my God this is so much work

1762
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:57,719
and um you know it's so like kind of

1763
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,279
oily and everything on my fingers

1764
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:02,158
um in the end

1765
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:04,460
um you know I realize that you can also

1766
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:06,420
just take a boring

1767
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:09,960
cellulose cap

1768
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:11,760
that that you would use for cannabis oil

1769
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,980
you know up in the canvas oil section

1770
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,500
when we talked about that you can just

1771
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:18,658
put your your cannabis oil in a

1772
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,698
cellulose cap and put that in your

1773
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:22,079
rectum too I don't think I would do that

1774
01:11:20,698 --> 01:11:24,059
vaginally

1775
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:26,460
um I haven't had that experience

1776
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:30,360
um but but um but in your rectum it

1777
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:32,520
works and um you know the the the

1778
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:34,859
fluid or that's in your rectum will

1779
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,600
break down the the cap and and then you

1780
01:11:34,859 --> 01:11:38,939
will you'll you'll get the oil through

1781
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,140
the the rectal rectum wall and that

1782
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:42,178
works

1783
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:44,460
um you know

1784
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:47,158
um but you know most people do recommend

1785
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:50,460
against it just because it's it's kind

1786
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:51,899
of inelegant but um but you know if

1787
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:53,939
you're if you're if you're a serious

1788
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:56,039
cannabis patient and you are already to

1789
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:59,519
the point that you need to be taking

1790
01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:01,380
suppositories you are probably

1791
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:04,020
um doing what you need to do and don't

1792
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:06,420
really care about Elegance anyway

1793
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:08,159
um so by the time you're at that point

1794
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,319
you're doing what you need to do to not

1795
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:12,420
suffer but you know there is there are

1796
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:14,759
the great options because you know there

1797
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:18,420
is nothing as luxurious as a shea butter

1798
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:20,699
and coconut oil suppository but but you

1799
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:23,579
know if you don't have the time for that

1800
01:12:20,698 --> 01:12:26,519
um or or the money for the inputs

1801
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:28,800
um putting it in a a vegan cellulose cap

1802
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,600
works as well

1803
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,460
um all right so that was a great topic

1804
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,760
to end this set on

1805
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:38,158
um so uh so my goal at this point in the

1806
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:41,400
show was for you to have

1807
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:46,559
um a really solid understanding of the

1808
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:48,599
different methods of cannabis intake and

1809
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,940
a good picture for yourself of the

1810
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:54,480
endocannabinoid system why we are taking

1811
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:57,619
cannabis at all so on from this platform

1812
01:12:54,479 --> 01:13:01,198
we will now in the second set

1813
01:12:57,619 --> 01:13:04,738
go into a specific cannabinoids and

1814
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:07,019
understanding the amount of each that we

1815
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:09,779
would want to take to reach different

1816
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:11,760
effects so we're going to go ahead and

1817
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:13,439
take a short break and be right back you

1818
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,320
are listening to the 100th episode of

1819
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,599
shaping fire and I am shangolos without

1820
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:20,579
these advertisers shaping fire would not

1821
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:24,440
happen so please support them and let

1822
01:13:20,579 --> 01:13:24,439
them know you heard them on shapingfire

1823
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,699
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1824
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,619
growing is so valued by Farmers is

1825
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:33,658
because the mycelium networks in the

1826
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:36,179
soil remain established from year to

1827
01:13:33,658 --> 01:13:37,920
year and we know these fungal networks

1828
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:40,260
are essential because they are the

1829
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,480
nutrient super highways that extend far

1830
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:45,060
and wide in the substrate to feed your

1831
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:47,459
plants the trouble with growing in New

1832
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:49,679
Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

1833
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:52,079
is that it takes most of the plant's

1834
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:54,440
life just to create these mycelium

1835
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,519
highways

1836
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:58,738
dynomicoendomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1837
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:01,260

1838
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:03,479
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

1839
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:06,179
and it's three times the concentration

1840
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:09,059

unsustainable resource and the mining of

1934

peat bogs destroys Wetland habitats and

continued to use it now there is finally

pit Moss sounds and acts like peat moss

1942
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:03,900
but instead of being mined from fragile

1943
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:05,939
ecosystems is actually made from

welcome back you are listening to the

01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:18,840
100th episode of shaping fire and I am

1973
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,760
your host shangolos during the first set

1974
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,260
we talked about the endocannabinoid

1975
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,179
system made sure you had a decent

1976
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:25,980
understanding of that and then we talked

1977
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:28,859
about the different methods of getting

1978
01:19:25,979 --> 01:19:31,259
cannabinoids into your body and so

1979
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:33,299
you're starting to get an idea of how

1980
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:36,239
your body functions and the different

1981
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:39,480
ways that we can add the cannabinoids

1982
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:42,599
um to meet your particular needs as a

1983
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:45,178
cannabis patient so now on um set two

1984
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:48,320
what we're going to talk about is the

1985
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:51,658
specific dosing for particular

1986
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:53,579
cannabinoids that are commonly available

1987
01:19:51,658 --> 01:19:55,738
and that we have actually got some

1988
01:19:53,579 --> 01:19:57,059
decent research on so you know I'm not

1989
01:19:55,738 --> 01:19:59,459
going to go through all of the

1990
01:19:57,060 --> 01:20:01,340
cannabinoids that exist because some of

1991
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:05,539
them we barely know anything about yet

1992
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:07,860
however we do know quite a bit about THC

1993
01:20:05,539 --> 01:20:11,039
and CBD

1994
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:13,319
and we know a bit about CBG and so we

1995
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,939
are going to cover those and the idea is

1996
01:20:13,319 --> 01:20:17,698
that you know with those three you can

1997
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:19,019
get well on your way to uh relieving

1998
01:20:17,698 --> 01:20:21,299
your symptoms

1999
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:23,940
and also once you understand how to

2000
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:25,920
think about individual cannabinoids as

2001
01:20:23,939 --> 01:20:27,719
new cannabinoids become popular and the

2002
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,520
research starts to come out

2003
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:31,198
um you'll you'll have a good idea of how

2004
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,540
to Think Through bringing a new

2005
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:35,519
cannabinoid into

2006
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:38,460
um you know your health protocol

2007
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:41,880
so you know we have to start with a

2008
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:42,960
conversation about isolates and whole

2009
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,079
plant

2010
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,279
um resin I would have originally and I

2011
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:50,039
would have in the old days say that

2012
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:52,679
whole plant resin versus isolates

2013
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:56,100
because historically I have not been a

2014
01:20:52,679 --> 01:20:58,020
fan of isolates but over time as the

2015
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:00,600
quality from some Distributors have

2016
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:02,340
increased and

2017
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:05,640
um you know some people don't have

2018
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:07,940
access to certain novel cannabinoids

2019
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:11,460
um it does there is a place for isolates

2020
01:21:07,939 --> 01:21:14,158
in the health program of many cannabis

2021
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:15,800
patients and so I really can't

2022
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:18,658
um justify writing them off anymore

2023
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:20,400
though it's very important to know what

2024
01:21:18,658 --> 01:21:23,460
their good uses are and where their

2025
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:25,139
limitations are so so first of all let's

2026
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:28,439
um let's go back a little bit so

2027
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:31,320
historically people saw it whole plant

2028
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:33,000
cannabinoids simply because it was the

2029
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:35,460
only thing that existed I mean the

2030
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,380
people took the plant and they used the

2031
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:40,399
resin as they got it off the plant

2032
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:43,859
either by smoking the plant or or

2033
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:45,658
mechanically removing the trichomes and

2034
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:48,238
making hash

2035
01:21:45,658 --> 01:21:51,319
um or you know as as solvents were

2036
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:53,639
developed mixing it with ethanol alcohol

2037
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:56,099
so whole plant was like the whole deal

2038
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:58,260
but as technology evolved the creation

2039
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,760
of isolates became possible and

2040
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,800
pharmaceutical companies were very

2041
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,840
interested in isolating these compounds

2042
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,940
so that they could study them for

2043
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:08,279
potential future healing products in the

2044
01:22:05,939 --> 01:22:09,839
future and you know if you're not

2045
01:22:08,279 --> 01:22:13,439
familiar with the term isolate the

2046
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:16,199
isolate just means a single molecule of

2047
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:19,139
the cannabinoids so so one single

2048
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:22,738
molecule of THC or one single molecule

2049
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:26,179
of CBD whereas in a whole plant resin

2050
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:29,099
you're getting a melange of different

2051
01:22:26,179 --> 01:22:31,020
cannabinoids and flavonoids and you know

2052
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:33,600
fats and all these other things that

2053
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:36,120
make for this particular Synergy which

2054
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,820
works so well with the human body

2055
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:41,158
so you know the first time I saw that

2056
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:43,139
there was a really good reason to

2057
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:46,019
consider CBD isil it was in the early

2058
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:48,840
days of CBD before CBD plants were

2059
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:52,080
available just anywhere there was a time

2060
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,000
you know not too long ago let's see

2061
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:57,658
um let's call it like seven or eight

2062
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:01,079
years ago where people started wanting

2063
01:22:57,658 --> 01:23:03,299
CBD but getting your hands on on plants

2064
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:04,859
that were bred with CBD was was pretty

2065
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,360
challenging unless you lived in

2066
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:07,738
California and you know when you were

2067
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:09,238
you were getting them from folks there

2068
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:10,379
who were intentionally trying to spread

2069
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:12,000
them out

2070
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:14,100
and so

2071
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,219
um we got to a point where people wanted

2072
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:19,679
CBD and they especially wanted CBD in

2073
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:21,719
their cannabis oil concentrate but it

2074
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:25,739
just wasn't to be had in any kind of

2075
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:29,039
significant dosage and so uh companies

2076
01:23:25,738 --> 01:23:31,678
started filling that void by extracting

2077
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:33,539
CBD single molecule isolate from the

2078
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:36,960
cannabis plant and selling that

2079
01:23:33,539 --> 01:23:38,698
separately as a powder and you know like

2080
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,219
I said I was pretty uh pretty against

2081
01:23:38,698 --> 01:23:43,379
that at the time as as being an over

2082
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:46,020
processed product

2083
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:48,000
um but after I got over myself and

2084
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:51,540
realized that you know you didn't have

2085
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,158
to take CBD powder alone and and we

2086
01:23:51,539 --> 01:23:57,238
would eventually find out that CBD

2087
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:59,819
powder is helpful for some applications

2088
01:23:57,238 --> 01:24:02,579
that the important thing was

2089
01:23:59,819 --> 01:24:05,759
people should have the understanding

2090
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:09,899
that they can Spike their regular THC

2091
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:12,539
dominant cannabis oil with CBD to expand

2092
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:15,179
the benefits a great deal and I I

2093
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:18,420
remember speaking first with Dr Sunil

2094
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:20,819
Agarwal at the Washington Cannabis

2095
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:23,219
Conference I asked him while he was

2096
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:26,519
speaking whether or not he thought that

2097
01:24:23,219 --> 01:24:29,939
spiking THC dominant cannabis oil with

2098
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:33,300
CBD to make it slightly more whole plant

2099
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:35,698
right since since CBD used to be in land

2100
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:37,500
race plants but we progressively bred it

2101
01:24:35,698 --> 01:24:40,379
out over the years so our cannabis

2102
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:43,079
plants were stronger in THC so you know

2103
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:46,859
a land race a natural plant actually has

2104
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:50,039
a lot more CBD in it than um than the

2105
01:24:46,859 --> 01:24:54,299
bread plants that that are are used for

2106
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:56,039
more recreational use nowadays and he

2107
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:58,560
said yeah he's all like he said that

2108
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:01,079
would make sense to me to him Dr Sunil

2109
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:04,199
Agarwal and he's said that um you know

2110
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:06,899
until until more plants can be evolved

2111
01:25:04,198 --> 01:25:08,579
that have a significant amount of CBD in

2112
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:11,279
them and they can be distributed across

2113
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:15,300
the country if you can get CBD isolate

2114
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:18,840
go ahead and and add that into your Brew

2115
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:22,260
when you are making your um your THC

2116
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:25,500
dominant RSO or cannabis oil and I was

2117
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:27,780
caught off guard but I considered myself

2118
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:30,000
um you know smarter for it and then on

2119
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:31,500
an episode with Dr Ethan Russo about

2120
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,420
five years ago I asked him the same

2121
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:36,179
question he said yeah yeah you know if

2122
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:38,819
you if you need CBD and you can't find

2123
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:41,520
whole plant CBD well go ahead and take

2124
01:25:38,819 --> 01:25:44,039
the isolate and then spike your your

2125
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,080
cannabis oil because your THC Dominic

2126
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:47,760
cannabis oil will have the THC of course

2127
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:50,340
plus it'll have a whole bunch of those

2128
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,800
other you know flavonoids and Canna

2129
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:56,100
Flavin and and novel cannabinoids and

2130
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:59,639
Trace Amounts and then you're adding a

2131
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:02,760
um you know heaping dose of CBD from the

2132
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:05,219
isolate and while everyone agreed that

2133
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,780
that when possible it's always better to

2134
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:08,760
just extract the plant and take the

2135
01:26:06,779 --> 01:26:09,840
plant as is

2136
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,340
um you know we don't live in a perfect

2137
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,840
world and sometimes you need to

2138
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:15,420
sometimes you need to spike your oil

2139
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:17,760
with a cannabinoid you need so

2140
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:20,219
um so another thing that's interesting

2141
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,079
to consider when comparing isolates in a

2142
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:23,460
whole plant is that in the early days of

2143
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:25,319
cannabis research they were doing

2144
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:27,719
cannabis research with the whole plant

2145
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:29,579
resin right and so the early studies

2146
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:31,800
that you can look up when you when you

2147
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:33,479
read what they were using and how they

2148
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,900
actually performed it

2149
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:40,919
um they were extracting a a THC dominant

2150
01:26:36,899 --> 01:26:42,238
resin and experimenting with that but as

2151
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,699
um you know creeping normalization

2152
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:46,859
started and and companies pharmaceutical

2153
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:48,899
companies started

2154
01:26:46,859 --> 01:26:50,039
um uh considering what pharmaceutical

2155
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:52,319
products they were going to make out of

2156
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:54,000
it well suddenly the medical started

2157
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:56,880
study scientific studies started

2158
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,158
focusing more on isolate because you

2159
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:02,159
know the two main advantages of isolate

2160
01:26:59,158 --> 01:27:06,299
are that number one you do isolate the

2161
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:09,960
molecule and so you can be sure

2162
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:12,179
um for repeatability of results because

2163
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:15,060
um you can

2164
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:17,520
you know you can make that isolate

2165
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:20,340
molecule discrete from all the other

2166
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,840
components that are usually in resin and

2167
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:23,400
then second you can't

2168
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,739
um

2169
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:28,619
you can't patent the plant but if they

2170
01:27:25,738 --> 01:27:30,419
made a medicine and they made it out of

2171
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:31,979
isolate and well then they would be able

2172
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:33,779
to patent that and call it a product and

2173
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:37,379
sell it which is how you get products

2174
01:27:33,779 --> 01:27:39,238
like set of X so um so if you look at

2175
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:41,760
the uh if you look at the scientific

2176
01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:45,019
studies now they are much more

2177
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:48,960
dominantly using isolate now

2178
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:50,460
to varying results and and one thing we

2179
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,500
know is generally you need to take a

2180
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:54,539
whole lot more isolate to get the same

2181
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:58,139
kind of results that you normally get

2182
01:27:54,539 --> 01:28:01,380
with a whole plant resin and uh and that

2183
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:03,199
when you take isolate your efficacy goes

2184
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:05,639
up to a point and then it plateaus

2185
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:08,579
whereas when you take whole plant

2186
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:11,400
because of all the synergistic materials

2187
01:28:08,579 --> 01:28:13,559
um generally speaking the more you take

2188
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:16,079
the more reaction you're gonna get it's

2189
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:18,179
worthwhile to know too that whether or

2190
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:20,039
not you want to use isolates or whole

2191
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:22,020
plant often just depends on how much

2192
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:24,300
money you've got there is no question

2193
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:26,400
that isolate is far more affordable than

2194
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:28,380
a whole planned resin you know your

2195
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:30,119
mileage may vary with it but if it's

2196
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:32,039
what you can afford and it happens to

2197
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:34,380
give you benefit well then you know you

2198
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:37,260
should definitely go for it it's really

2199
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:40,500
interesting as the market for cannabis

2200
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:43,619
medicines and other fun products evolve

2201
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:48,179
how odd the the price ratios work so for

2202
01:28:43,619 --> 01:28:51,420
example a whole plant resin is very

2203
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:54,060
expensive compared to isolate single

2204
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:56,340
molecule and so you know you need to

2205
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:59,460
have enough money to be able to afford

2206
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:02,940
the resin and when it comes to CBD resin

2207
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:04,619
most patients their dosages as much as

2208
01:29:02,939 --> 01:29:07,559
they can actually afford because they

2209
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:09,479
always want more and so in this case the

2210
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,239
the resin is very expensive and the

2211
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:15,238
isolate is very inexpensive however in

2212
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:19,678
contrast if you are a cancer patient and

2213
01:29:15,238 --> 01:29:22,079
you are trying to use THC to straight up

2214
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,960
beat the cancer and you're taking a

2215
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:29,100
90-day THC product call versus doing

2216
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:31,980
chemo well suddenly now a THC cannabis

2217
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:34,440
oil is very affordable right because you

2218
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:36,539
know spending fifteen hundred to two

2219
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:40,559
thousand dollars for

2220
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:43,619
um 60 syringes to take over 90 days

2221
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:45,719
um is very affordable versus a round of

2222
01:29:43,619 --> 01:29:48,840
chemo and all the associated costs with

2223
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:50,579
that so you know we can't jump to any

2224
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:52,139
conclusions about this is you know

2225
01:29:50,579 --> 01:29:54,238
cannabis medicine is so expensive or

2226
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:56,520
cannabis medicine is so cheap or don't

2227
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:59,939
use this or don't we really need to

2228
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:02,100
think it through for each patient what

2229
01:29:59,939 --> 01:30:04,379
their unique needs are and what their

2230
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:06,179
financial capabilities are so yet

2231
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,100
another reason why you know we really

2232
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:10,679
don't want to just group cannabis

2233
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:12,179
patients into big buckets and tell them

2234
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:15,359
what's good for everybody because

2235
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:17,279
because each patient is really unique

2236
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:19,799
all right with that discussion of whole

2237
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:22,219
plant resin versus isolates

2238
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:24,600
um past us let's go ahead and talk about

2239
01:30:22,219 --> 01:30:27,000
the first cannabinoid we want to talk

2240
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:29,760
about in detail and that of course is

2241
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,359
the very popular THC and by that I mean

2242
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,980
Delta 9 THC

2243
01:30:32,359 --> 01:30:37,139
tetrahydrocannabinol and so this is the

2244
01:30:34,979 --> 01:30:38,099
one that um you know people have known

2245
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:39,779
about

2246
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,860
um forever and it's the one that if you

2247
01:30:39,779 --> 01:30:42,658
take enough

2248
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:44,158
um you can get intoxicated

2249
01:30:42,658 --> 01:30:46,738
um they're referring to that as a

2250
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:48,179
euphoric but you don't have to take that

2251
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:50,339
much and for most of the things that

2252
01:30:48,179 --> 01:30:53,100
patients need you do not need to take

2253
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:55,619
enough that that you will necessarily

2254
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:59,159
get high but well let's talk about in in

2255
01:30:55,619 --> 01:31:01,198
detail so a THC strongly activates the

2256
01:30:59,158 --> 01:31:03,359
CB1 receptors in the body and the

2257
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:06,839
endocannabinoid system triggering a

2258
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:09,899
feeling of euphoria and this activation

2259
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:12,179
also increases the blood fro blood flow

2260
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:13,920
to the prefrontal cortex in the front of

2261
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:15,899
your brain which is the area that

2262
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,658
controls your ability to focus as well

2263
01:31:15,899 --> 01:31:20,879
as your motor skills and attention and

2264
01:31:18,658 --> 01:31:23,519
memory and like your your ability to

2265
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:25,800
make decisions and then THC also

2266
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,440
interacts with CB2 receptors uh

2267
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:30,179
providing the the analgesic or pain

2268
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:32,579
relieving effect

2269
01:31:30,179 --> 01:31:34,679
um also giving muscle relaxation and

2270
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:36,840
animatic effects which is like helping

2271
01:31:34,679 --> 01:31:39,239
with nausea and vomiting when we're

2272
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:41,100
thinking about THC dosing we have to be

2273
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:43,678
really aware that there are two

2274
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:48,000
different time frames for THC you've got

2275
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:50,960
what can THC help with me today and what

2276
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,600
will THC help me with over over the time

2277
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:56,579
so the short-term effects of THC are

2278
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:59,100
number one it's an analgesic that

2279
01:31:56,579 --> 01:32:01,979
lessens and softens your experience of

2280
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:03,719
the pain it's a distractant and meaning

2281
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:05,459
that you forget about your ailment and

2282
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:07,079
you can focus on other things for a

2283
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:08,579
while like you know working or caring

2284
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:09,539
for the kids or focusing on a fun

2285
01:32:08,579 --> 01:32:11,399
activity

2286
01:32:09,539 --> 01:32:13,500
and um you know when I say it's a

2287
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:15,719
distraction it it kind of just makes you

2288
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:17,158
forget about the thing that you are

2289
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:19,500
suffering from which is why it's

2290
01:32:17,158 --> 01:32:22,259
especially good for PTSD patients right

2291
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:25,079
they can set aside their their memories

2292
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:27,900
of a trauma or of a war zone or a bad

2293
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:31,079
experience and for a moment be

2294
01:32:27,899 --> 01:32:33,238
distracted by the use of the THC which

2295
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:36,658
allows them to do other things that give

2296
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:39,419
their life value and so and honestly

2297
01:32:36,658 --> 01:32:41,460
that's one of the odd additional ways

2298
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,800
that THC is an analgesic because like

2299
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:45,239
not only does it soften your experience

2300
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,579
of the pain and kind of turn down the

2301
01:32:45,238 --> 01:32:50,339
volume but then it distracts you from it

2302
01:32:47,579 --> 01:32:53,399
as well and so THC actually helps with

2303
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:56,520
pain in two different modes it's also an

2304
01:32:53,399 --> 01:32:58,799
anti-inflammatory and so this is used a

2305
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,900
lot by people who are experiencing you

2306
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,779
know rheumatoid arthritis or you know

2307
01:33:00,899 --> 01:33:06,420
just regular arthritis or swelling or

2308
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:09,539
inflammation of the joints uh so in the

2309
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:12,420
in the short term once you take some THC

2310
01:33:09,539 --> 01:33:13,500
those will go down temporarily as part

2311
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,699
of the short-term effects we'll talk

2312
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,979
about that more in the longer term

2313
01:33:14,698 --> 01:33:19,079
effects as mentioned it's also an

2314
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:21,839
animatic meaning that it decreases

2315
01:33:19,079 --> 01:33:24,719
nausea it's a muscle relaxant and which

2316
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:27,119
which decreases spasticity and and if

2317
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:30,300
you're unfamiliar with that that is the

2318
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:32,099
the involuntary clenching of your

2319
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:34,260
muscles that make your body feel all

2320
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:35,579
tight and stuff and and we can apply

2321
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,840
this to lots of different types of

2322
01:33:35,579 --> 01:33:39,779
patients right

2323
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:42,659
um Parkinson's patients uh who have got

2324
01:33:39,779 --> 01:33:45,119
Tremors also Parkinson's patients who

2325
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:48,299
start to get crampy and they start to um

2326
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:49,920
hunch over people who have got pain

2327
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:52,800
pretty much anywhere in their body

2328
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:55,260
because very often the other side of

2329
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:58,320
their body starts to clench in response

2330
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:59,520
to the side that you're trying to keep

2331
01:33:58,319 --> 01:34:01,019
safe right you're trying to keep one

2332
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,000
side of your body

2333
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:04,380
um out of Harm's Way which means that

2334
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,899
your other side of your body is doing

2335
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:10,980
more work and those muscles uh tend to

2336
01:34:06,899 --> 01:34:12,899
get tight and annoyed and then also when

2337
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:14,879
you have muscles that are relaxed it

2338
01:34:12,899 --> 01:34:17,158
decreases your experience of stress I

2339
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:19,319
mean so often with stress we again we

2340
01:34:17,158 --> 01:34:21,899
clench our body and as soon as we're

2341
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:24,420
like ah and you can kind of like open up

2342
01:34:21,899 --> 01:34:27,059
and your muscles feel relaxed um your

2343
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:30,119
anxiety will go down with it and the THC

2344
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:32,340
THC can help with that as well and then

2345
01:34:30,119 --> 01:34:34,500
finally it can help with sleep due to

2346
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:36,300
relaxation because if you're having a

2347
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:38,600
hard time sleeping because you're

2348
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:41,219
stressed out and tight and in your pain

2349
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:43,739
you add some THC and suddenly your

2350
01:34:41,219 --> 01:34:45,239
muscles are relaxed and your pain is

2351
01:34:43,738 --> 01:34:47,759
turned down and you're kind of

2352
01:34:45,238 --> 01:34:50,279
distracted from it and

2353
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,619
um some varieties of THC can cause

2354
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:54,899
drowsiness and lethargy will boom there

2355
01:34:52,619 --> 01:34:57,420
you go it's going to help with with your

2356
01:34:54,899 --> 01:34:59,579
sleep now and that lethargy can be used

2357
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:02,219
for other things too or combined with

2358
01:34:59,579 --> 01:35:05,219
other things so if you were to get a a

2359
01:35:02,219 --> 01:35:07,380
THC plant that also is high in terpenes

2360
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:10,800
like miracine or linole which are both

2361
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:12,779
relaxing you're really setting up a good

2362
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:16,380
combination for somebody who has

2363
01:35:12,779 --> 01:35:18,359
insomnia especially if their insomnia is

2364
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:21,719
compounded by discomfort when they're

2365
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:24,119
trying to go to sleep it's also really

2366
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:26,520
good for people who are who have just

2367
01:35:24,119 --> 01:35:28,559
had surgery because so many of us after

2368
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,760
we've had surgery we're like okay I'm

2369
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,080
feeling better I want to like start

2370
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,699
moving around the house and we're like

2371
01:35:31,079 --> 01:35:34,559
no you're supposed to stay in that bed

2372
01:35:32,698 --> 01:35:36,719
for a week and like I'm supposed to

2373
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,600
bring you food and and people start to

2374
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:42,359
get antsy but if you give them some some

2375
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:46,260
cannabis sting sure well you know they

2376
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:48,658
can they can enjoy that lethargy take

2377
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:50,219
more naps and like you know be more

2378
01:35:48,658 --> 01:35:53,339
easily entertained with like color book

2379
01:35:50,219 --> 01:35:54,779
coloring books and crosswords and word

2380
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:57,659
searches and stuff stuff that just like

2381
01:35:54,779 --> 01:35:59,460
keeps them in bed so their body can heal

2382
01:35:57,658 --> 01:36:01,198
and the last short-term effect of THC

2383
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:04,380
I'm going to hit you here is um as an

2384
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:06,719
appetite stimulant and you know we can

2385
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:09,359
all joke about getting the munchies and

2386
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,739
and sometimes it is very funny and

2387
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:13,380
sometimes it's dangerous because we eat

2388
01:36:10,738 --> 01:36:16,439
all of our food but um but for folks who

2389
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:17,699
actually are having a difficulty eating

2390
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:18,960
um perhaps because they are going

2391
01:36:17,698 --> 01:36:21,000
through

2392
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:23,340
um you know a cancer treatment or some

2393
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,399
other kind of treatment that suppresses

2394
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:27,779
the appetite or they're depressed or or

2395
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:31,319
anything that's going to decrease the

2396
01:36:27,779 --> 01:36:33,619
appetite very often if you use cannabis

2397
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:36,658
well suddenly you're feeling snacky

2398
01:36:33,619 --> 01:36:40,559
because THC interacts with the hunger

2399
01:36:36,658 --> 01:36:42,479
part of the brain and also THC

2400
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:45,480
um makes food taste better and smell

2401
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:47,579
better and so you're more likely to to

2402
01:36:45,479 --> 01:36:49,079
smell or you know smell food being made

2403
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:50,219
in the other room and start to salivate

2404
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:52,800
you're like oh my gosh I'm actually

2405
01:36:50,219 --> 01:36:55,679
hungry and so so those are the

2406
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:57,600
short-term effects of THC so there are

2407
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:59,940
additional benefits for specific and

2408
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,440
elements but this this list gives you a

2409
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:05,219
good understanding of the most commonly

2410
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:07,439
used benefits of THC and and one or more

2411
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:08,760
of these are probably appropriate for

2412
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:10,738
you or the patient that you're working

2413
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:13,739
with so so those are all the things that

2414
01:37:10,738 --> 01:37:15,119
THC will do for you now today as soon as

2415
01:37:13,738 --> 01:37:19,079
you take it

2416
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:21,000
so now when taken over time from once a

2417
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:21,960
day to twice a day or more for a few

2418
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,800
weeks

2419
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:27,899
these daily benefits start to stack up

2420
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:29,820
um one of those reasons is a decrease in

2421
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:33,359
chronic inflammation right if if you're

2422
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:35,519
taking THC and in that moment you're

2423
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:38,819
pushing back the inflammation a little

2424
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:41,699
bit if you continue to do that over time

2425
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:44,279
you will be decreasing your overall

2426
01:37:41,698 --> 01:37:46,379
inflammation not just decreasing it a

2427
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:48,840
little bit for for the next four hours

2428
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:50,819
but if you decrease it now and then you

2429
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:52,560
take THC again in four hours and then

2430
01:37:50,819 --> 01:37:57,299
you take it again in four hours and you

2431
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:59,400
do that tomorrow you can decrease your I

2432
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:02,760
guess standard inflammation that your

2433
01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:05,698
body has which buys you some time to

2434
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:07,800
decrease your discomfort while you are

2435
01:38:05,698 --> 01:38:10,319
trying to figure out what is causing

2436
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:13,800
your inflammation and and decreasing

2437
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:17,340
those and decrease those causes the

2438
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:19,380
second long-term THC benefit that I will

2439
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:21,920
tell you is probably the one that's the

2440
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:26,699
most important and that is apoptosis um

2441
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:29,158
THC kills cancer cells and it's very

2442
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:33,299
interesting to watch it happen in a

2443
01:38:29,158 --> 01:38:36,839
Petri dish a THC molecule come up

2444
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:38,100
against a cancer cell and and burst its

2445
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,020
sidewall

2446
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:43,620
um which I swear has got to be the word

2447
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:46,020
where the term apoptosis comes from and

2448
01:38:43,619 --> 01:38:50,519
um and it kills the cancer cell and so

2449
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:51,960
you know if you just took THC today

2450
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,820
um you know it would kill some cancer

2451
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:56,760
cells and that's great and that's why a

2452
01:38:53,819 --> 01:38:58,619
lot of people use it as a um you know

2453
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,480
some a preventative for cancer because

2454
01:38:58,619 --> 01:39:03,420
if there are any cancer cells in your

2455
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:05,459
body the THC will hopefully mop them up

2456
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:10,440
while they're still small but if you are

2457
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:13,260
taking THC every day your your your

2458
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:15,000
you're killing cancer cells now and then

2459
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:16,739
you're killing more in four hours and

2460
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
then more in four hours and then more in

2461
01:39:16,738 --> 01:39:20,279
four hours and then you sleep and then

2462
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,500
you do it again tomorrow and so as you

2463
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:24,119
start to stack these days

2464
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,219
um next to each other

2465
01:39:24,119 --> 01:39:28,800
um suddenly you are decreasing the size

2466
01:39:26,219 --> 01:39:31,739
of tumors and other forms of cancer and

2467
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,119
and we have seen significant

2468
01:39:31,738 --> 01:39:35,579
um you know both scientific and

2469
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:37,559
anecdotal evidence that this works for a

2470
01:39:35,579 --> 01:39:41,460
great many people on a variety of

2471
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:43,560
cancers and so um you know uh hopefully

2472
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:45,899
there will be another episode like this

2473
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:48,179
where um where I'll be doing it solo and

2474
01:39:45,899 --> 01:39:50,759
I can I can lay out the

2475
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:53,279
um you know the entire application of of

2476
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:55,560
the cancer protocol but for now just

2477
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:56,639
understand that it causes apoptosis and

2478
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:58,800
it's a great thing to take as a

2479
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:01,139
preventative and finally I'm kind of in

2480
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,579
the same category as the as the appetite

2481
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:03,960
stimulant that's a short-term effect

2482
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:05,519
long term

2483
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:08,279
um you can get weight gain from the

2484
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:11,340
appetite and and so for people who have

2485
01:40:08,279 --> 01:40:13,019
got like a wasting disease or or they're

2486
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:15,480
just losing weight long term because

2487
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:17,340
they're depressed well over you know the

2488
01:40:15,479 --> 01:40:19,319
the munchies that you have today and

2489
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:20,760
tomorrow and the third day they start to

2490
01:40:19,319 --> 01:40:22,679
add up and you start putting weight on

2491
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:24,060
and and hopefully start feeling better

2492
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:25,440
so

2493
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:27,060
okay so

2494
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:29,279
um now that we've kind of got an idea of

2495
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:31,739
what the short-term effects are and the

2496
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:33,899
longer term effects of taking uh THC

2497
01:40:31,738 --> 01:40:36,718
generally let's start about talking

2498
01:40:33,899 --> 01:40:38,638
about some real specifics of of the

2499
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,980
amounts the milligrams that we're

2500
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:43,199
talking about when taking THC

2501
01:40:40,979 --> 01:40:47,519
so um the first Benchmark we want to

2502
01:40:43,198 --> 01:40:52,138
look at is a generally a sub-perceptible

2503
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:54,659
dosage of 2.5 milligrams now at 2.5

2504
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:55,980
milligrams you really shouldn't feel it

2505
01:40:54,658 --> 01:40:58,859
at all it would be it would be a

2506
01:40:55,979 --> 01:41:01,979
surprise if your patient felt it now

2507
01:40:58,859 --> 01:41:03,960
they may have anxiety about it and so

2508
01:41:01,979 --> 01:41:07,738
they may think that they're feeling it

2509
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:10,139
um because Placebo is a strong thing but

2510
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:12,119
generally at 2.3 unless unless somebody

2511
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:14,699
is exceptionally sensitive they're not

2512
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:17,059
going to feel it yet so 2.5 is is

2513
01:41:14,698 --> 01:41:20,579
generally pretty safe for most people

2514
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:22,860
who are either scared of the

2515
01:41:20,579 --> 01:41:24,658
intoxication experience or they've got

2516
01:41:22,859 --> 01:41:26,880
control issues and they don't like to

2517
01:41:24,658 --> 01:41:29,219
feel like they are in any way out of

2518
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:32,699
control or perhaps they had a really

2519
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:34,560
negative THC High when they were younger

2520
01:41:32,698 --> 01:41:37,379
and they just never want to feel that

2521
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:39,600
again and yet they need THC for some

2522
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:42,779
reason and so for these people we start

2523
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:46,139
them off at two point five milligrams

2524
01:41:42,779 --> 01:41:50,340
which Honestly though most of us who use

2525
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:52,980
cannabis regularly might scoff at 2.5 if

2526
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:55,079
you're taking 2.5 milligrams of THC

2527
01:41:52,979 --> 01:41:56,698
three to four times a day every three to

2528
01:41:55,079 --> 01:41:59,100
four hours and you're doing that every

2529
01:41:56,698 --> 01:42:02,099
day you are going to see tremendous

2530
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:06,659
results with your arthritis and and

2531
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:09,480
other sorts of inflammatory issues

2532
01:42:06,658 --> 01:42:12,779
um that just need to be addressed every

2533
01:42:09,479 --> 01:42:16,198
day in a small amount and not today in a

2534
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:18,658
large amount so so don't rule out 2.5

2535
01:42:16,198 --> 01:42:20,519
milligrams it can also be used to you

2536
01:42:18,658 --> 01:42:23,460
know create appetite

2537
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:25,080
and uh to a lesser extent but it is true

2538
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:26,520
to give you a little bit of muscle

2539
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:29,039
relaxation for just like physical

2540
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:31,560
comfort so that that would be our first

2541
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:34,198
our first Benchmark is 2.5 milligrams

2542
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:37,199
but but five milligrams is where most

2543
01:42:34,198 --> 01:42:39,359
people start to feel it in some way

2544
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:41,638
um it's often compared to one glass of

2545
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:43,559
wine for most people and this is this

2546
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:46,920
five milligrams is a is the Baseline

2547
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:49,260
dose for most cannabis patients once

2548
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:51,658
patients get comfortable here

2549
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:54,719
um many to most will move up to 10

2550
01:42:51,658 --> 01:42:57,719
milligrams if they also like the feeling

2551
01:42:54,719 --> 01:43:00,060
of it being a slight euphoric right

2552
01:42:57,719 --> 01:43:02,039
because if if the job that you need is

2553
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:04,860
getting done at five milligrams but if

2554
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:07,198
you take 10 milligrams and it's also

2555
01:43:04,859 --> 01:43:09,479
pleasurable well well you know a lot of

2556
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:11,039
people go to that 10 milligram Mark

2557
01:43:09,479 --> 01:43:12,479
pretty quickly

2558
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,219
um just because they're like well if my

2559
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:16,979
medicine can make me feel good like okay

2560
01:43:14,219 --> 01:43:20,340
let's do that you'll find that the

2561
01:43:16,979 --> 01:43:22,738
majority of uh Edibles that are sold in

2562
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:26,579
um medical and licensed recreational

2563
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:31,399
shops are 10 milligrams because it just

2564
01:43:26,579 --> 01:43:34,859
seems to be a a uniform dose that can

2565
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:36,359
help a wide range of people and so

2566
01:43:34,859 --> 01:43:38,759
they'll give you you know whatever it is

2567
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:41,880
uh 10 milligram gummies 10 milligram

2568
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:44,760
cookies 10 milligram gumdrops you know

2569
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:46,618
like whatever they'll likely give you 10

2570
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:48,600
of those to a package so there will be

2571
01:43:46,618 --> 01:43:50,460
10 milligrams each and then there'll be

2572
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:54,300
in a package of 100 milligrams that you

2573
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:57,899
can just take yourself and so

2574
01:43:54,300 --> 01:44:00,779
um at at this at this five to ten area

2575
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:02,339
um you're gonna need to I mean if you

2576
01:44:00,779 --> 01:44:03,479
don't have an experience with cannabis

2577
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:04,920
already

2578
01:44:03,479 --> 01:44:06,779
um

2579
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:09,179
starting with 10 milligrams might

2580
01:44:06,779 --> 01:44:11,519
surprise you and so um this is one of

2581
01:44:09,179 --> 01:44:13,859
the reasons why I recommended

2582
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,719
um tincture earlier in the show because

2583
01:44:13,859 --> 01:44:19,559
if if you have zero experience with

2584
01:44:15,719 --> 01:44:22,020
cannabis starting with 10 milligrams it

2585
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:24,539
might be great but then also it it might

2586
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:26,820
not be for you there's there there is a

2587
01:44:24,539 --> 01:44:28,560
lot of variability in folks and even

2588
01:44:26,819 --> 01:44:31,439
though 10 milligrams sounds low to

2589
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:33,119
people who use cannabis all the time to

2590
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:35,819
somebody who's particularly sensitive

2591
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:39,118
and they've got a lot of CB1 and CB2

2592
01:44:35,819 --> 01:44:42,000
receptors and so their body takes on a

2593
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:43,979
lot of that THC really fast they could

2594
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,260
have an uncomfortable

2595
01:44:43,979 --> 01:44:47,638
um you know dysphoric experience and it

2596
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:50,699
happens all the time

2597
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:53,340
so whenever possible you know um perhaps

2598
01:44:50,698 --> 01:44:56,460
start with a tincture and experiment at

2599
01:44:53,340 --> 01:45:00,300
2.5 and 5 and 10 and kind of find out

2600
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:02,698
what your appropriate dosage is for what

2601
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:04,560
you're trying to take care of

2602
01:45:02,698 --> 01:45:06,658
um and then and then to to understand

2603
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:08,039
what the really high end of the numbers

2604
01:45:06,658 --> 01:45:10,079
look like

2605
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:12,479
um let's let's let's talk about extreme

2606
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:14,939
examples so so if we're talking about

2607
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:17,698
like five or ten milligrams for most

2608
01:45:14,939 --> 01:45:19,799
folks if taken regularly

2609
01:45:17,698 --> 01:45:22,439
um in contrast it's common for cancer

2610
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:26,699
patients seeking to beat the cancer to

2611
01:45:22,439 --> 01:45:29,059
take as much as 750 milligrams of THC of

2612
01:45:26,698 --> 01:45:32,099
whole plant oil extract every day

2613
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:34,800
divided into three servings of 250

2614
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:38,420
milligrams so so we're comparing a

2615
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:41,219
potential 10 milligram THC serving to a

2616
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:43,679
250 milligrams serving three times a day

2617
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:46,560
that's a whole bunch and actually a

2618
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:48,658
devastating amount actually and um you

2619
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,280
know you don't start at that at that

2620
01:45:48,658 --> 01:45:52,920
dosage you know part of the Cannabis

2621
01:45:50,279 --> 01:45:54,300
cancer protocol is that you tight trade

2622
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:56,158
in so you're starting with you know

2623
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:57,840
lower amounts and then over over the

2624
01:45:56,158 --> 01:45:59,759
weeks you increase the amount that

2625
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:02,219
you're taking with the hope that by the

2626
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:05,579
time you're taking 250 milligrams at

2627
01:46:02,219 --> 01:46:08,279
time that you've got some amount of THC

2628
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:10,380
and awareness of what it is to be high

2629
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:11,759
and and you know awareness of what it

2630
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:14,340
means to be

2631
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:16,260
um kind of uncontrollably High there are

2632
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:17,880
certainly people who can handle 250

2633
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:20,039
milligrams

2634
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:22,859
um you know no sweat but the vast

2635
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:27,060
majority of people will be absolutely

2636
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:29,158
blown out at 250 milligrams to the point

2637
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:31,260
that you know they could be questioning

2638
01:46:29,158 --> 01:46:34,500
their sanity right which is which is why

2639
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:36,480
you don't just take 250 milligrams

2640
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:38,639
without knowing what you're doing and in

2641
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:41,519
a cancer protocol why you titrate your

2642
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:43,800
your way in so that you build up over

2643
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:47,760
time it's also important to understand

2644
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:49,800
that the the the maximum dose of THC

2645
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:52,020
that is necessary for a patient is

2646
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:54,600
really their call and even though

2647
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:57,060
somebody might not be taking high levels

2648
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:59,820
of THC intentionally to cause apoptosis

2649
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:03,119
in cancer there are other very unique

2650
01:46:59,819 --> 01:47:07,380
patients who take extraordinary amounts

2651
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:09,179
of of THC you know my my my most

2652
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:11,159
significant example is my buddy Nick

2653
01:47:09,179 --> 01:47:13,618
rised in back in Michigan he's a

2654
01:47:11,158 --> 01:47:15,779
cannabis and dog breeder who also has

2655
01:47:13,618 --> 01:47:18,479
lyme disease and when I first visited

2656
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:21,599
him at his home I was astonished to see

2657
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:23,879
him taking 400 or 500 milligrams of THC

2658
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:26,579
in cannabis oil three to four times a

2659
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:28,618
day and I was just astonished as as he's

2660
01:47:26,579 --> 01:47:31,439
just like you know squirting these

2661
01:47:28,618 --> 01:47:34,019
syringes into his mouth to um to help

2662
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:36,719
quell his seizures and ease his pain and

2663
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:38,520
and and I was I was just astonished

2664
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:40,739
watching it and I was actually afraid

2665
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,900
for him but he's like oh man I do this

2666
01:47:40,738 --> 01:47:45,658
every day this is this is all right and

2667
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:47,698
and so you know this is this is where

2668
01:47:45,658 --> 01:47:49,979
patients start to really have to grow

2669
01:47:47,698 --> 01:47:52,079
their own cannabis because being able to

2670
01:47:49,979 --> 01:47:55,019
afford that much as a patient on the

2671
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:57,539
open market is is um very unrealistic

2672
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:59,520
and so why I always

2673
01:47:57,539 --> 01:48:01,260
um you know stand up for for patients

2674
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,540
having the rights to grow their own and

2675
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:05,159
be self efficient

2676
01:48:03,539 --> 01:48:07,439
so the next thing we're going to talk

2677
01:48:05,158 --> 01:48:09,179
about is you know once you're going over

2678
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:12,299
10 milligrams you're going to learn how

2679
01:48:09,179 --> 01:48:14,460
your particular body responds from THC

2680
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:17,940
and you can move away from dosage

2681
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:20,100
guidelines like this one because all

2682
01:48:17,939 --> 01:48:23,879
it's going to take is is a couple weeks

2683
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:26,280
of you taking THC every day and and you

2684
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:30,600
are going to learn what works for you

2685
01:48:26,279 --> 01:48:32,698
and so guides like this are to help you

2686
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:35,820
understand how to think about cannabis

2687
01:48:32,698 --> 01:48:38,099
dosing but once you're doing it

2688
01:48:35,819 --> 01:48:39,779
you become the expert for your body

2689
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:41,520
because everybody's body really is

2690
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:44,519
different this is why I always recommend

2691
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,780
that people keep a a dosing Journal of

2692
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:49,260
their cannabis use

2693
01:48:45,779 --> 01:48:51,118
because over time you might forget how

2694
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:52,920
much you used to take for this or that

2695
01:48:51,118 --> 01:48:56,039
or or you you might want to look back

2696
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:58,319
and see how you try titrate it in

2697
01:48:56,039 --> 01:49:01,679
um also if if you're gonna bother to

2698
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:04,399
tell your doctor about your THC use as

2699
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:06,960
as part of your overall health solution

2700
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:08,638
doctors like really dig it if you can

2701
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,139
show them that you're taking that you're

2702
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:11,880
you know keeping a journal and that

2703
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:13,380
you're tracking the stuff

2704
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:15,960
um because so many doctors are already

2705
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:18,659
very suspicious of cannabis medicine but

2706
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:22,500
if you can show that you're doing it in

2707
01:49:18,658 --> 01:49:24,420
a controlled air quotes responsible way

2708
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:27,600
um you know they might be more likely to

2709
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:28,980
to you know play with you and and and

2710
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:32,340
not give you

2711
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:35,698
you know a hard time about using it

2712
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:37,860
so um there are two varieties of Black

2713
01:49:35,698 --> 01:49:41,158
Swan patients that we need to talk about

2714
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:43,618
before we end this um this discussion of

2715
01:49:41,158 --> 01:49:45,118
THC specifically

2716
01:49:43,618 --> 01:49:46,380
um the first one

2717
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:48,059
um we're going to talk about our rapid

2718
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:50,000
metabolizers

2719
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:53,280
um there's a variety of human that just

2720
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,260
metabolizes everything super fast

2721
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:59,039
and I have worked with these patients

2722
01:49:55,260 --> 01:50:03,239
and they metabolize THC so fast and and

2723
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:04,920
often mushrooms and LS LSD and

2724
01:50:03,238 --> 01:50:07,678
um you know anything you give them they

2725
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:10,500
they metabolize it super fast to get

2726
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:12,600
almost no effect and

2727
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:14,819
um we have to know that these folks

2728
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:16,139
exist I I worked with this one patient

2729
01:50:14,819 --> 01:50:19,319
who

2730
01:50:16,139 --> 01:50:21,719
um had no experience with cannabis prior

2731
01:50:19,319 --> 01:50:23,939
and then they decided that they um you

2732
01:50:21,719 --> 01:50:26,399
know needed to take it for their health

2733
01:50:23,939 --> 01:50:29,158
and so they started with you know the

2734
01:50:26,399 --> 01:50:31,079
you know the 2.5 5 milligram 10

2735
01:50:29,158 --> 01:50:33,599
milligram and like didn't feel anything

2736
01:50:31,079 --> 01:50:36,300
and so then moved up to 40 and didn't

2737
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:37,500
feel anything and and they found that

2738
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:40,739
their

2739
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:44,579
um uh efficacious dose was actually

2740
01:50:40,738 --> 01:50:46,500
um 80 milligrams of THC at a time and

2741
01:50:44,579 --> 01:50:48,300
and this patient was still like doing

2742
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:50,639
stuff around the house and being

2743
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:54,900
productive and it's it's it's actually

2744
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:57,000
what they needed to take care of their

2745
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:58,859
um their ailment and function like a

2746
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,560
normal human but if you told me that

2747
01:50:58,859 --> 01:51:03,238
somebody who had only been taking THC

2748
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:06,239
for two weeks was already at 80

2749
01:51:03,238 --> 01:51:07,678
milligrams I would fear for them you

2750
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:10,138
know that they that that they were

2751
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,760
taking so much that um you know if they

2752
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:13,739
took that 80 milligram amount that they

2753
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,300
would have a very bad day

2754
01:51:13,738 --> 01:51:17,339
um and yet this this patient just like

2755
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:19,020
worked titrated themselves up over the

2756
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:22,319
course of four or five days and now they

2757
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:25,080
sit at 80 milligrams and you know that

2758
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:27,658
kind of rapid metabolizer is very rare

2759
01:51:25,079 --> 01:51:29,760
but if you are a caregiver you know it's

2760
01:51:27,658 --> 01:51:32,638
also important that you know that it

2761
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:35,639
exists and if you are a patient

2762
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:38,400
um now you have keywords to um to search

2763
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:40,980
so that you can show your caregivers

2764
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:42,960
that yes you you you may require this

2765
01:51:40,979 --> 01:51:43,678
much THC

2766
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,079
um

2767
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,760
the second variety of Black Swan is that

2768
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:49,920
it's estimated that about one in ten

2769
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:54,119
thousand patients are wildly sensitive

2770
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:56,940
to THC the point where you know only a a

2771
01:51:54,118 --> 01:52:00,420
gram or two or excuse me a milligram or

2772
01:51:56,939 --> 01:52:03,359
two is uh going to give them a very bad

2773
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:06,118
experience and I've only seen this once

2774
01:52:03,359 --> 01:52:08,579
um uh a patient reached out to me during

2775
01:52:06,118 --> 01:52:12,179
their very bad experience they they took

2776
01:52:08,579 --> 01:52:15,179
a um a five milligram tincture that they

2777
01:52:12,179 --> 01:52:18,719
got at the licensed store and they

2778
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:21,719
experienced dysphoria hallucinations and

2779
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:24,179
and like intense energy for 12 hours

2780
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:26,520
from such a small dose

2781
01:52:24,179 --> 01:52:29,100
and honestly I wouldn't have believed it

2782
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:30,900
if I hadn't first if I hadn't seen it

2783
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:32,820
firsthand and I was familiar with that

2784
01:52:30,899 --> 01:52:34,679
product and knew that

2785
01:52:32,819 --> 01:52:37,559
um that analytics on it were likely

2786
01:52:34,679 --> 01:52:40,139
right and and that that dose is so small

2787
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:43,800
and and should have such an incredibly

2788
01:52:40,139 --> 01:52:46,800
small effect but I I saw it happen and

2789
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:48,719
so um we do need to be aware that on the

2790
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:51,480
rare occasion you can give a very small

2791
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:52,399
dose to a patient and they will have an

2792
01:52:51,479 --> 01:52:55,859
outside

2793
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:58,019
outsized response to it and they're

2794
01:52:55,859 --> 01:53:00,179
going to need some support in you know

2795
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:02,280
just trying to stay calm and feel okay

2796
01:53:00,179 --> 01:53:04,139
until it wears off like towards the end

2797
01:53:02,279 --> 01:53:05,340
of the day so

2798
01:53:04,139 --> 01:53:06,739
um you know I hope for you that you

2799
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:10,679
don't come across either Rapid

2800
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:12,839
metabolizers or or hyper sensitive Folks

2801
01:53:10,679 --> 01:53:15,300
at THC because

2802
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:17,520
um it's always a real surprise and and

2803
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:19,020
as a caregiver

2804
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:20,100
um you know you feel so bad for him you

2805
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,900
know because they're they're they're

2806
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:24,000
they're they're trying to do their best

2807
01:53:21,899 --> 01:53:26,339
with cannabis medicine and now they're

2808
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:28,979
like like blown out and they've had a

2809
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:30,659
really bad experience and

2810
01:53:28,979 --> 01:53:32,759
um and now they now they really hate

2811
01:53:30,658 --> 01:53:35,579
cannabis medicine so

2812
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:37,739
um so I I hope that um I hope that you

2813
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:39,960
aren't one and I hope that you don't you

2814
01:53:37,738 --> 01:53:42,419
know come across them in your work all

2815
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:44,340
right so let's move on to CBD now you

2816
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:46,560
probably have got a pretty good idea how

2817
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:49,380
to work with THC at this point hopefully

2818
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:51,840
so so CBD

2819
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:55,440
um which stands for cannabid Aisle it

2820
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:59,100
activates the CB1 and CB2 receptors but

2821
01:53:55,439 --> 01:54:01,618
to a much lesser extent than THC does it

2822
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:03,480
doesn't cause intoxication but it's it's

2823
01:54:01,618 --> 01:54:06,539
certainly psychoactive you know a lot of

2824
01:54:03,479 --> 01:54:09,118
people say oh it's not psychoactive but

2825
01:54:06,539 --> 01:54:11,639
um while it won't get you high like THC

2826
01:54:09,118 --> 01:54:13,559
will it is definitely certainly

2827
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:16,139
psychoactive in the sense that it can

2828
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:19,560
change perceptions by bettering your

2829
01:54:16,139 --> 01:54:22,079
mood how CBD exerts its therapeutic

2830
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:25,159
impact on a molecular level is still

2831
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:27,600
being sorted out can I have a dial is a

2832
01:54:25,158 --> 01:54:30,420
pleiotropic drug which I don't usually

2833
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:32,159
have much much opportunity to say in

2834
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:34,618
that it produces many effects through

2835
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:36,238
multiple molecular Pathways the

2836
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:39,719
scientific literature has identified

2837
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:42,118
more than 65 molecular targets of CBD

2838
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:45,179
and the study of these Pathways has

2839
01:54:42,118 --> 01:54:48,658
always only just begun so while we do

2840
01:54:45,179 --> 01:54:51,840
talk about CBD interacting somewhat with

2841
01:54:48,658 --> 01:54:53,339
the CB1 and CB2 receptors it isn't that

2842
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:55,980
the old dose don't interact with

2843
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:59,340
receptors they interact with a lot of

2844
01:54:55,979 --> 01:55:01,439
things and we're just now trying to you

2845
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:04,260
know figure out what those what those

2846
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:06,138
other types of of receptors might be

2847
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:09,300
what those might look like

2848
01:55:06,139 --> 01:55:11,960
CBD is a very active signaling molecule

2849
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:14,460
and it's one of the most useful

2850
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:18,420
cannabinoids for the endocannabinoid

2851
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:21,960
system because of this variety of 65

2852
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:24,239
plus targets it does a lot uh to support

2853
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:25,980
the endocannabinoid system and it feels

2854
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:28,198
very much like a utility player like

2855
01:55:25,979 --> 01:55:29,279
whatever's needed you know come you know

2856
01:55:28,198 --> 01:55:30,799
fill in

2857
01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:33,359
you know

2858
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:36,779
phytocannabinoid version of CBD to

2859
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:39,479
replace endocannabinoids and so it's um

2860
01:55:36,779 --> 01:55:42,960
it's definitely a Workhorse similar to

2861
01:55:39,479 --> 01:55:46,319
THC CBD has benefits now and benefits

2862
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:49,679
later for certain THC is more of a help

2863
01:55:46,319 --> 01:55:51,658
me today cannabinoid and CBD is a bit

2864
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:54,658
more of a help me tomorrow cannabinoid

2865
01:55:51,658 --> 01:55:56,399
because for most of its applications it

2866
01:55:54,658 --> 01:55:59,219
takes time to strengthen the

2867
01:55:56,399 --> 01:56:02,039
endocannabinoid system but it's true

2868
01:55:59,219 --> 01:56:03,779
that cbd2 has some today benefits so so

2869
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:05,279
let's let's talk about short-term and

2870
01:56:03,779 --> 01:56:06,359
long-term benefits just like we did with

2871
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:09,960
THC

2872
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:12,319
so shorter term benefits of CBD

2873
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:16,579
number one the most low hanging fruit

2874
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:18,960
brain chemistry mood anxiety and stress

2875
01:56:16,579 --> 01:56:21,059
this is of all the things that I tell

2876
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:24,179
people you know you need to give CBD

2877
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:26,159
some time to do its job when it comes to

2878
01:56:24,179 --> 01:56:28,139
mood anxiety and stress this is

2879
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:29,519
something that it can help you

2880
01:56:28,139 --> 01:56:31,679
um you know like within an hour

2881
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:34,760
depending on dose and your receptibility

2882
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:37,699
to it then the reason is is because

2883
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:42,420
cannabidiol stimulates the

2884
01:56:37,698 --> 01:56:44,399
5-ht1a serotonin receptor and so you

2885
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:45,679
take it and it goes and it activates it

2886
01:56:44,399 --> 01:56:48,599
and

2887
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:51,840
your mood your brain chemistry will

2888
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:54,600
start to even out as we talked at the

2889
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,579
top of the show in the first set the the

2890
01:56:54,600 --> 01:57:00,179
main goal of the endocannabinoid system

2891
01:56:56,579 --> 01:57:02,579
is to balance

2892
01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:04,500
um the body's other systems and that is

2893
01:57:02,579 --> 01:57:06,960
what's what's happening in this effect

2894
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:09,359
if if your Chemistry has swung one way

2895
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:11,579
or another causing you to be either be

2896
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:13,859
you know depressed or anxious

2897
01:57:11,579 --> 01:57:17,099
um CBD will help bring you back to the

2898
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:19,198
balance place where you can be your best

2899
01:57:17,099 --> 01:57:22,560
um it is also an anti-memetic an

2900
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:24,299
anti-nausea like THC is and when you use

2901
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,460
them together they work together to be

2902
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:29,940
even more effective

2903
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:33,719
and then CBD binds to they're called

2904
01:57:29,939 --> 01:57:37,079
trip V1 receptors a trpv1 receptors

2905
01:57:33,719 --> 01:57:39,359
which also function as ion channels and

2906
01:57:37,079 --> 01:57:41,340
so these trivia ones are known to

2907
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:43,618
mediate pain

2908
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:45,420
um and inflammation and body temperature

2909
01:57:43,618 --> 01:57:49,979
but the main thing that people are

2910
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:52,500
looking to it for is to mediate pain so

2911
01:57:49,979 --> 01:57:54,178
um CBD of course is handling the

2912
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:57,000
experience of pain very differently than

2913
01:57:54,179 --> 01:57:59,340
THC does and so when people put cannabis

2914
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,719
all in one bucket on how it helps with

2915
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:01,980
pain

2916
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:03,359
um you know that they don't really

2917
01:58:01,979 --> 01:58:06,539
understand the medicine very well

2918
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:08,939
because THC as we've already learned it

2919
01:58:06,539 --> 01:58:13,198
helps by being a natural analgesic and

2920
01:58:08,939 --> 01:58:15,719
decreasing the the muscle contraction as

2921
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:18,138
well as being a distraction right well

2922
01:58:15,719 --> 01:58:22,980
CBD in its own way

2923
01:58:18,139 --> 01:58:25,020
it activates the trip V1 which mediates

2924
01:58:22,979 --> 01:58:27,718
the pain perception so it kind of just

2925
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:30,060
like turns down the volume of your

2926
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:32,880
experience of it so when you again when

2927
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:37,980
you have CBD and THC together they work

2928
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:40,679
really well at decreasing pain today

2929
01:58:37,979 --> 01:58:42,539
so the longer term benefits of CBD are

2930
01:58:40,679 --> 01:58:44,579
usually what people are going for very

2931
01:58:42,539 --> 01:58:48,840
often the short-term benefits people are

2932
01:58:44,579 --> 01:58:50,698
looking to THC for help and and they may

2933
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:53,119
have heard CBD helps but but

2934
01:58:50,698 --> 01:58:56,759
realistically cbd's

2935
01:58:53,118 --> 01:59:00,059
most effective role is to strengthen the

2936
01:58:56,760 --> 01:59:02,520
endocannabinoid system so it can do its

2937
01:59:00,060 --> 01:59:04,920
job right and so the longer term

2938
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:07,320
benefits of CBD would be number one

2939
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:10,920
first and foremost to strengthen the

2940
01:59:07,319 --> 01:59:13,618
endocannabinoid system so it can do its

2941
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:16,920
job in rebalancing the various bodies

2942
01:59:13,618 --> 01:59:19,079
systems and the body can heal itself it

2943
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:23,359
just needs some more signaling molecules

2944
01:59:19,079 --> 01:59:26,179
and CBD because it targets these 65

2945
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:29,519
different receptors

2946
01:59:26,179 --> 01:59:31,920
it has a little bit of help for all the

2947
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:33,840
different systems and so it is a great

2948
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:36,779
thing to supplement yourself with every

2949
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:38,699
day to strengthen your body's ability to

2950
01:59:36,779 --> 01:59:42,359
take care of itself

2951
01:59:38,698 --> 01:59:45,118
CBD also exerts an anti-cancer effect as

2952
01:59:42,359 --> 01:59:47,579
well and I won't get too much into the

2953
01:59:45,118 --> 01:59:50,639
mechanics of it but but what it does is

2954
01:59:47,579 --> 01:59:52,139
it it has an anti-proliferative effect

2955
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:54,960
which means

2956
01:59:52,139 --> 01:59:58,139
um it slows down Cancer's ability to

2957
01:59:54,960 --> 02:00:01,980
replicate itself and again if you're

2958
01:59:58,139 --> 02:00:06,659
taking it every day over time you would

2959
02:00:01,979 --> 02:00:08,819
have uh the CBD slowing the increase in

2960
02:00:06,658 --> 02:00:11,158
number of the cancer cells and then

2961
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:12,719
you'd also have THC coming in and

2962
02:00:11,158 --> 02:00:15,899
bursting those cells so they're a very

2963
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:18,599
good team in this regard also another

2964
02:00:15,899 --> 02:00:21,539
great thing is that CBD tends to kick

2965
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:24,900
off the body's housekeeping mechanisms

2966
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:27,359
and so it is helping take care of of

2967
02:00:24,899 --> 02:00:31,138
things that if if allowed to go

2968
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:33,719
neglected over a long term can get

2969
02:00:31,139 --> 02:00:37,159
especially worse so for example

2970
02:00:33,719 --> 02:00:41,579
um when you take CBD

2971
02:00:37,158 --> 02:00:44,939
it activates the ppar gamma which

2972
02:00:41,579 --> 02:00:48,840
degrades the amyloid beta plaque in the

2973
02:00:44,939 --> 02:00:50,460
brain and when this plaque builds up it

2974
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:53,819
is linked to the development of

2975
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:57,719
Alzheimer's disease and so when you are

2976
02:00:53,819 --> 02:01:00,479
taking CBD as a prophylactic like daily

2977
02:00:57,719 --> 02:01:04,800
just so things don't get bad or worse

2978
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:06,259
for you you are actually staving off a a

2979
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:09,300
certain amount of potential of

2980
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:11,460
Alzheimer's in the future we've also

2981
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:14,039
seen patients that have like they're

2982
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:16,800
starting to have dementia and then they

2983
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:20,698
start with a pretty heavy daily use of

2984
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:21,500
CBD and their dementia tends to calm

2985
02:01:20,698 --> 02:01:24,979
down

2986
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:27,679
both probably because of this

2987
02:01:24,979 --> 02:01:32,039
ppar gamma activation

2988
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:34,739
but also because CBD causes neurogenesis

2989
02:01:32,039 --> 02:01:35,779
the creation of new brain cells new

2990
02:01:34,738 --> 02:01:38,579
neurons

2991
02:01:35,779 --> 02:01:41,698
especially the ones that are dope

2992
02:01:38,579 --> 02:01:46,439
dopamine excreting and these dopamine

2993
02:01:41,698 --> 02:01:49,319
excreting neurons help Stave off things

2994
02:01:46,439 --> 02:01:53,698
like Parkinson's and so it really is

2995
02:01:49,319 --> 02:01:56,399
helpful to use CBD on a daily basis

2996
02:01:53,698 --> 02:01:58,019
um you know probably for everybody since

2997
02:01:56,399 --> 02:01:59,879
we know that just about everybody is

2998
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:02,219
suffering from endocannabinoid

2999
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:05,779
deficiency but especially as you're

3000
02:02:02,219 --> 02:02:08,460
getting older and

3001
02:02:05,779 --> 02:02:09,779
your body isn't working as well as it

3002
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:11,158
used to and you're starting to forget

3003
02:02:09,779 --> 02:02:13,679
things and you're starting to be more

3004
02:02:11,158 --> 02:02:16,319
aware of a potential Dementia or

3005
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:18,719
Parkinson's in your future like like you

3006
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:20,399
don't want to go too long without

3007
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,380
supplementing your endocannabinoid

3008
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:25,219
system so it can do the business of

3009
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:25,219
keeping you healthy

3010
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:29,639
now if you really want to dive into

3011
02:02:27,479 --> 02:02:32,698
understanding CBD the only place I

3012
02:02:29,639 --> 02:02:35,099
recommend is project cbd.org that I

3013
02:02:32,698 --> 02:02:36,719
mentioned at the top of the show founder

3014
02:02:35,099 --> 02:02:39,599
Martin Lee has put together an

3015
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:42,060
exceptional cannabis resource for

3016
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:44,460
patients and it's the only online source

3017
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:46,560
that I fully trust so the articles are

3018
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:48,960
written in layman's terms and then they

3019
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:52,440
also provide direct links to the

3020
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:54,658
original scientific papers so so don't

3021
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:56,098
forget project CBD it is it is a great

3022
02:02:54,658 --> 02:02:57,839
and as far as I'm concerned the only

3023
02:02:56,099 --> 02:03:00,599
place to go online

3024
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:04,860
so there's a great deal of confusion and

3025
02:03:00,599 --> 02:03:08,279
debate about the proper dosing of CBD so

3026
02:03:04,859 --> 02:03:10,500
when using whole plant we can offer CBD

3027
02:03:08,279 --> 02:03:12,719
milligram suggestions but the other

3028
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:15,779
cannabinoids in the resin will always

3029
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:18,899
play an uncontrolled role because we

3030
02:03:15,779 --> 02:03:21,359
don't know how CBD might interact with

3031
02:03:18,899 --> 02:03:22,638
the canaflavin that is also in the resin

3032
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:25,799
and what they might be doing

3033
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:29,279
synergistically together so CBD in a

3034
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:32,279
whole resin goes further than just a CBD

3035
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:33,899
isolate because it's got its Partners in

3036
02:03:32,279 --> 02:03:36,179
the resin all the other components of

3037
02:03:33,899 --> 02:03:38,098
the resin they're with it and so because

3038
02:03:36,179 --> 02:03:42,859
of that CBD hole resin will almost

3039
02:03:38,099 --> 02:03:45,599
nearly always give you a a better

3040
02:03:42,859 --> 02:03:48,719
efficacious experience than than just

3041
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:51,719
isolate alone but again if you don't

3042
02:03:48,719 --> 02:03:54,480
have access to CBD resin or you can't

3043
02:03:51,719 --> 02:03:57,239
afford it at the amount that you need by

3044
02:03:54,479 --> 02:04:00,299
all means give a high quality CBD

3045
02:03:57,238 --> 02:04:01,379
isolate a try and see if that will help

3046
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:03,060
you

3047
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:05,400
all right so with that let's talk to

3048
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:08,159
let's talk some specific numbers so

3049
02:04:05,399 --> 02:04:10,679
looking back to 2015 when I was first

3050
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:13,079
recommending CBD to patients you know

3051
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:15,719
doctors willing to take a position at

3052
02:04:13,079 --> 02:04:19,158
all said that about 10 milligrams per

3053
02:04:15,719 --> 02:04:22,198
day of whole plant CBD

3054
02:04:19,158 --> 02:04:24,598
was good for as a supplement that would

3055
02:04:22,198 --> 02:04:28,259
support a healthy person to stay healthy

3056
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:31,319
and I think that the actuality for

3057
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:33,239
healthy people is probably twice that so

3058
02:04:31,319 --> 02:04:36,299
10 milligrams twice a day once in the

3059
02:04:33,238 --> 02:04:37,799
morning and once again after lunch not

3060
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:41,460
in the evening because about 20 percent

3061
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:43,440
of people find CBD stimulating and not

3062
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:44,939
stimulating in a way of like coffee or

3063
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:47,339
caffeine or anything like that more

3064
02:04:44,939 --> 02:04:49,319
stimulating where when people take the

3065
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:51,300
CBD suddenly their body wants to do that

3066
02:04:49,319 --> 02:04:54,118
housekeeping stuff like removing the

3067
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:57,659
plaque on the synapses in the brain and

3068
02:04:54,118 --> 02:04:58,198
cleaning up the mucus off the the

3069
02:04:57,658 --> 02:05:02,279
um

3070
02:04:58,198 --> 02:05:05,759
cilia in the gut and so you don't really

3071
02:05:02,279 --> 02:05:06,658
want to kick all that stuff off as you

3072
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:08,219
are

3073
02:05:06,658 --> 02:05:10,019
um you know trying to trying to go to

3074
02:05:08,219 --> 02:05:11,819
sleep and so but you know that's only

3075
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:16,260
about 20 of patients but I don't

3076
02:05:11,819 --> 02:05:18,299
recommend that people take CBD in the

3077
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:19,440
evening unless they've already had a

3078
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:20,940
trial right and you don't want to do

3079
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:22,198
your trial like on a work night or a

3080
02:05:20,939 --> 02:05:24,598
school night or something like that try

3081
02:05:22,198 --> 02:05:26,279
it on a try it on a Saturday so so that

3082
02:05:24,599 --> 02:05:30,119
you make sure that you're not reactive

3083
02:05:26,279 --> 02:05:32,698
to CBD and making it more difficult to

3084
02:05:30,118 --> 02:05:36,238
sleep so as soon as you have something

3085
02:05:32,698 --> 02:05:38,460
wrong that number of 10 milligrams twice

3086
02:05:36,238 --> 02:05:40,979
a day will jump up and if you're

3087
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:44,460
actively working on an issue like

3088
02:05:40,979 --> 02:05:46,439
arthritic inflammation migraines IBS or

3089
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:48,719
something like that you immediately are

3090
02:05:46,439 --> 02:05:51,598
going to want to jump up to more like 20

3091
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:52,198
to 40 milligrams twice a day

3092
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:54,719
um

3093
02:05:52,198 --> 02:05:56,638
and and that will work on your

3094
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:58,079
endocannabinoid system at a rate that

3095
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:59,940
you're likely to see something even

3096
02:05:58,079 --> 02:06:03,779
maybe within a week but I always

3097
02:05:59,939 --> 02:06:06,658
recommend a full month of daily CBD as a

3098
02:06:03,779 --> 02:06:09,359
trial because it it does take your body

3099
02:06:06,658 --> 02:06:10,979
some time to rebuild the endocannabinoid

3100
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:16,019
system enough to probably meet your

3101
02:06:10,979 --> 02:06:18,899
goals and we don't know how many uh

3102
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:21,060
CBD receptors that you have in your body

3103
02:06:18,899 --> 02:06:23,579
you might have more or less so it may

3104
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:26,099
take longer for your body to get the

3105
02:06:23,579 --> 02:06:29,099
reaction to the Daily supplementation of

3106
02:06:26,099 --> 02:06:32,340
CBD that you're looking for and you know

3107
02:06:29,099 --> 02:06:35,039
a month is it's not too long but it is

3108
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:36,960
enough right if if you've taken it for a

3109
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:39,118
month and you're taking enough every day

3110
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:40,560
and you're not really seeing results at

3111
02:06:39,118 --> 02:06:43,439
the end of the month well you might as

3112
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:45,060
well put your money elsewhere now if

3113
02:06:43,439 --> 02:06:46,859
you're dealing with something big and

3114
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:49,260
chronic like rheumatoid arthritis or

3115
02:06:46,859 --> 02:06:50,899
lupus or multiple sclerosis or just

3116
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:54,060
Wicked joint pain

3117
02:06:50,899 --> 02:06:56,098
the right answer for most people is

3118
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:58,199
probably to take as much as you can

3119
02:06:56,099 --> 02:06:59,579
afford and this is so frustrating to

3120
02:06:58,198 --> 02:07:01,198
patients when I'm talking to them

3121
02:06:59,579 --> 02:07:02,158
because

3122
02:07:01,198 --> 02:07:05,579
um you know if they've got something

3123
02:07:02,158 --> 02:07:08,879
serious and whole plant is expensive and

3124
02:07:05,579 --> 02:07:10,439
sometimes hard to find

3125
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,599
um they're just all like well how much

3126
02:07:10,439 --> 02:07:14,519
do I need and and I'm all like well you

3127
02:07:12,599 --> 02:07:16,020
know it's expensive how much can you

3128
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:18,480
afford it which is a very frustrating

3129
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:20,699
answer and I I understand that

3130
02:07:18,479 --> 02:07:23,218
so I try to give them an idea of how

3131
02:07:20,698 --> 02:07:24,479
many milligrams of CBD they want and

3132
02:07:23,219 --> 02:07:26,399
then they start doing the math and

3133
02:07:24,479 --> 02:07:30,539
they're like oh man you know that's

3134
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:32,879
that's half of a CBD syringe

3135
02:07:30,539 --> 02:07:34,500
and I need that you know twice a day so

3136
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,118
you're going through like one a day and

3137
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:38,219
depending where you are in the country

3138
02:07:36,118 --> 02:07:40,500
those CBD syringes can be anywhere

3139
02:07:38,219 --> 02:07:43,198
between 30 and 80 bucks each

3140
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:45,238
and it's not like the old days where um

3141
02:07:43,198 --> 02:07:47,819
you know in in many states Medical

3142
02:07:45,238 --> 02:07:49,500
Systems when you were buying from from

3143
02:07:47,819 --> 02:07:51,238
the grower

3144
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:54,238
um there was always a discount to people

3145
02:07:51,238 --> 02:07:56,519
who had uh chronic illnesses especially

3146
02:07:54,238 --> 02:07:57,779
people who um were fighting cancer

3147
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,739
because by the time you're fighting

3148
02:07:57,779 --> 02:08:01,019
cancer

3149
02:07:58,738 --> 02:08:04,500
most people are broke when they when

3150
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:07,500
they find their way to cannabis and so

3151
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:10,738
um it's very challenging to recommend

3152
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:12,960
CBD for people who who need a lot of it

3153
02:08:10,738 --> 02:08:15,000
and you know perhaps for some of those

3154
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:16,980
people a good solution will be to

3155
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,618
purchase CBD

3156
02:08:16,979 --> 02:08:22,259
um whole plant oil in a syringe and then

3157
02:08:19,618 --> 02:08:24,179
maybe even spike it with with isolate to

3158
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:25,739
get more bang for your buck

3159
02:08:24,179 --> 02:08:27,960
now

3160
02:08:25,738 --> 02:08:31,019
um I have a chronic disease and I take

3161
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:32,880
80 milligrams twice a day but I grow my

3162
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:35,340
own and I make my own oil so my costs

3163
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:37,380
are much lower than at a licensed store

3164
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:39,060
and this again is why I'm a big

3165
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:41,520
proponent of cannabis patient

3166
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:43,980
self-sufficiency and I really hope that

3167
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:45,480
our society continues to increase our

3168
02:08:43,979 --> 02:08:48,718
support of that

3169
02:08:45,479 --> 02:08:52,979
so before I go on to the Black Swan

3170
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:55,380
patients around CBD I want to kind of

3171
02:08:52,979 --> 02:08:57,000
like wrap up the numbers of dosing that

3172
02:08:55,380 --> 02:08:59,880
I was suggesting into a little nicer

3173
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:02,099
package because I can imagine that it

3174
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:04,020
might feel a little a little vague at

3175
02:09:02,099 --> 02:09:06,360
this point especially when I've all like

3176
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:08,099
take as much as you can afford right so

3177
02:09:06,359 --> 02:09:13,019
so we essentially have got three

3178
02:09:08,099 --> 02:09:15,659
different levels of of dosing and and to

3179
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:18,360
find out where your dosing may need to

3180
02:09:15,658 --> 02:09:20,339
be for your particular ailment again I

3181
02:09:18,359 --> 02:09:21,000
send you back to

3182
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:24,500
um

3183
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:27,420
the project CBD site because on Project

3184
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:29,460
cbd.org you can find the actual studies

3185
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:31,739
and you can find out how much CBD

3186
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:33,359
they're giving the patients what their

3187
02:09:31,738 --> 02:09:37,079
results were like and if they were using

3188
02:09:33,359 --> 02:09:39,439
a whole plant or an isolate preparation

3189
02:09:37,079 --> 02:09:42,960
and because at this point you understand

3190
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:45,960
that the whole plant tends to be more

3191
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:48,719
more effective and then isolate you can

3192
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:51,658
you can start to kind of gauge where

3193
02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:55,079
your particular needs are for where you

3194
02:09:51,658 --> 02:09:57,118
want to start your your dosing and then

3195
02:09:55,079 --> 02:10:01,198
you can start making your changes after

3196
02:09:57,118 --> 02:10:03,779
after you see or don't see effects so

3197
02:10:01,198 --> 02:10:05,158
those those three levels are if you're

3198
02:10:03,779 --> 02:10:06,658
if you're generally healthy and you want

3199
02:10:05,158 --> 02:10:09,238
to stay that way

3200
02:10:06,658 --> 02:10:11,460
um shoot for 10 milligrams of CBD twice

3201
02:10:09,238 --> 02:10:12,479
a day as a minimum if you can afford or

3202
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:14,760
get your hands on more well that's

3203
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:16,738
that's all the better but

3204
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:18,960
um but the the doctors that I have

3205
02:10:16,738 --> 02:10:20,339
talked to and interviewed say that you

3206
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:22,679
know if you're not actually actively

3207
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:24,719
trying to fix something taking 10

3208
02:10:22,679 --> 02:10:27,840
milligrams twice a day for 20 milligrams

3209
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:29,579
a day is a great place to go the next

3210
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:31,619
level up are if there is something

3211
02:10:29,579 --> 02:10:33,118
actively you're trying to work on like

3212
02:10:31,618 --> 02:10:35,519
your

3213
02:10:33,118 --> 02:10:38,339
um like migraines like IBS like

3214
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:41,159
arthritic inflammation in the arms or or

3215
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:43,020
in your knees or whatever and that that

3216
02:10:41,158 --> 02:10:45,420
you're really talking about

3217
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:47,880
um like 40 milligrams twice a day at

3218
02:10:45,420 --> 02:10:50,340
that middle middle place and then of

3219
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:52,139
course there's this high end where you

3220
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:54,480
know if if they're using 200 milligram

3221
02:10:52,139 --> 02:10:56,880
Doses and trials

3222
02:10:54,479 --> 02:11:00,359
um not a lot of people can afford 200

3223
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:04,380
milligrams of whole plant CBD or maybe

3224
02:11:00,359 --> 02:11:06,299
even isolate CBD and so you just you

3225
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:08,539
know you take as much as you can and and

3226
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:11,400
perhaps you can find yourself

3227
02:11:08,539 --> 02:11:12,899
a syringe of CBD hole plant and then

3228
02:11:11,399 --> 02:11:15,118
spike it with some isolate and get

3229
02:11:12,899 --> 02:11:17,279
creative and so

3230
02:11:15,118 --> 02:11:19,139
um while that seems a bit on the vague

3231
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:21,300
side there's a lot of different things

3232
02:11:19,139 --> 02:11:24,480
there's dozens of different ailments

3233
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:26,760
that CBD can help with and

3234
02:11:24,479 --> 02:11:29,279
um you know this isn't a show just about

3235
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:32,340
dosing CBD I want to teach you how to

3236
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:33,960
think about how to dose CBD and then you

3237
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:36,599
can continue with a little bit more of

3238
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:39,000
your own research and this will provide

3239
02:11:36,599 --> 02:11:41,819
a a context for you to put that new

3240
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:44,819
information in as you are designing your

3241
02:11:41,819 --> 02:11:48,658
own protocol all right so one note on

3242
02:11:44,819 --> 02:11:50,880
Black Swan patients around CBD so I have

3243
02:11:48,658 --> 02:11:53,098
worked with one immune compromised

3244
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:56,099
patient who also had rheumatoid

3245
02:11:53,099 --> 02:11:58,440
arthritis and we become delirious and

3246
02:11:56,099 --> 02:11:59,880
experience missing time after simply

3247
02:11:58,439 --> 02:12:02,759
ingesting

3248
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:04,260
10 milligrams of CBD in a whole plant

3249
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:05,760
cannabis oil

3250
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:07,800
and

3251
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:10,139
you know it was really hard to believe

3252
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:12,560
it unless I had seen it and I saw it a

3253
02:12:10,139 --> 02:12:16,679
few times and we know that it wasn't

3254
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:19,739
very high in THC in the oil because it

3255
02:12:16,679 --> 02:12:21,840
was hemp extracted and lab tested and so

3256
02:12:19,738 --> 02:12:25,198
we're certain that the THC component was

3257
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:27,440
under one milligram and yet something in

3258
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:30,000
this patient was definitely activated

3259
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:31,919
and on more than one occasion because

3260
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,840
the patient had a long history of using

3261
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:36,800
this same oil

3262
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:40,560
suddenly when they took the oil

3263
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:42,960
at this low amount of just 10 milligrams

3264
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:45,659
they were they were losing entire

3265
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:48,359
afternoons and and were kind of

3266
02:12:45,658 --> 02:12:49,738
delirious and tired and had to sleep the

3267
02:12:48,359 --> 02:12:52,618
rest of the day

3268
02:12:49,738 --> 02:12:55,678
we still don't know what that is and

3269
02:12:52,618 --> 02:12:57,059
when I talked to you know canaanopathic

3270
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:58,679
scientists

3271
02:12:57,060 --> 02:13:00,539
um they they're skeptical and they don't

3272
02:12:58,679 --> 02:13:02,039
want to believe me but I've been doing

3273
02:13:00,539 --> 02:13:06,060
this a long time now and I know the

3274
02:13:02,039 --> 02:13:07,319
stuff to rule out and so I see it so I

3275
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:11,219
don't really tell you this to caution

3276
02:13:07,319 --> 02:13:13,679
you against CBD because CBD is so safe

3277
02:13:11,219 --> 02:13:15,118
um but you know this is an

3278
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:17,399
extraordinarily rare thing and I bring

3279
02:13:15,118 --> 02:13:19,679
it up in case you are a caregiver and

3280
02:13:17,399 --> 02:13:20,939
you come across a patient like this

3281
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:23,219
um no just know that it's possible

3282
02:13:20,939 --> 02:13:25,319
humans are incredibly varied and knowing

3283
02:13:23,219 --> 02:13:27,960
that something is possible even if rare

3284
02:13:25,319 --> 02:13:31,078
can help us guide patients should they

3285
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:33,779
have this sort of rare reaction

3286
02:13:31,078 --> 02:13:37,979
so before we close this CBD section it's

3287
02:13:33,779 --> 02:13:40,738
worthwhile to mention that cbda

3288
02:13:37,979 --> 02:13:43,559
um which is the acid and raw form

3289
02:13:40,738 --> 02:13:46,019
unheated form of CBD that is present in

3290
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:49,560
the cannabis plant also has a strong

3291
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:52,860
affinity for the five ht1a receptor even

3292
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:55,800
more so than CBD and pre-clinical

3293
02:13:52,859 --> 02:13:58,920
studies indicate that cbda is also a

3294
02:13:55,800 --> 02:14:01,619
potent and aimedic for nausea stronger

3295
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:03,599
than CBD or THC which also have the

3296
02:14:01,618 --> 02:14:05,819
anti-nausea properties and the reason

3297
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:09,000
why I dropped this in here is just to

3298
02:14:05,819 --> 02:14:11,759
kind of uh ignite the idea in you that

3299
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,158
While most of the preparations of

3300
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:16,139
medicine that we have are not the acid

3301
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:21,299
forms so most of the time what is

3302
02:14:16,139 --> 02:14:24,300
available to us is CBD not CBD cbda and

3303
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:27,360
by the time we take THC it's THC and not

3304
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:28,820
thca we need to remember that the acid

3305
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:31,279
forms that have not be been

3306
02:14:28,819 --> 02:14:35,158
decarboxylated or heated

3307
02:14:31,279 --> 02:14:37,979
they have their own sets of ways that

3308
02:14:35,158 --> 02:14:40,559
they help the endocannabinoid system and

3309
02:14:37,979 --> 02:14:42,919
and don't be shy about taking your

3310
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:45,719
cannabinoids raw right from the plant

3311
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:49,078
say for example by making hash and just

3312
02:14:45,719 --> 02:14:51,840
eating it instead of using some kind of

3313
02:14:49,078 --> 02:14:53,578
preparation that you have to heat it

3314
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:56,099
either by

3315
02:14:53,578 --> 02:14:59,219
uh making an extracted cannabis oil

3316
02:14:56,099 --> 02:15:00,900
which you have to heat to remove the

3317
02:14:59,219 --> 02:15:04,319
um the ethanol

3318
02:15:00,899 --> 02:15:07,618
um or or you know traditionally smoking

3319
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:09,658
THC where the burning of it is the

3320
02:15:07,618 --> 02:15:11,519
decarboxylation process

3321
02:15:09,658 --> 02:15:12,960
so it's just it's just valuable to

3322
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:14,699
understand that these acid forms of

3323
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:16,679
these cannabinoids often have entirely

3324
02:15:14,698 --> 02:15:18,479
different useful properties than their

3325
02:15:16,679 --> 02:15:21,179
non-acid forms

3326
02:15:18,479 --> 02:15:22,019
okay so the third one we're going to

3327
02:15:21,179 --> 02:15:24,840
cover

3328
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:26,760
um in this set is is CBG and and we're

3329
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:29,460
going to cover this um in a shorter

3330
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:31,560
amount of time than THC and CBD because

3331
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:33,539
I would say that the vast majority of

3332
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:36,539
people who are here are looking for

3333
02:15:33,539 --> 02:15:38,039
dosing recommendations for THC and CBD

3334
02:15:36,539 --> 02:15:39,420
because those are the ones that have

3335
02:15:38,039 --> 02:15:42,000
been studied the most and the ones that

3336
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:44,219
we can get our hands on the most but CBG

3337
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:48,960
is now becoming increasingly available

3338
02:15:44,219 --> 02:15:52,139
ever since some CBG dominant

3339
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:54,480
um cannabis plants found their way into

3340
02:15:52,139 --> 02:15:58,078
the market you know about five years ago

3341
02:15:54,479 --> 02:16:01,500
now so so now there are many hemp Farms

3342
02:15:58,078 --> 02:16:04,799
that are growing CBG CBG dominant plants

3343
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:06,719
and so CBG is now available in isolate

3344
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:10,199
form and

3345
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:12,960
um and as a whole plant resin too I must

3346
02:16:10,198 --> 02:16:16,078
admit I don't see CBG resin available

3347
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:17,939
just anywhere and um you know I have to

3348
02:16:16,078 --> 02:16:20,158
grow my own plants and make it myself if

3349
02:16:17,939 --> 02:16:22,158
I want it because it's not it's not

3350
02:16:20,158 --> 02:16:26,098
available in the licensed recreational

3351
02:16:22,158 --> 02:16:29,158
system where I live so one of the newest

3352
02:16:26,099 --> 02:16:32,700
cannabinoids to get attention and one

3353
02:16:29,158 --> 02:16:34,199
with very specific New Uses is CBG can

3354
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:36,960
have a girol

3355
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:39,179
so I'm going to delineate two specific

3356
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:41,879
uses for CBG and then and then give you

3357
02:16:39,179 --> 02:16:45,719
the dosing region for it so we found

3358
02:16:41,879 --> 02:16:49,018
when we did our research here on Vashon

3359
02:16:45,718 --> 02:16:50,579
Island three years ago when we gave CBG

3360
02:16:49,019 --> 02:16:53,159
to a round of patients and then did a

3361
02:16:50,579 --> 02:16:54,478
questionnaire afterwards that the number

3362
02:16:53,159 --> 02:16:57,179
one

3363
02:16:54,478 --> 02:16:58,679
um uh the number one thing that people

3364
02:16:57,179 --> 02:17:01,978
responded to was that it helped

3365
02:16:58,679 --> 02:17:04,500
neuropathic pain so that's pain from

3366
02:17:01,978 --> 02:17:07,138
some kind of nervous system damage or

3367
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:10,138
dysregulation like like a stabbing pain

3368
02:17:07,138 --> 02:17:12,779
that seems without cause or cold or numb

3369
02:17:10,138 --> 02:17:15,179
fingers or limbs that feeling of pins

3370
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:19,320
and needles for example

3371
02:17:15,179 --> 02:17:21,960
um and especially on your um periphery

3372
02:17:19,319 --> 02:17:26,638
right the external parts of your body

3373
02:17:21,959 --> 02:17:30,000
and so when people uh take CBG

3374
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:31,799
um it decreases that experience and um

3375
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,260
it is true we don't we don't exactly

3376
02:17:31,799 --> 02:17:36,119
know why yet but we do know that it

3377
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:36,840
happens and it happens

3378
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:38,639
um

3379
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:40,799
pretty consistently across the board

3380
02:17:38,638 --> 02:17:42,358
some of the some of the things that

3381
02:17:40,799 --> 02:17:45,478
cannabis help with we have to very much

3382
02:17:42,359 --> 02:17:47,700
say oh your mileage may vary but these

3383
02:17:45,478 --> 02:17:50,159
two attributes in CBG seems to be pretty

3384
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:52,079
reliable across the board and one of the

3385
02:17:50,159 --> 02:17:55,079
great things about CBG is that it

3386
02:17:52,079 --> 02:17:58,920
doesn't have intoxication so it it

3387
02:17:55,079 --> 02:18:02,638
unless you are are taking a CBG from a

3388
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:05,638
plant that it's married to THC in the

3389
02:18:02,638 --> 02:18:09,358
preparation like like you don't grow a

3390
02:18:05,638 --> 02:18:12,299
CBG hemp plant in instead you you grow a

3391
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:15,239
one-to-one plant that's one part CBG and

3392
02:18:12,299 --> 02:18:17,159
one part THC so long as you're you're

3393
02:18:15,239 --> 02:18:19,439
not intentionally adding the THC

3394
02:18:17,159 --> 02:18:21,718
component CBG on its own won't get you

3395
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:25,859
high which makes it very reliable for

3396
02:18:21,718 --> 02:18:27,718
lots of people who have pain but they

3397
02:18:25,859 --> 02:18:30,059
don't want to feel any level of

3398
02:18:27,718 --> 02:18:32,098
intoxication and CBG is incredibly

3399
02:18:30,058 --> 02:18:35,518
reliable for this

3400
02:18:32,099 --> 02:18:38,219
the Second Great use for CBG is actually

3401
02:18:35,519 --> 02:18:40,139
anxiety I was really surprised when we

3402
02:18:38,218 --> 02:18:41,938
got back the questionnaires and and

3403
02:18:40,138 --> 02:18:43,920
there were there were multiple different

3404
02:18:41,939 --> 02:18:45,960
flavors of anxiety that people found

3405
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:47,398
great help with so

3406
02:18:45,959 --> 02:18:49,199
um the first one was social anxiety

3407
02:18:47,398 --> 02:18:50,760
people said that it kind of like calmed

3408
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:53,519
them down and allowed them to be social

3409
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:56,359
and interact with other people uh we

3410
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:58,920
also heard from people that um it

3411
02:18:56,359 --> 02:19:01,679
softened performance anxiety so public

3412
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:03,179
speaking or at the beginning of covid

3413
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:04,558
when everyone was getting on Zoom

3414
02:19:03,179 --> 02:19:07,558
meetings for the first time you know

3415
02:19:04,558 --> 02:19:10,138
Zoom meetings are very socially awkward

3416
02:19:07,558 --> 02:19:12,179
situations and a lot of people found it

3417
02:19:10,138 --> 02:19:15,000
very uncomfortable to be doing these

3418
02:19:12,179 --> 02:19:18,179
Zoom meetings and CBG helped people like

3419
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:21,299
cool out so that they could tolerate the

3420
02:19:18,179 --> 02:19:23,819
the awkwardness stay calm and engaged

3421
02:19:21,299 --> 02:19:24,898
and and be productive in their Zoom

3422
02:19:23,819 --> 02:19:26,819
meetings

3423
02:19:24,898 --> 02:19:29,519
and then the third one was a real

3424
02:19:26,819 --> 02:19:31,679
surprise many patients would explain it

3425
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:33,300
to me by by putting their their hands on

3426
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:35,219
their hips and and thrusting their chest

3427
02:19:33,299 --> 02:19:36,599
out like a superhero would and and

3428
02:19:35,218 --> 02:19:39,419
they'd say like it gives me the

3429
02:19:36,599 --> 02:19:41,760
confidence of a superhero and after I

3430
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:43,439
heard that enough times I I really had

3431
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:45,120
to start like listening and thinking

3432
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:47,639
about it because

3433
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:49,439
people really seem to get an increase of

3434
02:19:47,638 --> 02:19:51,959
Confidence from it like and how they

3435
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:55,020
described it is I feel like

3436
02:19:51,959 --> 02:19:57,599
um I feel like I have the resources to

3437
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:59,819
get what I need to get done today versus

3438
02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:02,220
you know if you wake up with rumination

3439
02:19:59,819 --> 02:20:03,840
and you're like oh my gosh I just don't

3440
02:20:02,219 --> 02:20:05,398
I just don't have what it takes to get

3441
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:07,799
through the day that can really just

3442
02:20:05,398 --> 02:20:09,439
like hold you back your entire day but

3443
02:20:07,799 --> 02:20:12,358
if you start your day with a little CBG

3444
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:16,319
and suddenly you're all like okay I can

3445
02:20:12,359 --> 02:20:18,479
handle this let's go and um it showed up

3446
02:20:16,319 --> 02:20:20,340
very significantly in the questionnaires

3447
02:20:18,478 --> 02:20:22,319
that we got back but then also in the

3448
02:20:20,340 --> 02:20:24,420
three years since then

3449
02:20:22,319 --> 02:20:27,299
um uh I just I just see it in patients

3450
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:29,340
all the time when they when they

3451
02:20:27,299 --> 02:20:30,898
tell me that they have sourced it and

3452
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:32,780
they're using it and they're loving it

3453
02:20:30,898 --> 02:20:36,959
and they never want to not have it again

3454
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:39,680
and so um CBG Canada all can be relied

3455
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:42,839
on for um as a really reliable

3456
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:44,220
anti-anxiety with no intoxication okay

3457
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:46,079
so now the specific numbers and

3458
02:20:44,219 --> 02:20:47,959
milligrams that that we're seeing people

3459
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:51,478
have success with

3460
02:20:47,959 --> 02:20:56,579
10 milligrams of CBG every three hours

3461
02:20:51,478 --> 02:20:58,619
does a great job for both so if you want

3462
02:20:56,579 --> 02:21:01,020
to use it as a pain reliever 10

3463
02:20:58,620 --> 02:21:03,920
milligrams of CBG every three hours does

3464
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:06,720
does has usually has fantastic results

3465
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:09,299
if you have got a very high background

3466
02:21:06,719 --> 02:21:11,398
anxiety you might need to take CBG

3467
02:21:09,299 --> 02:21:13,920
multiple times throughout the day but

3468
02:21:11,398 --> 02:21:16,739
really for most folks they'll take it in

3469
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:19,260
the morning and it kind of sets them on

3470
02:21:16,739 --> 02:21:21,478
the on an anti-anxiety path for the day

3471
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:23,520
and they just seem to be like okay with

3472
02:21:21,478 --> 02:21:25,379
that one dose now if they have like a

3473
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:28,079
stress event in the afternoon many

3474
02:21:25,379 --> 02:21:30,659
people will take it again but really

3475
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:32,340
um unless you already have chronic

3476
02:21:30,659 --> 02:21:34,020
anxiety if you just like have a bit of

3477
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:35,939
anxiety or if you have like morning

3478
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:38,159
ruminations that you need to get rid of

3479
02:21:35,939 --> 02:21:40,500
you may get away with just taking 10

3480
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:41,639
milligrams of whole plant CBG just once

3481
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:43,859
in the morning and good for the rest of

3482
02:21:41,639 --> 02:21:45,239
the day but you know if your anxiety

3483
02:21:43,859 --> 02:21:47,280
continues throughout the day you can

3484
02:21:45,239 --> 02:21:49,439
certainly take it um as needed because

3485
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:52,020
taking more um has got no negative

3486
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:55,020
impact now 20 milligrams makes it happen

3487
02:21:52,020 --> 02:21:56,280
even faster and with a bit more

3488
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:59,579
um spunk

3489
02:21:56,280 --> 02:22:01,500
so let's say that um you know generally

3490
02:21:59,579 --> 02:22:04,978
you take 10 milligrams just because

3491
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:06,600
you've got a high background anxiety but

3492
02:22:04,978 --> 02:22:09,779
um today you need to give a presentation

3493
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:12,540
right and so your your your anxiety is

3494
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:15,239
going to be especially peaked well then

3495
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:17,760
go ahead and take 20 milligrams and and

3496
02:22:15,239 --> 02:22:19,739
don't monkey around with it right

3497
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:21,239
um and those are those are great low

3498
02:22:19,739 --> 02:22:23,299
numbers right you know if you if you

3499
02:22:21,239 --> 02:22:26,100
think back to the THC we were talking

3500
02:22:23,299 --> 02:22:28,559
you know um you know ten you know five

3501
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:32,340
or ten but then the CBD we were talking

3502
02:22:28,559 --> 02:22:35,039
80 and 200 well this is back down to uh

3503
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:38,280
THC levels more like 10 or 20 milligrams

3504
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:40,439
and makes it much more affordable if you

3505
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:41,880
can find it because the CBG that is

3506
02:22:40,439 --> 02:22:44,460
available to you

3507
02:22:41,879 --> 02:22:48,059
um just lasts a whole lot longer

3508
02:22:44,459 --> 02:22:49,559
okay so uh to wrap up this second set we

3509
02:22:48,059 --> 02:22:51,359
looked at

3510
02:22:49,559 --> 02:22:56,000
um the the you know how to think about

3511
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:58,439
dosing for THC and for CBD and for CBG

3512
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:01,318
and granted there are a lot of other

3513
02:22:58,439 --> 02:23:02,220
cannabinoids out there but

3514
02:23:01,318 --> 02:23:05,579
um

3515
02:23:02,219 --> 02:23:08,219
between the lack of availability in most

3516
02:23:05,579 --> 02:23:11,639
places and the lack of the research

3517
02:23:08,219 --> 02:23:13,398
about what is an effective dose

3518
02:23:11,639 --> 02:23:17,279
um I don't want to give you information

3519
02:23:13,398 --> 02:23:19,260
that is not solidified yet and and so

3520
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:22,500
since these are the three cannabinoids

3521
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:25,318
that most people have easier access to

3522
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:29,280
this is this is what we're going to talk

3523
02:23:25,318 --> 02:23:31,500
about today and as new cannabinoids

3524
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:33,300
become more available in the future like

3525
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:36,059
for example CBN we're going to be seeing

3526
02:23:33,299 --> 02:23:37,799
a lot more of CBN soon

3527
02:23:36,059 --> 02:23:38,939
um you know when that comes you will

3528
02:23:37,799 --> 02:23:40,079
have

3529
02:23:38,939 --> 02:23:43,620
um you will have the proper

3530
02:23:40,079 --> 02:23:44,879
understanding and context to look at the

3531
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:48,120
studies that are coming out and being

3532
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:50,938
published on Project cbd.org

3533
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:53,220
and learning how to add that to your own

3534
02:23:50,939 --> 02:23:54,000
particular Health protocol with cannabis

3535
02:23:53,219 --> 02:23:57,059
medicine

3536
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,559
all right so um we're going to take our

3537
02:23:57,059 --> 02:24:01,019
short break and when we come back with

3538
02:23:58,559 --> 02:24:03,000
set three we're going to talk about

3539
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:05,040
um some use cases

3540
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:07,439
um uh like arthritis and leg and joint

3541
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:08,580
pain and neuropathy and and and we'll

3542
02:24:07,439 --> 02:24:09,840
just talk about

3543
02:24:08,579 --> 02:24:12,420
um thinking through some of these use

3544
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:14,398
cases to make sure that you really

3545
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:15,859
understand how to Think Through doing

3546
02:24:14,398 --> 02:24:18,779
your dosing because like I've said

3547
02:24:15,859 --> 02:24:20,520
everybody's dosing in the end is unique

3548
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:23,220
we we can give you these guides to get

3549
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:26,460
you started but in the end you will be

3550
02:24:23,219 --> 02:24:27,898
divide devising your own protocol as you

3551
02:24:26,459 --> 02:24:30,059
get to understand how cannabis medicine

3552
02:24:27,898 --> 02:24:32,879
works and how it works with your own

3553
02:24:30,059 --> 02:24:34,260
body so we're going to take a short

3554
02:24:32,879 --> 02:24:35,639
break and be right back you are

3555
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:38,219
listening to the 100th episode of

3556
02:24:35,639 --> 02:24:40,019
shaping fire and I am Shango Los without

3557
02:24:38,219 --> 02:24:41,760
these advertisers shaping fire would not

3558
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:44,040
happen so please support them and let

3559
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:45,960
you know let them know you heard them on

3560
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:48,960
shaping fire

3561
02:24:45,959 --> 02:24:48,959
foreign

3562
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:53,880
s become more demanding and consumers

3563
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:55,559
become more educated it is increasingly

3564
02:24:53,879 --> 02:24:57,959
important to avoid the use of chemical

3565
02:24:55,559 --> 02:24:59,939
pesticides when cultivating cannabis

3566
02:24:57,959 --> 02:25:02,039
beneficial insects have been used for

3567
02:24:59,939 --> 02:25:04,680
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and

3568
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:06,420
ornamental plant industry and today many

3569
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:08,280
cannabis cultivators are moving from

3570
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:09,600
sprays and chemicals to beneficial

3571
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:12,540
insects

3572
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:15,059
copert has the beneficial insects mites

3573
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:17,700

host shangolos so here we are in the

3692
02:29:34,859 --> 02:29:38,700
third set the big wrap up so during the

3693
02:29:36,898 --> 02:29:40,920
first set we learned about how our

3694
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:42,840
endocannabinoid system functions and

3695
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:44,700
considered some of the different ways to

3696
02:29:42,840 --> 02:29:47,760
take cannabis medicine into your body

3697
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:49,800
based on what is going to be best to

3698
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:51,960
suit the ailment that you are working

3699
02:29:49,799 --> 02:29:54,959
with during the second set we talked

3700
02:29:51,959 --> 02:29:58,318
about very specific dosing strategies

3701
02:29:54,959 --> 02:30:00,419
and how to consider dosing protocols for

3702
02:29:58,318 --> 02:30:04,318
the most popular three cannabinoids that

3703
02:30:00,420 --> 02:30:07,859
people look to supplement with THC CBD

3704
02:30:04,318 --> 02:30:09,659
and CBG and here in set three which

3705
02:30:07,859 --> 02:30:12,359
hopefully will be uh shorter than the

3706
02:30:09,659 --> 02:30:16,439
first two we're going to talk about

3707
02:30:12,359 --> 02:30:17,220
um one two three four five six specific

3708
02:30:16,439 --> 02:30:19,380
um

3709
02:30:17,219 --> 02:30:22,079
um issues that people come to me asking

3710
02:30:19,379 --> 02:30:24,119
for dosing strategies for and we'll go

3711
02:30:22,079 --> 02:30:25,379
over those kind of swiftly since since

3712
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:27,540
you've heard most of the analysis

3713
02:30:25,379 --> 02:30:29,398
already earlier in the show I'm just

3714
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:31,620
going to tie them together

3715
02:30:29,398 --> 02:30:33,358
um which should you know kind of give

3716
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:35,520
you a road map to how you can think

3717
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:37,380
about them yourself so all right let's

3718
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:39,120
get right to it so the first one we're

3719
02:30:37,379 --> 02:30:42,059
going to talk about is kind of this

3720
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:45,600
bucket of issues which is arthritis leg

3721
02:30:42,059 --> 02:30:48,478
and joint pain and neuropathy the thing

3722
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:52,159
that these all have in common is that it

3723
02:30:48,478 --> 02:30:56,579
is an ongoing chronic discomfort or pain

3724
02:30:52,159 --> 02:30:59,100
most likely caused by inflammation and

3725
02:30:56,579 --> 02:31:01,799
so even though it manifests differently

3726
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:03,899
in these different issues they really do

3727
02:31:01,799 --> 02:31:06,358
have a lot of similarity in how we're

3728
02:31:03,898 --> 02:31:08,398
going to treat them and so if somebody

3729
02:31:06,359 --> 02:31:10,620
came to me with one of the these this is

3730
02:31:08,398 --> 02:31:14,159
what I would say first of all I would

3731
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:16,979
recommend a 2.5 to 5 milligrams of THC

3732
02:31:14,159 --> 02:31:18,719
if they are intolerant of t THC or are

3733
02:31:16,978 --> 02:31:20,459
especially concerned about you know

3734
02:31:18,719 --> 02:31:21,779
feeling out of control or high in any

3735
02:31:20,459 --> 02:31:24,239
way

3736
02:31:21,780 --> 02:31:26,640
um and then if they well I would also

3737
02:31:24,239 --> 02:31:29,639
tell them that once they built up a

3738
02:31:26,639 --> 02:31:32,398
comfort with uh taking THC or if they

3739
02:31:29,639 --> 02:31:33,898
already take THC perhaps they are a you

3740
02:31:32,398 --> 02:31:36,059
know a recreational toker or something

3741
02:31:33,898 --> 02:31:38,340
then go ahead and start with five to ten

3742
02:31:36,059 --> 02:31:39,779
milligrams you know if they are THC

3743
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:40,920
tolerance

3744
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:42,720
um you know if you've built up a

3745
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:44,879
tolerance from daily use this number can

3746
02:31:42,719 --> 02:31:46,799
go as high as 100 milligrams or more as

3747
02:31:44,879 --> 02:31:48,478
we've already talked about these

3748
02:31:46,799 --> 02:31:50,519
patients could probably benefit from a

3749
02:31:48,478 --> 02:31:51,898
tolerance break from the THC and I

3750
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:54,359
understand that some patients cannot

3751
02:31:51,898 --> 02:31:56,279
live a day without THC so I'm not being

3752
02:31:54,359 --> 02:31:58,200
cocky about it or ableist what I'm

3753
02:31:56,280 --> 02:32:01,380
trying to say is if you can work it out

3754
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:02,939
for a day or two or more to not take THC

3755
02:32:01,379 --> 02:32:05,459
to bring your tolerance down from

3756
02:32:02,939 --> 02:32:07,739
needing to take 100 milligrams a day it

3757
02:32:05,459 --> 02:32:09,959
would probably be both physically and

3758
02:32:07,739 --> 02:32:11,879
financially of benefit to you

3759
02:32:09,959 --> 02:32:13,639
and the last thing I would say here is

3760
02:32:11,879 --> 02:32:16,199
to consider a topical

3761
02:32:13,639 --> 02:32:19,079
with arthritis and leg and joint pain

3762
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:22,500
and often neuropathy you can actually

3763
02:32:19,079 --> 02:32:23,939
use a THC based topical localized and

3764
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:26,040
targeted to where the discomfort is

3765
02:32:23,939 --> 02:32:29,100
coming from and then that way you are

3766
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:32,100
taking cannabinoids orally which will

3767
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:34,260
help with a systemic anti-inflammation

3768
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:36,479
but also when you place the topical

3769
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:38,280
locally you're getting you know you're

3770
02:32:36,478 --> 02:32:40,760
doubling down on making sure that you're

3771
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:43,979
applying cannabinoids in the proper area

3772
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:45,478
if you are making your own tinctures and

3773
02:32:43,978 --> 02:32:47,938
you are aware that topicals are

3774
02:32:45,478 --> 02:32:51,239
expensive I encourage you to just take

3775
02:32:47,939 --> 02:32:53,100
some of your tincture and you know a

3776
02:32:51,239 --> 02:32:55,139
Ramekin like they serve you ketchup in

3777
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:56,579
at the restaurant go ahead and put some

3778
02:32:55,139 --> 02:32:59,159
kind of a hand lotion or a massage

3779
02:32:56,579 --> 02:33:01,500
lotion or like Lubriderm or something in

3780
02:32:59,159 --> 02:33:02,939
one of those little ketchup ramekins and

3781
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:04,559
then put just a little bit of your

3782
02:33:02,939 --> 02:33:06,840
tincture in it and swirl it around with

3783
02:33:04,559 --> 02:33:09,539
with your finger and now you have made

3784
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:10,739
instant topical it's what I used in the

3785
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:12,540
early days

3786
02:33:10,739 --> 02:33:15,539
um before I learned how to make topicals

3787
02:33:12,540 --> 02:33:16,859
and it works absolutely fantastic so you

3788
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:18,479
can consider that and save a lot of

3789
02:33:16,859 --> 02:33:20,280
money on the kind of prices that they

3790
02:33:18,478 --> 02:33:22,318
charge for topicals at the licensed

3791
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:24,239
stores all right so that's a quick run

3792
02:33:22,318 --> 02:33:26,579
through of arthritis leg and joint pain

3793
02:33:24,239 --> 02:33:28,500
and neuropathy let's talk about cancer

3794
02:33:26,579 --> 02:33:31,020
symptom relief so we're not talking

3795
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:32,639
about the full fight cancer protocol

3796
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:34,500
here and and hopefully we'll do this

3797
02:33:32,639 --> 02:33:36,779
again sometime and I'll talk about the

3798
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:38,818
cancer fighting protocol in detail what

3799
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:41,640
we're talking about here is

3800
02:33:38,818 --> 02:33:44,519
um for patients who have got cancer and

3801
02:33:41,639 --> 02:33:46,318
are either simply just suffering from

3802
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:48,060
the cancer and they they're that's all

3803
02:33:46,318 --> 02:33:51,119
they're doing so they're looking for

3804
02:33:48,059 --> 02:33:53,840
Comfort or more commonly they've chosen

3805
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:56,399
to go the route of some variety of

3806
02:33:53,840 --> 02:34:00,180
chemotherapy and so they are dealing

3807
02:33:56,398 --> 02:34:03,539
with the symptoms from the chemo stacked

3808
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:06,720
on top of the discomfort and from the

3809
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:07,560
cancer experience itself so for these

3810
02:34:06,719 --> 02:34:11,299
people

3811
02:34:07,559 --> 02:34:13,799
the first thing I would recommend is THC

3812
02:34:11,299 --> 02:34:16,079
and that's going to help them in so many

3813
02:34:13,799 --> 02:34:18,299
ways the first thing it's going to do is

3814
02:34:16,079 --> 02:34:20,939
just make them a little more comfortable

3815
02:34:18,299 --> 02:34:23,279
in their body by the time cancer has

3816
02:34:20,939 --> 02:34:26,818
gotten Advanced and especially if you

3817
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:29,460
are taking any kind of chemo your your

3818
02:34:26,818 --> 02:34:32,459
human meat suit is just not feeling like

3819
02:34:29,459 --> 02:34:33,839
your ally anymore and you've got aches

3820
02:34:32,459 --> 02:34:36,000
and pains and things aren't working

3821
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:39,180
properly and fluids aren't moving

3822
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:42,600
properly and it's just all around lack

3823
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:45,898
of comfort but taking 5 to 10 milligrams

3824
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:48,239
of THC based tincture is going to put

3825
02:34:45,898 --> 02:34:49,920
you in a place where you feel a little

3826
02:34:48,239 --> 02:34:51,500
more comfortable in your body your

3827
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:54,420
muscles are a little more relaxed

3828
02:34:51,500 --> 02:34:57,120
relaxed instead of just being clenched

3829
02:34:54,420 --> 02:34:59,818
and um and you're a little distracted

3830
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:01,620
from the THC too and you know you

3831
02:34:59,818 --> 02:35:03,719
haven't really changed the status of

3832
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:06,960
your body your body is still incredibly

3833
02:35:03,719 --> 02:35:09,179
uncomfortable and sick however

3834
02:35:06,959 --> 02:35:12,000
you can get a little bit of respite just

3835
02:35:09,180 --> 02:35:15,359
from the THC and the relaxation and the

3836
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:17,159
and the easing of your human also that

3837
02:35:15,359 --> 02:35:20,640
THC is very likely to give you an

3838
02:35:17,159 --> 02:35:22,439
appetite as well and as we know cancer

3839
02:35:20,639 --> 02:35:24,239
patients especially in chemo tend to

3840
02:35:22,439 --> 02:35:26,159
lose their appetite and we really don't

3841
02:35:24,239 --> 02:35:28,379
want you thinning down at the same time

3842
02:35:26,159 --> 02:35:30,299
we want to try to help you keep weight

3843
02:35:28,379 --> 02:35:32,039
on so that

3844
02:35:30,299 --> 02:35:35,519
um you know you don't slip into some

3845
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:38,460
kind of a wasting cycle because that's

3846
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:42,120
that's not usually a good sign if you

3847
02:35:38,459 --> 02:35:44,219
have access to thca that's the um that's

3848
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:47,340
THC that has not been heated or

3849
02:35:44,219 --> 02:35:50,579
decarboxylated thca is actually really

3850
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:53,700
effective in cancer patients for helping

3851
02:35:50,579 --> 02:35:58,439
rebuild appetite as well just in case

3852
02:35:53,700 --> 02:36:00,659
for you THC is not appetite forming I

3853
02:35:58,439 --> 02:36:04,200
try the acid form we get a lot of good

3854
02:36:00,659 --> 02:36:05,760
results with that here on the island

3855
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:09,120
um cyber since we started talking about

3856
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:10,978
it so that's been a real positive and so

3857
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:13,260
and the last thing for cancer symptom

3858
02:36:10,978 --> 02:36:16,799
relief is to just simply take as much

3859
02:36:13,260 --> 02:36:19,439
whole plant CBD oil as as you can afford

3860
02:36:16,799 --> 02:36:21,959
as we discussed earlier because your

3861
02:36:19,439 --> 02:36:23,939
body's endocannabinoid system is

3862
02:36:21,959 --> 02:36:26,099
probably a wreck from all of the

3863
02:36:23,939 --> 02:36:29,780
Pharmaceuticals and especially if you

3864
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:33,120
are taking chemo and your body's natural

3865
02:36:29,780 --> 02:36:35,700
balancing system is has been totally

3866
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:38,000
traumatized and so you're not properly

3867
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:40,260
making signaling molecules and and

3868
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:43,139
endocannabinoids and you could really

3869
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:46,680
benefit from dumping as much CBD into

3870
02:36:43,139 --> 02:36:48,539
your body as you can likely afford so um

3871
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:51,180
you know I guess I should put a top on

3872
02:36:48,540 --> 02:36:54,420
it I wouldn't put you know more than 400

3873
02:36:51,180 --> 02:36:56,880
milligrams of whole plant into

3874
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:58,559
um you know a day you probably your body

3875
02:36:56,879 --> 02:37:00,719
probably couldn't process more than that

3876
02:36:58,559 --> 02:37:03,299
and I actually don't have an opinion on

3877
02:37:00,719 --> 02:37:05,699
how much isolate is a maximum

3878
02:37:03,299 --> 02:37:07,920
um in especially for cancer I would

3879
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:10,319
really recommend that you use a whole

3880
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:13,620
plant preparation so that you're getting

3881
02:37:10,318 --> 02:37:16,559
all the secondary novel cannabinoids and

3882
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:18,300
the other synergistic components that

3883
02:37:16,559 --> 02:37:21,059
we're not entirely certain how they help

3884
02:37:18,299 --> 02:37:23,398
out yet like canaflavin and the others

3885
02:37:21,059 --> 02:37:26,579
for example

3886
02:37:23,398 --> 02:37:28,699
let's talk about migraines so migraines

3887
02:37:26,579 --> 02:37:32,280
um they're kind of low-hanging fruit

3888
02:37:28,700 --> 02:37:34,200
it either works or it doesn't but what

3889
02:37:32,280 --> 02:37:37,439
the dosage is is pretty basic and it's

3890
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:40,500
20 milligrams of whole plant CBD two

3891
02:37:37,439 --> 02:37:43,680
times a day minimum so you can take more

3892
02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:46,379
if you'd like of course but 20

3893
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:48,600
milligrams two times a day seems to work

3894
02:37:46,379 --> 02:37:51,239
pretty well for folks once people

3895
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:54,479
realize whether or not they are of the

3896
02:37:51,239 --> 02:37:57,299
20 of people who are kept awake at night

3897
02:37:54,478 --> 02:37:59,340
by CBD because of it activating the

3898
02:37:57,299 --> 02:38:01,019
body's housekeeping if you're not one of

3899
02:37:59,340 --> 02:38:03,299
those 20 go ahead and take it in the

3900
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:04,979
evening too which hopefully will act as

3901
02:38:03,299 --> 02:38:07,739
a prophylactic so you don't wake up in

3902
02:38:04,978 --> 02:38:10,079
the morning with a migraine but be aware

3903
02:38:07,739 --> 02:38:12,959
that if you are one of the 20 of people

3904
02:38:10,079 --> 02:38:14,398
that CBD keeps up at night

3905
02:38:12,959 --> 02:38:15,799
um you want to avoid that because that

3906
02:38:14,398 --> 02:38:19,079
probably will increase your likelihood

3907
02:38:15,799 --> 02:38:21,659
of actually waking up with a migraine

3908
02:38:19,079 --> 02:38:23,700
I also would have you consider a small

3909
02:38:21,659 --> 02:38:27,539
amount of THC for muscle relaxation

3910
02:38:23,700 --> 02:38:31,020
because we know that not only does a

3911
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:33,899
relaxation of the muscle sets help

3912
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:36,300
decrease the likelihood of migraines but

3913
02:38:33,898 --> 02:38:39,180
if you are a pretty severe migraine

3914
02:38:36,299 --> 02:38:41,459
patient your body's fear of having

3915
02:38:39,180 --> 02:38:44,939
another migraine and going through that

3916
02:38:41,459 --> 02:38:48,358
that cycle of pain and discomfort itself

3917
02:38:44,939 --> 02:38:51,180
can cause the body to

3918
02:38:48,359 --> 02:38:53,700
um constrict which in and of itself can

3919
02:38:51,180 --> 02:38:57,479
cause migraines and it just feels bad so

3920
02:38:53,700 --> 02:39:01,079
if you're not resistant to uh trying THC

3921
02:38:57,478 --> 02:39:05,898
taking five milligrams of a THC tincture

3922
02:39:01,079 --> 02:39:09,539
along with the 20 milligrams of CBD

3923
02:39:05,898 --> 02:39:12,420
will likely help you either move out of

3924
02:39:09,540 --> 02:39:14,939
a migraine or even better be a

3925
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:17,639
preventative I would also consider have

3926
02:39:14,939 --> 02:39:22,979
you consider micro dosing psilocybin

3927
02:39:17,639 --> 02:39:25,559
mushrooms at 0.1 milligrams taken 20

3928
02:39:22,978 --> 02:39:27,959
days a month if you'd like to learn more

3929
02:39:25,559 --> 02:39:29,939
about working with your migraine using

3930
02:39:27,959 --> 02:39:33,179
psilocybin mushrooms I encourage you to

3931
02:39:29,939 --> 02:39:35,880
listen to shapingfire episode 67 with Dr

3932
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:39,300
Russo where we talk all about treating

3933
02:39:35,879 --> 02:39:40,739
migraines with cannabis and psilocybin

3934
02:39:39,299 --> 02:39:42,059
mushrooms it's a good one

3935
02:39:40,739 --> 02:39:44,760
the next one we're going to talk about

3936
02:39:42,059 --> 02:39:45,779
is insomnia insomnia is incredibly

3937
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:48,540
common

3938
02:39:45,780 --> 02:39:49,920
um for me to hear about because so many

3939
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:52,319
people have got it for different reasons

3940
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:55,799
and it is actually pretty easy to treat

3941
02:39:52,318 --> 02:39:57,119
with um with cannabis the first question

3942
02:39:55,799 --> 02:39:58,739
I always ask people though when they

3943
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:00,840
tell me that they have insomnia is not

3944
02:39:58,739 --> 02:40:02,100
one that they generally like and that

3945
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:03,478
question is always

3946
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:05,700
um do you drink coffee in the morning

3947
02:40:03,478 --> 02:40:08,639
because that is the first thing to go

3948
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:12,840
the half-life of the drug we call

3949
02:40:08,639 --> 02:40:15,478
caffeine is 14 hours so by the time you

3950
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:18,659
are drinking tomorrow morning's coffee

3951
02:40:15,478 --> 02:40:20,938
you are still on yesterday's caffeine

3952
02:40:18,659 --> 02:40:24,600
that you took in the morning and if this

3953
02:40:20,939 --> 02:40:27,180
is continuing every day you're never not

3954
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:29,460
on caffeine which means that when you're

3955
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:31,800
trying to go to sleep at night you are

3956
02:40:29,459 --> 02:40:34,379
always fighting against a stimulant that

3957
02:40:31,799 --> 02:40:37,379
you took not only that morning but

3958
02:40:34,379 --> 02:40:39,539
yesterday morning as well and so that

3959
02:40:37,379 --> 02:40:41,579
would be the first place is to stop

3960
02:40:39,540 --> 02:40:42,960
drinking caffeine

3961
02:40:41,579 --> 02:40:44,459
um second I would ask them what they

3962
02:40:42,959 --> 02:40:46,259
think their source of their insomnia

3963
02:40:44,459 --> 02:40:48,959
what's the flavor

3964
02:40:46,260 --> 02:40:51,478
um insomnia tends to fall into two

3965
02:40:48,959 --> 02:40:53,699
categories one being some sort of

3966
02:40:51,478 --> 02:40:56,099
discomfort or pain and then the other

3967
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:59,460
sort being some sort of anxiety or

3968
02:40:56,100 --> 02:41:02,399
rumination and then I would suggest for

3969
02:40:59,459 --> 02:41:04,679
them solutions for the pain or the

3970
02:41:02,398 --> 02:41:07,920
anxiety rumination

3971
02:41:04,680 --> 02:41:11,280
um but oddly they do tend to be both the

3972
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:14,299
same cannabis prescription which is five

3973
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:17,520
to ten milligrams of an Indica tincture

3974
02:41:14,299 --> 02:41:20,398
made using purple flowering cannabis

3975
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:22,859
plants now I know that the terms sativa

3976
02:41:20,398 --> 02:41:25,139
and indica are Antiquated but people are

3977
02:41:22,859 --> 02:41:28,020
still using them and they can be helpful

3978
02:41:25,139 --> 02:41:30,599
when going to you know a licensed store

3979
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:33,079
and talking with a bud tender but what

3980
02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:36,780
we're looking for are tinctures

3981
02:41:33,079 --> 02:41:39,719
preferably made from plants from the you

3982
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:42,859
know Afghanistan Pakistan region that

3983
02:41:39,719 --> 02:41:46,679
are purple because these plants are

3984
02:41:42,859 --> 02:41:48,059
heavily narcotic and lethargic and

3985
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:51,239
that's what we want to do right we want

3986
02:41:48,059 --> 02:41:53,398
to cause drowsiness and we want to cause

3987
02:41:51,239 --> 02:41:55,020
muscle relaxation and we want to slow

3988
02:41:53,398 --> 02:41:57,478
you down and make you feel a little

3989
02:41:55,020 --> 02:41:59,280
dreamy and then put you to sleep also

3990
02:41:57,478 --> 02:42:01,679
these plants these purple flowering

3991
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:04,800
cannabis plants they're usually packed

3992
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:07,920
with the terpen the terpenes miracine

3993
02:42:04,799 --> 02:42:11,099
and lunolool which also help you feel

3994
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:12,898
drowsy and have you go to sleep

3995
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:15,180
um specifically if the insomnia is

3996
02:42:12,898 --> 02:42:18,119
caused by anxiety and rumination it

3997
02:42:15,180 --> 02:42:21,420
would be really great to add some CBG

3998
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:23,040
tincture to that as well and if the

3999
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:23,840
person that you're working with or

4000
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:27,300
yourself

4001
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:30,000
is THC intolerant either on principle or

4002
02:42:27,299 --> 02:42:33,779
or they're sensitive to it you can just

4003
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:37,559
give them CBG CBG helps with both pain

4004
02:42:33,780 --> 02:42:40,020
and anxiety rumination and so taking

4005
02:42:37,559 --> 02:42:44,039
between 10 milligrams and 20 milligrams

4006
02:42:40,020 --> 02:42:46,979
of CBG for insomnia is very effective

4007
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:50,780
for folks especially if they are very

4008
02:42:46,978 --> 02:42:53,519
much not interested in taking THC

4009
02:42:50,780 --> 02:42:57,060
depression depression would be 20

4010
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:58,560
milligrams two times a day of CBD where

4011
02:42:57,059 --> 02:43:00,539
you're taking that because your goal is

4012
02:42:58,559 --> 02:43:04,859
to build up the endocannabinoid system

4013
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:06,840
and to help regulate the brain chemistry

4014
02:43:04,859 --> 02:43:09,000
um this is something that you want to do

4015
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:10,260
long term right CBD is not something

4016
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:12,840
that you're just going to take Monday

4017
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:15,239
and then Thursday and then Sunday no no

4018
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:17,460
you want to take CBD every day because

4019
02:43:15,239 --> 02:43:20,219
the benefits the primary benefits come

4020
02:43:17,459 --> 02:43:22,978
from building up your endocannabinoid

4021
02:43:20,219 --> 02:43:25,318
system and making it Burly so it can do

4022
02:43:22,978 --> 02:43:28,978
its job regulating your body's systems

4023
02:43:25,318 --> 02:43:31,019
so that would be 20 milligrams two times

4024
02:43:28,978 --> 02:43:33,779
a day three times if you can take it in

4025
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:36,000
the evening of CBD

4026
02:43:33,780 --> 02:43:37,739
and also to put yourself in a good mood

4027
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:39,420
and make things a little more tolerable

4028
02:43:37,739 --> 02:43:41,639
while you're trying to change yourself

4029
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:43,739
systemically go ahead and try to get

4030
02:43:41,639 --> 02:43:46,559
your hands on some CBG tincture or oil

4031
02:43:43,739 --> 02:43:48,659
as well and take 10 milligrams of that

4032
02:43:46,559 --> 02:43:52,019
twice a day in the morning and then

4033
02:43:48,659 --> 02:43:54,600
after lunch that's CBG my goodness is it

4034
02:43:52,020 --> 02:43:56,579
an effective anti-anxiety and it just

4035
02:43:54,600 --> 02:43:59,220
makes things feel a little better and

4036
02:43:56,579 --> 02:44:02,520
the confidence that it brings really

4037
02:43:59,219 --> 02:44:04,739
helps even out the depression Vibes of

4038
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:06,060
hopelessness

4039
02:44:04,739 --> 02:44:08,039
and then I would also recommend

4040
02:44:06,059 --> 02:44:11,219
microdosing psilocybin

4041
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:13,859
micro dosing psilocybin really helps

4042
02:44:11,219 --> 02:44:16,978
improve your neural network and pull you

4043
02:44:13,859 --> 02:44:18,720
out of a funk there's lots of research

4044
02:44:16,978 --> 02:44:21,599
on it to support it and I encourage you

4045
02:44:18,719 --> 02:44:25,019
to check out the the micro dose

4046
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:26,159
psilocybin episodes on shaping fire

4047
02:44:25,020 --> 02:44:28,640
and the last one we're going to talk

4048
02:44:26,159 --> 02:44:31,318
about here is neurodivergent support

4049
02:44:28,639 --> 02:44:34,619
more and more people especially during

4050
02:44:31,318 --> 02:44:37,318
quarantine when our lives got less

4051
02:44:34,620 --> 02:44:40,579
thrilling and we were creating less

4052
02:44:37,318 --> 02:44:43,559
dopamine from having relatively boring

4053
02:44:40,579 --> 02:44:46,139
quarantined lives a lot of people

4054
02:44:43,559 --> 02:44:48,898
realized that they have some flavor of

4055
02:44:46,139 --> 02:44:51,719
neurodivergence and while you figure

4056
02:44:48,898 --> 02:44:53,659
that out by doing your reading and

4057
02:44:51,719 --> 02:44:56,459
checking out the

4058
02:44:53,659 --> 02:44:59,818
neurodivergent community on Tick Tock I

4059
02:44:56,459 --> 02:45:01,438
also recommend these as potential things

4060
02:44:59,818 --> 02:45:04,199
to help you get through as you figure

4061
02:45:01,439 --> 02:45:07,020
out the best combination for you 40

4062
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:09,659
milligrams of CBD whole plant oil two

4063
02:45:07,020 --> 02:45:11,220
times a day this is of course because we

4064
02:45:09,659 --> 02:45:13,859
want to build up that endocannabinoid

4065
02:45:11,219 --> 02:45:16,318
system and we want to give our brain as

4066
02:45:13,859 --> 02:45:19,200
many signaling molecules as it can to do

4067
02:45:16,318 --> 02:45:21,420
its job because neurodivergent brains

4068
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:23,700
they are running hotter and faster than

4069
02:45:21,420 --> 02:45:25,680
other people's brains and they need

4070
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:28,500
intentional support

4071
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:30,180
um you're not driving a you know a

4072
02:45:28,500 --> 02:45:32,579
regular car like everybody else you're

4073
02:45:30,180 --> 02:45:34,920
driving a Formula One and Formula One

4074
02:45:32,579 --> 02:45:38,398
cars they need specialty tires specialty

4075
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:39,478
oils specialty fluids and so do you my

4076
02:45:38,398 --> 02:45:42,420
friend

4077
02:45:39,478 --> 02:45:44,219
um it was also helpful to you know keep

4078
02:45:42,420 --> 02:45:47,579
things in a good perspective by

4079
02:45:44,219 --> 02:45:50,159
supplementing with CBG 10 milligrams two

4080
02:45:47,579 --> 02:45:51,680
times a day and and the reason is just

4081
02:45:50,159 --> 02:45:54,299
simply It's hard out there for

4082
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:56,520
neurodivergent folks this world was not

4083
02:45:54,299 --> 02:45:58,739
designed for the neurodivergent brain

4084
02:45:56,520 --> 02:46:01,560
and that can get incredibly frustrating

4085
02:45:58,739 --> 02:46:03,719
and so taking some CBG giving you that

4086
02:46:01,559 --> 02:46:05,398
that confidence and a feeling that

4087
02:46:03,719 --> 02:46:07,199
you've got the resources to make it work

4088
02:46:05,398 --> 02:46:10,559
it can really make your days more

4089
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:13,020
tolerable I'd also recommend 200

4090
02:46:10,559 --> 02:46:16,559
milligrams of l-theanine now this is not

4091
02:46:13,020 --> 02:46:18,600
a cannabis product that's for sure but I

4092
02:46:16,559 --> 02:46:23,100
know that neurodivergent folks who run

4093
02:46:18,600 --> 02:46:26,399
hot and anxious find that l-theanine 200

4094
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:29,159
milligrams of it really really evens out

4095
02:46:26,398 --> 02:46:31,318
the spiky parts of the day the days that

4096
02:46:29,159 --> 02:46:32,700
where you get over stimulated and or

4097
02:46:31,318 --> 02:46:35,579
harshed out

4098
02:46:32,700 --> 02:46:38,880
from uh from you know feeling over

4099
02:46:35,579 --> 02:46:40,500
sensory inputted l-theanine does a

4100
02:46:38,879 --> 02:46:42,539
really great job taking out the

4101
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:44,040
scratchiness of your day

4102
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:46,740
and if you happen to be a person that's

4103
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:49,319
into THC well you know having some THC

4104
02:46:46,739 --> 02:46:51,539
tincture just to make you two feel more

4105
02:46:49,318 --> 02:46:54,719
comfortable in your body that can often

4106
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:58,620
feel strange to you feel free to add you

4107
02:46:54,719 --> 02:47:00,299
know five to ten milligrams of THC as

4108
02:46:58,620 --> 02:47:02,939
you wish

4109
02:47:00,299 --> 02:47:07,079
and good luck

4110
02:47:02,939 --> 02:47:09,720
so these these uh these six areas that I

4111
02:47:07,079 --> 02:47:13,379
just you know swiftly went through how I

4112
02:47:09,719 --> 02:47:15,539
would think through dosing suggestions

4113
02:47:13,379 --> 02:47:17,099
I I did this not because you know I

4114
02:47:15,540 --> 02:47:19,560
can't go through everything all the

4115
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:21,000
issues that everybody has but the idea

4116
02:47:19,559 --> 02:47:23,100
is I wanted to give you a couple

4117
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:26,459
pictures a couple examples of how you

4118
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:29,280
can stack different uh cannabis

4119
02:47:26,459 --> 02:47:31,438
different cannabinoids along with

4120
02:47:29,280 --> 02:47:33,000
different entheogens like psilocybin

4121
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:35,760
mushrooms

4122
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:38,159
um along with occasional you know herbal

4123
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:39,780
supplements like l-theanine and some

4124
02:47:38,159 --> 02:47:42,659
common sense like perhaps don't drink

4125
02:47:39,780 --> 02:47:43,500
coffee if you're have insomnia

4126
02:47:42,659 --> 02:47:45,719
um

4127
02:47:43,500 --> 02:47:48,059
so that you can you know figure out a

4128
02:47:45,719 --> 02:47:49,260
stack for yourself that meets your needs

4129
02:47:48,059 --> 02:47:51,898
um you don't have to do it the way other

4130
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:55,020
people do individualized medicine is a

4131
02:47:51,898 --> 02:47:57,420
thing and your body is unique and so um

4132
02:47:55,020 --> 02:48:00,060
keep a journal figure out what works for

4133
02:47:57,420 --> 02:48:02,219
you and and don't let your family or

4134
02:48:00,059 --> 02:48:04,379
doctors push you around

4135
02:48:02,219 --> 02:48:07,739
um I am a strong advocate of patients

4136
02:48:04,379 --> 02:48:10,799
rights as as everybody knows especially

4137
02:48:07,739 --> 02:48:14,100
um cannabis patient self-sufficiency

4138
02:48:10,799 --> 02:48:16,199
so it's your body take notes and and

4139
02:48:14,100 --> 02:48:17,939
learn what's best for you

4140
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:19,859

4141
02:48:17,939 --> 02:48:21,059
