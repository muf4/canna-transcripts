1
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,720
all right cool so real thank you so much

2
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,359
for having us on the farm today you know

3
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,038
the property is so beautiful and you

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,610
know as everybody can see you know

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,160
you're on a mountaintop with 360 degree

6
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,829
views what a great place to make a farm

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,319
yeah and yet when you got here it was

8
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:41,119
not in good shape you know old forested

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,780
property with lots of heavy machinery

10
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,729
and yet you breathed life into it so so

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,000
let's start there what is it that you

12
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:51,049
did to help restore and regenerate the

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,869
soil on the property

14
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:58,218
yeah the areas that we were farming had

15
00:00:53,869 --> 00:01:00,500
been gone had been logged and I've been

16
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,770
degraded by big machinery like you said

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,019
so they were hard pack so the soil was

18
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,380
really like dried out when you kind of

19
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:11,090
runt when you run machine over and

20
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:15,289
destroy all the biology in an area and

21
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:17,600
then it becomes hard the soil pores

22
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:23,000
closed down it doesn't absorb water and

23
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:25,368
so how to bring that that from that

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,259
state back into a biological state I

25
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:29,420
mean you really need to sink carbon and

26
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:32,750
you really need to sink biology back

27
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,239
into the dirt so first is we designated

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,349
our AG zones and we started digging

29
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:41,300
trenches not deep trenches but like 2 3

30
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:43,700
feet in some areas some areas of where

31
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:47,118
it was much more stable deeper and we

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,569
started burying our forestry products

33
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:54,409
are our forestry thinnings from wildfire

34
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:57,500
protection back into that those degraded

35
00:01:54,409 --> 00:02:00,950
areas and then we would layer the hard

36
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,049
pack with compost with forests thinnings

37
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,170
with woodchips with any kind of

38
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:10,128
biological with any kind of plant but

39
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:12,770
you can find right and develop these

40
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:15,979
lasagna layers which now are like you

41
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:21,349
know quite deep and spongy and absorb

42
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:23,329
water and really like I like the idea

43
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:25,878
that you know obviously there's wildfire

44
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,099
issue here but it just seems rather

45
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:31,310
intuitive to be able to use all of the

46
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:33,469
the forest stuff and the tree fall and

47
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,650
all this to put it to good use

48
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:38,960
rebuilding the soil in the same

49
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:41,090
bioregion which also then increases the

50
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,129
safety of the farm itself and and your

51
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,189
neighbors honestly I mean in

52
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:48,019
permaculture stacking functions and so I

53
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:51,020
wouldn't I wasn't even thinking this way

54
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,420
years ago and you know I would import or

55
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,090
buy soil from the trucks and plastic

56
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:58,399
bags and they'd have to be shipped in

57
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:02,420
harvested keep my hogs where it's like

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,430
totally not sustainable practices and

59
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,229
the more I learned the more I realized

60
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,409
that all the resources I need to grow

61
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:12,319
amazing products and cannabis on my farm

62
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:16,189
are already here it's like biological

63
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,829
diversity in a forest with IMO's you

64
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:21,379
know indigenous microorganisms with Ray

65
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:24,140
Niall chips with the different you

66
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:28,240
shaniyah hanging from the oak leaves the

67
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:31,458
herbs the fungus the grasses it's all

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,810
already existing and that diversity is

69
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:39,680
the strength of a system a biological

70
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:43,159
system so just kind of mimicking my 72

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,790
acres in my garden areas and trying to

72
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:50,659
mimic the productivity of a forest

73
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:53,150
system I love the fact too that you

74
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:55,069
didn't bring in all of the soil products

75
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,519
you know we talk a lot on shaping fire

76
00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:01,609
about bio regionalism of microorganisms

77
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,860
right so you might have a microbe from

78
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,450
Alaska that's used to an entirely

79
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,489
different environment so it does great

80
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:11,810
in Alaska but it doesn't do great here

81
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:14,269
right but by by wildcrafting your inputs

82
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,639
here on your property you're really just

83
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:20,120
moving the microbes around on your

84
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,339
property and so they're they're used to

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,689
thriving in in your environment and so

86
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:26,689
you don't have to like move all this

87
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:28,850
biology here have it crash and then

88
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:30,949
rebuild it you're you're skipping you

89
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,800
know that die-off step by using all of

90
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:36,319
your own forested stuff for I mean for

91
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,540
instance like we do the forest thing

92
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,459
then we would chip and we collect those

93
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:44,360
wood chips and we line all our paths

94
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:46,229
with the wood chips and and then over

95
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,960
winter the mike

96
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,750
organisms that were already in this area

97
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,029
are growing in our paths and so when we

98
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,569
brew a tea now we just go on our paths

99
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:59,279
and we dig up the white molds and and

100
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:03,990
the microorganisms in those paths and

101
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:06,899
just add it to the tea and it's changes

102
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,889
the smell of the tea it really like it

103
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,539
adds a lot of strength to the systems

104
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,769
that are already in place what a great

105
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,390
thing to be able to do I mean like I

106
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:18,299
make I brew tea too but you know I'm

107
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,069
using this person or that person's blend

108
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,509
right which I purchased which you know

109
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,310
since you know I live on Vashon Island

110
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,889
but you know I live really close to

111
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,829
Seattle so it's kind of rural City right

112
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:31,169
but you're very much out here and so

113
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:33,359
you're being able to target the specific

114
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,060
microbes you want just by producing them

115
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,639
on the island and then using the brewing

116
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,160
of the tea to essentially super

117
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,289
concentrate them and then feed them back

118
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,050
to themselves I love that I don't know

119
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm not a scientist but I just by

120
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,829
experience it's working really well well

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,329
from the plants that I mean we're early

122
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:53,459
in the season here but the plants that I

123
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,109
saw we're already jumping ahead that you

124
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,519
know nobody was looked like they were

125
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,770
shocked at all from being transplanted

126
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:02,339
everybody's like you know up and going

127
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:03,449
appropriately for this time of year one

128
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,729
of the things that I found interesting

129
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,189
was you know I'll - are some farms and

130
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,280
they'll use you know some wood chip

131
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:16,860
mulch or or they might have a Google or

132
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:19,439
more but you have deployed wood and

133
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,170
parts of tree like everywhere it is

134
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,069
clearly the the number one input that

135
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:29,810
I've experienced from touring today and

136
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:32,939
I would think that that has to do with -

137
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,680
for two reasons number one you live in a

138
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,959
forest and so it's a resource you've got

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,530
a lot of but also you talked a lot about

140
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,299
preserving water here and and so you

141
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:45,989
really seem to be using that wood for

142
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,160
it's it's it's it's sponge capabilities

143
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,350
why do you tell us a little bit about

144
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,170
that because water is clearly so dire

145
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:56,550
here yeah I mean just like I was saying

146
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:59,999
it's a can the earth absorb rain and

147
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,838
where does it go once it's absorbed how

148
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:06,990
what trees are thriving and where's the

149
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:11,870
runoff going and so getting ground cover

150
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:16,379
on on every area that I can it's like

151
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,059
it's it starts microbiology going so

152
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:22,050
quick I mean any place that I put

153
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:24,539
woodchips worms show up within a month

154
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,908
or two and they're like I put wood chips

155
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:29,550
on the fruit trees and they're thriving

156
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:33,058
and they're retaining water and it just

157
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:35,610
holds it so building swales and then

158
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:39,509
laying wood chips in the Swale and then

159
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:44,249
and even and then wood chipping just any

160
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:46,559
in any area that is open is it's gonna

161
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:48,899
change the biology of the soil the soil

162
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:50,520
starts opening up because of the life

163
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,559
that it brings and there's different

164
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,478
wood chips like the hardy or wood from

165
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:57,659
the tree it's going to take a lot longer

166
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,128
to to to break down verses the rainy

167
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:02,759
ellipse from the leaves and the branches

168
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:06,209
is almost you know available much

169
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,819
quicker is remiel a tree species no it's

170
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:12,180
just the smaller branches so it's the

171
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,800
fingers the outer edges of the new

172
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,110
growth right on and it's more

173
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,728
biologically active and ready it's you

174
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,199
know it's softer wood that's why people

175
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:20,818
I guess use the green parts when they're

176
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,310
gonna make fermentation or something

177
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:27,689
right probably more biologically active

178
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:31,468
yeah and we try to bury all all types of

179
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:32,759
stuff into our who-ville's just then we

180
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,528
have stuff that's breaking down a little

181
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,860
slower and a lot of people are worried

182
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:40,500
about the nitrogen like pulling nitrogen

183
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,800
out of your plants but there's so if you

184
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,578
get the biology right and you get living

185
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:50,698
soils active it's breaking down and

186
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:52,588
producing at the same time so I don't I

187
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:55,318
think that's a key to the making the

188
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:58,199
jump from I'm adding nutrients to feed

189
00:08:55,318 --> 00:09:00,179
my plant versus us being soil farmers

190
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:02,250
right and we're actually trying to you

191
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,259
know keep a healthy rhizosphere and so

192
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,509
long as we keep the soil healthy the

193
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,659
plant will be fine right

194
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:11,490
I mean try not used to it here use the

195
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:14,549
boring nutrients on it because it meets

196
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,940
nitrogen and I'm used that's how I grew

197
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,859
up

198
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,470
it's like this plant needs nitrogen but

199
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,019
that's because we were buying soil that

200
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,879
everything was spent right and then

201
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,159
there was no worms in your bag soil

202
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,948
there was no you know you could open up

203
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,458
the soil here and there's so many bugs

204
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:34,198
and different things happening that from

205
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:37,919
what I've learned from Elaine Ingram and

206
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:40,620
dragonfly earth medicine cohorts is that

207
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,819
it's just pulling nutrient to pull it

208
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,000
out it's like that

209
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,680
I guess there's different different

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,370
metaphors for it but like the

211
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:52,528
supermarket like you know there's all

212
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,139
these products into the supermarket but

213
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:57,689
until you have a living system the doors

214
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,730
are shut you open the doors and then all

215
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,070
of a sudden you're like whoa those are

216
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,870
already in there and with your you know

217
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,600
we've walked this property for a while

218
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,179
today and just like the the insects that

219
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,250
we're hearing right now as you move in

220
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:14,729
different height of your property and

221
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,940
then you're more AG land versus you're

222
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,019
more hard-packed like you know housing

223
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,269
areas and where you keep your equipment

224
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,610
we're actually running into different

225
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:25,980
sounds it's a melody of different types

226
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,009
of beetles and crickets and whatever you

227
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,949
have up here you know that kind of

228
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:34,740
diversity you want to model that in the

229
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:36,990
soil just as much right yeah I mean

230
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,350
there there's different systems like the

231
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:42,930
who goes down below had much more forest

232
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,659
products in them than this stuff up this

233
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:48,359
has more annual and more we just worked

234
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:51,809
this more from our compost from our

235
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,089
house and stuff like that um but there

236
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:56,189
are micro climates it's like warmer on

237
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:59,040
that side we're kind of like in bimbo

238
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,839
there's a river on the north of us and a

239
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:05,129
river on the southwest of us so we're

240
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,630
this island farm kind of if you if

241
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:08,338
you're driving down the freeway you see

242
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:10,259
just the mountain that we're on and

243
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,839
we're literally the whole top of this

244
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:15,838
island so we're kind of have these crazy

245
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,590
swirling wind patterns and a lot of

246
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,390
different things going on

247
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,940
one of the things that we had talked

248
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:25,659
about earlier was you know the need to

249
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,700
to slow down the water that's passing by

250
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:29,439
because you know for a lot of folks who

251
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,990
are who are lower down the mountain

252
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,089
there are there's there there's there's

253
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,830
Springs and there's rainfall and one way

254
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:38,470
or another the water comes down the

255
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:41,560
mountain and and different people can

256
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:44,620
use it but you know not only are you at

257
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,449
the top of the mountain but regulations

258
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,039
in California have changed a lot now so

259
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,200
that so that most people can't use

260
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,969
naturally occurring Springs on their

261
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,950
property or just above their property

262
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,519
and for you there is no just above your

263
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,770
property right so um so if you would

264
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,120
explain a little bit about how you are

265
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:06,669
trying to sink the water here instead of

266
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,250
letting any of it kind of move on past

267
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:11,559
you yeah I mean it's a challenge like

268
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,919
this is an ideal like if you're studying

269
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:17,588
land that's productive the top of the

270
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:20,709
mountain would not be the spot you would

271
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,990
want because usually silt would run off

272
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,060
the mountain and gather in the valleys

273
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,370
and most AG lands in the valleys and

274
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:29,679
water starts pouring out of the side of

275
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,990
the hill but we're at the top of the

276
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,889
hill luckily we have 72 acres and we

277
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,389
have a whole northern watershed area to

278
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:40,389
it for our domestic use

279
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:43,269
but cannabis regulations make us store

280
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:45,490
everything and only use rain catchment

281
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:47,879
so we've developed a series of three

282
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,980
ponds where all of our greenhouses

283
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,809
follow the roof catchment from our

284
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,970
greenhouses and our sheds and and my

285
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:56,949
father's house all flow into those and

286
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:01,750
then we siphon off that into our

287
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:05,410
reservoir so we do have like 700,000

288
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:09,159
gallons of rain catchment but more than

289
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:12,458
that is even on this space and this is

290
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:15,719
about six acres of top of the hill and

291
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:19,750
which it which has hills and flows

292
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:24,759
there's so many things we can do to just

293
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:28,179
soar to sink to divert to capture water

294
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,309
on this six acres as much as possible

295
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:31,029
and we haven't really done as much as we

296
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,909
can

297
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:36,299
there's still roads and we still do get

298
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:38,500
runoff but I'm much better than we were

299
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:40,859
so let's talk about a couple of those

300
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,360
strategies right because I think that

301
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,120
not only do a lot of different kinds of

302
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,000
farmers have to be creative when it

303
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,370
comes to creating and preserving water

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,340
on their property but also you know as

305
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,580
as everybody starts to get drier waters

306
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,019
having come more valuable what are the

307
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,360
couple of the strategies that you've

308
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:03,879
used on the property - to sink the water

309
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,230
and to keep it here I know and I'll get

310
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,149
you started but one that I thought that

311
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,560
was especially cool was as we were

312
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,019
walking down the road you're like oh

313
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,149
we're gonna we're gonna put catchment to

314
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,889
spread the natural road run off to the

315
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:16,299
side so why do you start there and then

316
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,100
this kind of tell us anything else say

317
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:21,579
that that along those lines

318
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:25,480
yeah like Road is a perfect example of

319
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,940
something that is that creates a runoff

320
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,100
like you wouldn't find a road in a

321
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,550
forest and so all the water that falls

322
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:37,360
around a tree is like I said the pores

323
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:39,519
in a in a forest all the mulch is there

324
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,550
the wood chips are there the grass and

325
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,649
all those soil pores are open whereas a

326
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:48,459
road we're driving on it we've killed

327
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:50,709
all the biology there steep in parts and

328
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,839
so the water just runs downhill

329
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:55,300
and so Department of Fish and Wildlife

330
00:14:52,839 --> 00:15:00,040
and all the regulations have forced us

331
00:14:55,299 --> 00:15:02,139
farmers to really limit rove road runoff

332
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,569
and which has been an amazing thing I

333
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,759
mean it's good very positive regulate

334
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,410
mean yeah the politics are a little

335
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,838
damaging on the other side but the

336
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:13,449
regulations I totally agree on and so

337
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,480
we've created swales in all of our roads

338
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:19,089
every you know forty to sixty feet so

339
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,389
all the road runoff will stop across the

340
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,610
road and ditch into the forest and so

341
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:26,529
our whole road system all the way down

342
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,620
to the bottom last summer we created

343
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:32,829
these swale systems so there's no more

344
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:36,929
like really intense Road Road ditching

345
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:41,020
it's made much less work for me in that

346
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:44,009
you know accounting for that where every

347
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:47,129
ounce of that water is going to go

348
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:49,980
with the Swale systems really does stop

349
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:52,830
road erosion and the forest around there

350
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,750
is now capturing wherever that pitches

351
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:57,480
off into the forest that's gonna capture

352
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,759
that other than that it's like I was

353
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,649
saying like just watch it and the rent

354
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,139
and the rainstorms see where the water

355
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:05,159
is and see where there's little zones

356
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,289
where maybe you can make a

357
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:11,120
water-retention it's not like building

358
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:13,469
ponds but building water retention zones

359
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,629
where you're not you're not trying to

360
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:19,950
store a lot of water but you're using

361
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:24,659
your land as the storage so if you just

362
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:26,670
create a little little like Swale that

363
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,429
looks like a horseshoe and then water

364
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:32,399
just sits there for a day or two and

365
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:34,859
then sinks in you've created a whole

366
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:41,610
bunch more water retention for

367
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:44,279
everything under that zone you um you

368
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,720
seem to really mean your dad lives here

369
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,149
right and so he's got this gorgeous

370
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,120
garden right bursting with color and

371
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:52,709
also you know you're really in the poly

372
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,519
culture right so you've got you've got

373
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:59,070
plants alongside and inside your beds

374
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,230
you've got all sorts of you know herbal

375
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,900
medicine botanicals you know just like

376
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,819
you know lining your beds lining the

377
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,920
road just kind of everywhere it would

378
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:11,639
seem to me that all these additional

379
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,940
plantings you know just act as a big

380
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,300
sponge and create this freeway down for

381
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,830
the for the water that you hold it tell

382
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:22,559
me a little bit about like the amount of

383
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,019
effort it was for you to add all this

384
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,139
poly culture because you know anybody

385
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:29,490
who's probably following this channel

386
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:32,100
realizes that we're all like you know

387
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,920
you know Pro poly culture and growing

388
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,949
cannabis all on its own monocultures is

389
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,880
just like not really all that positive

390
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,860
but a lot of people think that they

391
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,230
can't do it because it's like it takes

392
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:46,199
so much effort just to grow the cannabis

393
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,240
that I don't have enough time to do to

394
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,850
do all these other plantings and yet

395
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,130
you've got them everywhere so so so you

396
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:56,189
know how much labor did that add to your

397
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,020
season to be able to you know add this

398
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,009
crop

399
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:03,259
variety but also water sinks yeah I mean

400
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:06,140
I can't I couldn't do it alone so having

401
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:09,079
a team is very important sure and a team

402
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,940
that knows like I'm not fully I'm not an

403
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,789
herbalist or I'm I don't know all the

404
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,650
plant varieties so we have a team and we

405
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:17,539
talk about it we sit around the fire we

406
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,310
say hey what if we did this what if we

407
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:21,529
did that that's important but I think

408
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:24,259
that what I've learned is timing is

409
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:27,440
everything so as soon as I cut my

410
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:29,900
cannabis I'm throwing out cover crop and

411
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,880
then if I cover you know in the early

412
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,860
spring I'm throwing wildflower seed I

413
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,770
love that's like my favorite job is to

414
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:39,079
literally just have a bucket and go out

415
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:42,109
at the right time judging on what

416
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,779
weather and just throw seed so I just

417
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:47,509
try to throw seed everywhere and then I

418
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:50,779
do I have a nursery where I propagate

419
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:53,839
you know plants and plugging them in

420
00:18:50,779 --> 00:19:00,710
here and there on the edges it's fun

421
00:18:53,839 --> 00:19:02,990
it's not really extra labor but I mean

422
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,360
it's a learning curve so I've definitely

423
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,190
killed a lot of plants by putting them

424
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:11,779
at the wrong time I think timing is the

425
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:13,250
biggest learning curve on that yeah one

426
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:14,930
of the things I thought was cool so the

427
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,670
when you're referring to this nursery

428
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,670
you're talking about the one made out of

429
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,050
all of reclaimed materials right yeah so

430
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:24,050
I thought that was pretty cool too

431
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:25,430
because you know I I can see this theme

432
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:27,549
kind of running throughout your life

433
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:30,710
you're all like all right how diverse

434
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:32,629
how can I bring diversity as a solution

435
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,900
to each of these challenges that I've

436
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:39,010
got and how can I expand the

437
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:43,730
productivity of my land

438
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:46,940
trying to keep my my resource footprint

439
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,259
small and using what's here right and so

440
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,850
when we saw your nursery I mean it was

441
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:51,140
cool to go in and to see all the healthy

442
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:53,299
plants rocking along and then you're

443
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,040
like oh yeah this was from somewhere

444
00:19:53,299 --> 00:20:00,559
else this was from somewhere else and

445
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:03,649
you know and you know G to find that it

446
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,809
was challenging to source the

447
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,750
second-hand material and so it actually

448
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:09,609
made it more laborious or did you find

449
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,970
that actually when

450
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:15,399
you shift your expectations to

451
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:19,529
reclaiming stuff that it just kind of is

452
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,759
everywhere yeah the latter bladders like

453
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:24,099
there's resources everywhere and

454
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:27,670
adjusting your designed to fit your

455
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:29,980
resources is part of that plan like you

456
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:34,509
might want a fully framed metal

457
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,620
greenhouse but this has actually worked

458
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:39,220
much better

459
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:41,649
we have proclaimed glass from I think

460
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,808
good guy in Eureka had a whole pile of

461
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,600
glass I still have like 50 sheets of it

462
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:49,178
um so we made glass windows out of that

463
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:52,719
and all the Redwood was from an old barn

464
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:55,298
and over in West Haven you know by the

465
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,610
coast and it was just rotting in the

466
00:20:55,298 --> 00:21:00,190
ground so we picked that up for a huge

467
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:03,009
like almost a whole barn for like three

468
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,320
grand so we have this huge stack of

469
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:07,058
old-growth redwood just keep using it

470
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,939
and we're still using it like four years

471
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:13,240
later I like that idea you've got of not

472
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:16,058
forcing the solution to necessarily be

473
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,730
not forcing the solution to the problem

474
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:21,639
or to the challenge to be the one that

475
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,740
you expect it to be but instead kind of

476
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,380
hold space with the challenge and then

477
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,179
look around you for for what your

478
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,870
natural environment might suggest as a

479
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:33,720
solution I can learn from that myself I

480
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:36,819
mean we all good right it's like

481
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,029
permaculture or its life it's like if

482
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:42,189
you if you are attentive to what's in

483
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:46,779
front of you and you're in the moment

484
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,190
then ideas just flow and you know I'd

485
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:50,619
like to be well planned but like

486
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,558
gardening it's like you have to the best

487
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:56,859
gardening tool is farmer shadow so just

488
00:21:53,558 --> 00:22:00,009
showing up up here and being here these

489
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:02,168
designs come a guy I've always wanted to

490
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:04,960
have like a full scale permaculture plan

491
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:07,720
for my whole land and then I do that and

492
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,419
then we start driving and talking and we

493
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,839
end up doing something different and I

494
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:16,179
think it's been much more creative I

495
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,490
think both are important because then

496
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:21,460
the planning process

497
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:24,940
brings in more thoughtful solutions and

498
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:28,990
you can go back to that so but forcing

499
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:31,090
stuff well one thing I've learned from

500
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,430
talking to permaculture people - is that

501
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:35,379
your permaculture plan I mean unless

502
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,090
you're doing it for a client right but

503
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,860
really a permaculture plan is never

504
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,659
finished because as soon as you're done

505
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,309
you're like alright this is perfect and

506
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,440
then you learn some more stuff and

507
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:46,779
you're like all right you're changing

508
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,350
things and so I think that's why people

509
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:53,170
enjoy living like you're living is

510
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:55,750
because it's a it's an active exercise

511
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,029
in artistry with nature right it's like

512
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,170
constant evolving and changing and as

513
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:01,960
soon as you make your map you're gonna

514
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:04,750
be changing your map probably yeah yeah

515
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:08,620
it's ever-changing I mean you get out

516
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,809
here and you get inspired where my dad

517
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:12,699
is a carpenter so he just ends up

518
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:16,179
building little sheds all over he built

519
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:20,140
this little like collective kitchen for

520
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:22,630
the workers on a trailer or Lizzie has

521
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:26,050
his girlfriend she's just like a wild

522
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:28,870
gardener so she sees a place that needs

523
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:31,119
a rose or a plant she'll just stick rose

524
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:34,659
in the forest somewhere you know it's

525
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,669
like you know you I mean part of it you

526
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,070
have to like be productive and stay in

527
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,080
business which is I guess that's my job

528
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:42,609
right and everybody else just kind of

529
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:46,240
you know but everyone else in the family

530
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:48,759
has much more like creative freedom like

531
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,890
to think that way I think that interplay

532
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,339
though that that really just brings home

533
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,410
the importance of family based heritage

534
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:58,659
cannabis farms everywhere but

535
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,480
specifically here in the Emerald

536
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:05,980
triangle right it's like it's a you know

537
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,690
the ornamental and food gardens and you

538
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,640
know adds to the poly culture and the

539
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,130
fact that you've got family here helps

540
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,950
keep you feel alive and passionate right

541
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:18,010
the the ecosystem of people who are up

542
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:20,350
here working on it is very unlike what I

543
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:23,410
see in some of the valleys when they are

544
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:25,899
setting up you know kind of corporate

545
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,400
cannabis monocultures which can be

546
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,840
interesting in their own right but

547
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,970
usually it's because people are

548
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,309
explaining some kind of new to new cool

549
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,529
technology or

550
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:37,109
or mechanism right and like that can be

551
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:38,369
cool but but honestly you know dirt on

552
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,019
the boots is a pretty great mechanism

553
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:42,419
and just having all your family here is

554
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,339
good too and its culture oh yeah

555
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:47,279
the homesteaders moved out to this land

556
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:48,659
before there was cannabis here and there

557
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,950
was the back to the land movement that

558
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:56,100
was anti corporate anti-war anti

559
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,430
industrial like and the beauty that that

560
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:01,379
life created for me when I was a child

561
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:03,960
of just like having this collective

562
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:08,520
vision of hundreds and hundreds of

563
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:12,390
people that wanted to live organically

564
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:15,779
and free and having you know less less

565
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:18,600
less rules and I mean that created so

566
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:20,849
much beauty that that's kind of what

567
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:23,459
we're trying to fight for in the whole

568
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:25,649
craft cannabis movement it's like yeah

569
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,480
cannabis is important but when you chew

570
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:31,050
you smoke it with and where you're

571
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:36,509
smoking and truth that it brings out

572
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:39,289
that's much more important so one of the

573
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:42,539
things I love when I when I get to tour

574
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,529
cannabis property farms is that every

575
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,819
now and then I'll come across something

576
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:47,099
that I've never seen before and it gets

577
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:49,349
me really excited and I saw such a thing

578
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:50,579
today I saw I saw your crater garden

579
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:53,250
right and I'm gonna be talking about

580
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:55,399
this for weeks probably and you know if

581
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:59,730
I understand it correctly essentially

582
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:02,580
you you dug out an area in order to

583
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:04,500
create windbreaks for it and you took

584
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,179
all the stones that you've been finding

585
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,619
on your property and have been making

586
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:13,289
terraces of them and the idea is that

587
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:18,419
the Sun beats on them all day they are

588
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:19,950
absorbing the warmth which extends the

589
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,410
length of your day is that it was that

590
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,900
your idea when you built it yeah and it

591
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,880
just creates a really hot microclimate

592
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,050
so if you can protect the wind in a

593
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,200
horseshoe pattern and then

594
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:36,440
the rocks act as like a moisture it

595
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,809
pulls moisture in when are when it's hot

596
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,519
it pulls moisture up and when it's cold

597
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:43,039
it kind of keeps moisture in will

598
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,750
actually mulch some of the grapes and

599
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,700
some of the hotter weather plants with

600
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:52,670
rock and this little zone is in a very

601
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,620
like warmer part of our property so some

602
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,890
of the sativas that are more equatorial

603
00:26:54,619 --> 00:27:01,159
are gonna go there and we're gonna see

604
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:03,620
if they thrive like you know we're kind

605
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,440
of in this banana belt of humble up at

606
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:08,989
1,700 feet and so we don't get the fog

607
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,450
in the winter so the fog will roll in

608
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,799
right below our property and it's in

609
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,769
that crater garden it's still gonna be

610
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,559
hot in October November well alright so

611
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:20,509
first side note it must be gorgeous when

612
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,950
the clouds are below you and you're up

613
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:26,000
here I would like to see that sometime

614
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,380
but but also did you you know how did

615
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,089
the crater garden come about did you

616
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:33,200
have these these you know these

617
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:35,329
equatorial and Afghan African sativas

618
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,210
that you wanted to give them their best

619
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:40,279
chance and so you built the crater

620
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,809
garden for them or did you hear about a

621
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:43,220
crater garden you're like I will make

622
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:45,799
that and then I'll find something to

623
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,640
plant in it I mean I think it came about

624
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:51,230
how we were talking about before like

625
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,850
some of my workers I like just don't

626
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,279
tell them what to do sometimes they're

627
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:56,869
here and one of one of my workers just

628
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,139
like started building a crater garden

629
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:02,599
and I liked it so I said oh man this is

630
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,300
perfect this identified what it was and

631
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,549
then he actually ended up not finishing

632
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:11,930
it's a Lizzie came in and she started

633
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:14,180
developing it and it really just grew

634
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,250
organically like we were talking about

635
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:19,160
like it's been a community effort and

636
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,380
just before you came here it really got

637
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,769
together with tying it into the other

638
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,540
garden and so we like we're like oh my

639
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,849
god this is like this crater gardens

640
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:30,559
gonna be perfect for sativas so we

641
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:33,439
started built we built some wood sheds

642
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,690
and put our tanks like right above it to

643
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,970
act with one break and we're gonna plant

644
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:41,130
some more hedgerows some perennials and

645
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:43,890
trees above it so it will be this

646
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:48,539
so the idea just kind of developed from

647
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:51,150
being up here uh sorry um Sepp Holzer

648
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:53,339
is one of my gurus of permaculture and

649
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:57,840
he wrote a book where he was growing

650
00:28:53,339 --> 00:29:00,349
bananas in the 5000 feet in Austria so

651
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:03,720
he found a black rock on his property

652
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:07,109
right in a zone that didn't get any wind

653
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,269
and so he would plant banana trees right

654
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:11,668
in that little zone and I think he built

655
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:13,558
the little green house and the snow so

656
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:15,390
like make it laughs for the winter but

657
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:18,298
in the summer he was pulling bananas out

658
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:21,419
of 5,000 feet in Austria jeez pretty

659
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:23,400
amazing so so in that same vein of like

660
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,980
you know a rare crop in a rare place

661
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:29,820
you've built this gorgeous crater garden

662
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:32,460
that looks cool it handles moisture well

663
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:34,439
and it's going to be warmer for longer

664
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,870
than the day what are you planning there

665
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,308
this year like like that's a special

666
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:40,349
place now right it's almost like an

667
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:41,668
altar in a lot of ways what do you what

668
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:44,788
are you what are you gonna grow there

669
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:48,030
because it's a small area I think we're

670
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:51,058
gonna grow this strain which is Lady

671
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:54,389
Africa which is a shesh Imani cross of

672
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:57,210
cherry pie with forbidden fruit which is

673
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:00,210
tangi teri pie and so we're gonna put

674
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,909
some of that and the sweet pink is a

675
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,548
sativa that I also source from a friend

676
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:07,590
um and that probability is gonna go

677
00:30:05,548 --> 00:30:10,408
there too I did used to have Colombia go

678
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:13,519
old and Acapulco gold and I have some

679
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:34,890
rare seeds but I didn't start those

680
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:38,220
because the planet do so dumb the the

681
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:40,860
the strain you mentioned was ladies lady

682
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,769
Africa and the name of your farm is lady

683
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,240
sativa mm-hmm and so am I correct to

684
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:48,538
suggest that you made this cross here

685
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,870
yourself yeah I mean just like Bob Dylan

686
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:54,908
like does anybody have complete

687
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:56,949
authority over what they make so yes I

688
00:30:54,909 --> 00:31:00,759
friends that brought me seeds and I

689
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:02,859
crossed some of those one of my friends

690
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:04,899
crossed the lady Africa or the session

691
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:09,249
money with cherry pie and then I cross

692
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:11,469
it with forbidden fruit where I'm going

693
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:15,669
with this is the fact that that

694
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:17,079
particular cultivars the bio regionalism

695
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:19,299
of them is really important right now

696
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:22,598
and you know even though you are

697
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:26,499
bringing land races in from Africa via

698
00:31:22,598 --> 00:31:30,038
friends once once you once it got here

699
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:32,139
you started doing large-scale sips on

700
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:35,048
your own property in your own soil

701
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:37,269
to see you which-which Kiev ours we're

702
00:31:35,048 --> 00:31:40,329
gonna love where you live right and then

703
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:44,979
you chose fie knows to plant this year

704
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:46,028
based on on your local area and and I

705
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:48,460
think that that's probably going to

706
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:50,499
become increasingly popular right as as

707
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,929
most of the industry moves to

708
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:55,028
commoditize cannabis where you know

709
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:56,889
you've got one hip strain that happens

710
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:58,720
to be you know mentioned in a magazine

711
00:31:56,888 --> 00:32:02,138
and then everybody wants that it's like

712
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,729
okay you know for the PERT for a general

713
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:06,488
buying public that might be legitimate

714
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:10,840
but for people like you that are like

715
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:12,669
very seriously craft I think that you

716
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:15,519
know the things that you're growing on

717
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:17,859
your farm that tastes unique because

718
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,649
it's been grown in your soil is going to

719
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:22,269
become more prevalent and I'm guessing

720
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:24,278
that you agree with that because we saw

721
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:25,868
you're you're you're seated light depth

722
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:27,940
right and so you're producing your own

723
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:30,668
seeds would you tell us a little bit

724
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,970
about the importance for you for

725
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:35,169
producing your own seed and and why it's

726
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:39,368
important to do it on your own property

727
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:44,649
I mean the pulp process is so exciting

728
00:32:39,368 --> 00:32:47,138
is to plant your whole land and then go

729
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:51,248
out and find the plant that's thriving

730
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:52,719
the most find the smells fine and then

731
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:55,899
you have your male garden and you're

732
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,889
pulling the ones that aren't what you

733
00:32:55,898 --> 00:33:01,868
want and checking the structure and

734
00:32:58,888 --> 00:33:03,728
smelling the turps and then thinking

735
00:33:01,868 --> 00:33:08,740
gone home and like waking up at 2:00 in

736
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:10,990
the morning oh my god so

737
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:13,569
I breed like the old-school way where I

738
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:15,880
just have a male garden on another part

739
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:18,278
of my property and then I go and I

740
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,250
select out the plants that I love most

741
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:25,240
and are doing the best in my on my land

742
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:27,250
and then cross those with each other and

743
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,960
so it's just a constant selection of

744
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:33,490
like what's what's what's doing and and

745
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,829
I make enough crosses I mean I mean I

746
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:38,288
make so many I'll probably do 50

747
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:41,889
different seed types per year even more

748
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:44,440
and then and then mark them and then go

749
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:47,200
back and taste the flower and smell it

750
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,110
as it's getting harvested and like have

751
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,600
mental notes of which one was the right

752
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:58,808
one and then next year it's really a

753
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:01,000
really a joy to go through a green house

754
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:02,710
during a sift when the plants are

755
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,359
allowed to grow taller because like

756
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,750
sometimes if you're gonna do a huge sift

757
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:09,009
they need to stay small and and you

758
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,230
can't really see their full adult

759
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:13,300
expression I know but these light depth

760
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,969
seeded plants are you know are coming up

761
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,889
our shoulders now and to see you know a

762
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:20,949
whole line of them that came from the

763
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,990
same folks and yet you know this one's

764
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:24,579
got this you know deep purple but it's

765
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:26,199
only underneath the leaves and they're

766
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:28,659
all they're all expressing themselves in

767
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:31,809
different ways you know for those of us

768
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,780
who really love the plant that's really

769
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:37,480
cool to see so so so that we can all

770
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,790
kind of share in in your joy on this or

771
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,139
or nerdiness how we look at it what are

772
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:42,608
a couple of where some of the crosses

773
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:44,108
they just give us like you know two or

774
00:34:42,608 --> 00:34:44,829
three that you are most excited about

775
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:47,199
this year

776
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:49,750
yeah the one we were talking about is

777
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:53,769
the pure cush line pop from Mean Gene

778
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:56,079
and Mendocino um which I grew I've grown

779
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:59,650
a few times and it's just an amazing

780
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,299
plant cross with fruit loops from

781
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,730
huckleberry hill farms up here and

782
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,760
humble so I'm taking my favorite from

783
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:09,030
one region crossing it with my favorite

784
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,580
from this region and the two together

785
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:15,519
hasn't been done yet so that I'm super

786
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:17,949
excited about that one what are the some

787
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:19,880
of the other ones that Lady Africa

788
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,439
forbidden fruit

789
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,548
like that one's really gonna come

790
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,679
together I did do a CB v cross last year

791
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:32,389
or the year before which I call ad

792
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:35,239
Benbow and that's a Lyon squibbitt which

793
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:37,909
is gone genetics he's out of Palm

794
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:42,348
Springs but it's like a Spanish variety

795
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:46,368
of CBD cross with another mean gene

796
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:48,769
strain which was Pina oh yeah and that

797
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:51,380
lines quip it hats like this mersin deep

798
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:54,108
purple and the Pina is much more fruity

799
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,240
and you smelled that today and that

800
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:57,739
that's been a really fun string because

801
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,348
it does so good around here it never

802
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:03,919
gets mauled it's just like it likes this

803
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:06,650
dry climate but it with the humble

804
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,099
climate it's like the buds are stacked

805
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:13,639
hard and like full of resin and that's

806
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:17,019
the CNE plan um but I have so many

807
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:19,219
crosses that I didn't plant this year

808
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:20,868
you know one of the things that I found

809
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:23,268
interesting is as we went through the

810
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:24,829
different gardens you had a lot of

811
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:27,258
crosses with names that I was not

812
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:29,900
familiar with and you know it's not like

813
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:31,789
I go deep into the history of crosses

814
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,789
you know I usually interview people who

815
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:36,619
are far more expert than that but but

816
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:38,210
what you kept on same as like oh I got

817
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:40,460
this from this farm or I got this from

818
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:44,240
this farm or this is this is oh this is

819
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:47,480
his reserved seed right yeah and it kind

820
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:50,209
of gave me a look inside of the farmer

821
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,068
to farmer trading of seeds yeah and and

822
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,900
certainly their seed swaps right yeah

823
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:57,679
but but what I was kind of picking up

824
00:36:53,900 --> 00:37:02,108
from you was way more informal and and

825
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:05,199
like way more family to family almost

826
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:09,578
what can you say about the importance of

827
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:12,649
cannabis farmers within a bio region

828
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:15,048
trading seeds outside of Commerce oh

829
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:20,769
yeah I mean that's the whole history of

830
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:20,768
our of our community here is like we're

831
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,480
anti-commercial even some of the best I

832
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,309
mean most of the best things that I've

833
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,849
received have come through that channel

834
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:33,230
like I have the Green Lantern this year

835
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,750
stopped planting

836
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:38,059
7b plans of green lantern I didn't pay

837
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:40,789
for those seats I mean they're probably

838
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:42,679
worth you know hundreds and hundreds of

839
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:46,039
dollars on the market you can't even get

840
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:47,089
those seats but the person that in that

841
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,590
with the Emerald cup winner from

842
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:51,470
Ridgeline who got it from the same guy

843
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:53,539
that I got it from but he just like my

844
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:56,449
workers one of his best friends and

845
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:58,009
that's how they trick we trade and it's

846
00:37:56,449 --> 00:38:00,319
the same thing within this community

847
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:04,030
it's like I don't need to buy anything

848
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:09,070
from anybody really because I get

849
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:12,680
inspiring conversations and I get food I

850
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:14,750
mean yes we have a commerce but I just

851
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,809
think that the craft movement it's gonna

852
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:20,480
be defined community that holds it tight

853
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:25,549
and talks and comes to the meetings and

854
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:34,099
really built this non commerce network

855
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:36,019
so the best things I get well thank you

856
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:38,000
