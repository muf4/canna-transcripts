1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,759
um it is common for folks though to

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,839
socialize and medicate outside

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,399
afterwards so if you want to hang out

4
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:20,800
you know you know Jeff's going to give

5
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,799
the demo and then we're going to you

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,800
know we'll give away the raffle stuff

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,880
and then you know people kind of hang

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,679
out and mingle and then puff outside and

9
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,079
then I hear that there's quite a party

10
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:31,000
down on the dock and on the boat

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,878
afterwards

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,480
so the um the the fairy workers actually

13
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:38,000
tell me that they they actually know

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:44,679
about us and about

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,759
our and it's cool anyway so we've got a

16
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,039
reputation all right it's a good

17
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,280
reputation yeah it's a really good

18
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,640
reputation nobody's bummed out with us

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,039
so so so tonight's demo is from Jeff

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,439
Church also known globally as cannabis

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,359
Reverend Jeff has mastered every modern

22
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,759
extraction technique and most of the

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,920
ancient ones he has traveled the world

24
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,719
to learn uh both exotic techniques as

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,280
well as spread modern techniques from

26
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,319
the United States last year he went to

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,799
spannabis in Spain and turned on all

28
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,639
sorts of the world famous canvas Legends

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,960
onto rosin oil and gave rosin Dabs at

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,840
the Cannabis Museum there in Spain he is

31
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,919
a patient advocate from way back uh he

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,200
has been on the front he has been in

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,478
front of the laws helping people helping

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,840
humans get relief since the very early

35
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,799
days here here in Washington Jeff is

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,880
presently an extractor at 502 processor

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,640
puff and farms and he continues to

38
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,078
consult everywhere as well um he and his

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,799
wife have also just welcomed their

40
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:45,078
second child into the world too so

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,079
that's a

42
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:54,039
win so so Jeff is absolutely one of my

43
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,839
mentors but even more so I'm grateful to

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,439
be able to call him a friend it is very

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,439
much my honor to present to you Jeff

46
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,438
Church

47
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,879
thank you for that warm introduction

48
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,239
Shango that was wonderful so uh I'm glad

49
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,039
that everybody came out here tonight

50
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,159
it's a wonderful wonderful crowd for a

51
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,719
really great method of Hashi extraction

52
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:20,639
so tonight we're talking about toble

53
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:23,560
hash and it's pretty simple it's ice

54
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,199
water and agitation that's pretty much

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,120
it beyond that you have screens that

56
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,799
filter out different sizes of particles

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,280
so you'll have uh your plant material in

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,319
one uh and then you'll have all of your

59
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,878
valuable resins on on other sizes so it

60
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:44,399
takes a little while uh for the Cannabis

61
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,318
to rehydrate uh and so I'm going to dump

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,959
that into the water right now I've got a

63
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:52,238
bucket over here 5 gallon bucket uh

64
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,560
filled up you know a little over halfway

65
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,719
uh and I've got some ice in there

66
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,560
there's been cooling the water um this

67
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:02,680
is a 133 G of what was the strange

68
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,199
change go uh California Girls California

69
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,239
Girls seeds from seeds are from Humble

70
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,238
yeah some Vashon outdoor uh cannabis

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,120
right here so it's this is just little

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,599
uh tiny popcorn buds uh so we'll toss it

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,599
on in the

74
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,639
water and then uh so I've iced this

75
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,359
water previously but I'm also going to

76
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,518
throw some more ice on the top of it so

77
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,319
it kind of makes a sandwich of ice

78
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,319
cannabis and more ice on the

79
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,840
then I'll add a little bit more water

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,959
here to the top just to make sure that

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,239
all of the Cannabis is uh exposed to

82
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,239
this cold cold

83
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,438
water all right so ideally I like to let

84
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:02,318
this soak for up to 30 minutes uh to to

85
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:05,959
rehydrate the material especially if

86
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:08,919
it's uh dry material um you can also run

87
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,560
fresh material that's frozen uh they

88
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:14,559
call it fresh Frozen um and uh it it

89
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,439
makes a really nice bubble hash but it's

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,918
not something that you really need to

91
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,519
rehydrate so you kind of toss it in

92
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,758
there everything's cold out of the

93
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,680
freezer you put it into the bucket uh

94
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,840
and start going um but so tonight I'm

95
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,800
going to just do this dry uh dry

96
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,319
material method so what what you do is

97
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,038
uh you've got several different uh sizes

98
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:39,360
of bags um the smallest one that that we

99
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:43,759
have which is going to go in first is a

100
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:48,120
25 micron bag and so it's a it's pretty

101
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:51,360
simple it's a 25 micron mesh on some

102
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,519
kind of a uh you know jacket type

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:05:00,560
material yeah canvas type material and

104
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:00,560
uh so just set these bags in here and

105
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,160
so I like to do all of my mixing in one

106
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,800
bucket uh rather than inside of the bags

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,680
uh you know kind of the first methods

108
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,400
that people were doing they were mixing

109
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,560
inside of the bags um but I found that

110
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,599
it actually puts some wear and tear on

111
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,759
the bags uh so that's not really

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,479
something that you want to do if you

113
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,840
want to save your your uh your bags give

114
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,839
them as long of life as possible these

115
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,439
bags in particular are quite old they

116
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,279
they've been being used for about 10

117
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:39,000
years now so yeah so so they will last

118
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,599
quite well um I just got these back from

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,439
a friend of mine that I had loaned them

120
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,720
to um you wash them in the machine

121
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,719
washable or do you yeah so you you can

122
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,960
definitely wash them in the machine I

123
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,800
would say that uh you know you want to

124
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:56,038
save that uh for doing that every once

125
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,000
in a while not with every run what I

126
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,159
like to do with the bags is is I'll take

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,600
them uh after they're done

128
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,120
and rinse all of the uh the material out

129
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,479
of them if there's any resin stuck to

130
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,399
the screens I'll take some alcohol and

131
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,879
and use some alcohol to free the resins

132
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,918
off the screens and give it another uh

133
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,759
another soak um as well with some

134
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,198
alcohol and then I put it into a bucket

135
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,160
of water and just kind of uh massage

136
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,720
them around and get get the handh yeah

137
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,720
give it a little hand wash so it's

138
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,120
really gentle um but you can also um you

139
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,919
can also put them into the washing

140
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,160
machine and i' I put you know a cup of

141
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,918
vinegar in there with them and that kind

142
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,479
of gets any kind of musty smell that

143
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:41,079
they might have it kind of cuts that

144
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,079
down a bit um and then do make sure you

145
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,959
do an extra rinse on them because you

146
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,198
don't want to have that vinegar flavor

147
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,159
into you know if they still smell like

148
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,240
vinegar that's not a good thing um so

149
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,360
yeah so the first the first bag was a 25

150
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,879
micron bag the second bag is a 45 Micron

151
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,720
bag and so these sizes uh as they get

152
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:05,759
larger um that's also a larger ho size

153
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:10,240
of the screen so um so then we'll move

154
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,240
on to a 73 Micron

155
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:20,159
bag do you worry at all about like that

156
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,199
contamination or kind of Ms or funguses

157
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
from reing

158
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,000
bags

159
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,240
wash yeah definitely definitely and you

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,079
know we've actually run into some some

161
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,038
issues uh in the medical Market uh

162
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:39,959
making products um you know we we had uh

163
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,878
and we really don't know where the

164
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,079
contamination came from uh but we had

165
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,080
some samples that tested positive for

166
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:50,598
ecoli so yeah so they never made it out

167
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,519
to uh to patients to to smoke we just

168
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,560
destroyed the material um but yeah it's

169
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,198
definitely a concern there's bacteria

170
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,680
and and molds and and such they will

171
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,478
grow row on the material on on the bag

172
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,519
material so um you

173
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:11,800
know yeah so so

174
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:14,439
like at your I2 yes we do run we do run

175
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,240
these bags at i502 and you know we're

176
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,680
just very careful to keep them very

177
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,158
clean you know as soon as you're done uh

178
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,240
doing doing the wash you want to make

179
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,560
sure that you wash your bags as

180
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,360
well water or just regular tap water

181
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,519
just regular tap actually well water

182
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,599
where I'm at but but it has really low

183
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,560
parts per

184
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,158
million in it and it's it's very clean

185
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,598
water um a lot of people do use RO water

186
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,080
though that's definitely reverse osmosis

187
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,278
water is is a popular thing people will

188
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,320
will make their ice cubes out of reverse

189
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:53,838
osmosis water and um you know I haven't

190
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,879
really gone to to that length um I I I

191
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,079
have um used in the medical side we had

192
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,200
an ice machine that we were using uh and

193
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:03,559
so we we hooked up carbon filters to

194
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,079
that uh and that was good enough for us

195
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,479
to to have uh you know have some some

196
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,838
good clean clean water but tonight we're

197
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,959
just using bag

198
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,480
dice so and and you know i' I've never

199
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,000
really been too terribly worried about

200
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,278
it for my own consumption uh bacteria

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,559
and things like that but it's definitely

202
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,720
a concern for the 502 Market because

203
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,518
your products are going to fail uh

204
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,399
microbial testing and you're going to

205
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,720
have lots that you have to destroy you

206
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,559
know um or I guess you can technically

207
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,720
extract those with other methods but you

208
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:39,439
know then you're extracting whatever the

209
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,440
molds and bacterias are along with it um

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,440
so these first three bags that I put in

211
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,959
here the 25 micron bag the 45 Micron bag

212
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,480
and the 73 Micron bag or where you

213
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,559
generally get uh your hashes um this

214
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,920
next bag that I just slipped in here is

215
00:09:52,559 --> 00:10:01,679
160 Micron bag um and this one is is

216
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:04,799
your very largest uh and heads and plant

217
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,958
material so you'll you'll get sometimes

218
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,759
you you'll get like a greenish uh

219
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:13,439
material that comes out of this um the

220
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:15,720
190 Micron bag I have seen only a couple

221
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,680
times anything that you really want to

222
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,680
smoke come out of this and that's from a

223
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,719
plant that has extremely large resin

224
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,159
heads um but usually it's just kind of

225
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,320
the green Duff it's it's like an extra

226
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:31,240
catch bag uh for the plant

227
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,839
material flip those in

228
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:38,200
there and then finally this blue bag is

229
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,120
What's called the work bag uh you know

230
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,639
that's that's what you know the original

231
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,959
name for it was the work bag I don't do

232
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,399
any of the work in there anymore like I

233
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,719
said because it'll break up the bag um

234
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:56,559
but this is a 220 Micron bag uh right

235
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:59,839
here um they used to sell a 250 Micron

236
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,359
bag which I have one of and I rarely use

237
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,519
uh that that they kind of said was for

238
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,639
commercial production so that you can

239
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,679
make sure that you're getting the most

240
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:14,079
resin out uh of the pl material fastest

241
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,799
um the 220 Micron bag might hold back a

242
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,958
little bit of resin it might get clogged

243
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,479
um a little bit so doing successive

244
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:25,479
washes will really help you get it out

245
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,759
but um you know I the 250 Micron I kind

246
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,278
of just moved away from that so so

247
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,759
that's the B right there uh plant

248
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,759
material will go in this in this bucket

249
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:40,159
here

250
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,879
um then we have this right here question

251
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,759
yes are the colors in the number

252
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,439
standard yes they are yeah so the purple

253
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:51,759
is going to be the 25 micron always the

254
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:55,720
45 Micron is white uh the 73 Micron is

255
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:58,360
yellow um there is a 120 Micron I'm just

256
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,360
going to grab this as a prop bubble man

257
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,639
was kind enough to send down a whole set

258
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,560
so this is the coveted door priz right

259
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,480
here whoy person is that gets them um

260
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,278
but so there's an orange color and this

261
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,959
is 120 Micron I'm not using it tonight

262
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:17,240
but it's definitely something that uh

263
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:20,078
I've used in the past and uh it will be

264
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,759
an extra filter above your 73 Micron

265
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:27,399
that can lead to slightly uh more pure

266
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,720
product on your 73 Micron um but you

267
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,360
know for for the purposes of the

268
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
demonstration tonight it's not really

269
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,560
necessary to splice it out too terribly

270
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:40,559
much um there's also one that I forgot

271
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,039
there's a 90 Micron bag which goes right

272
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,518
above your 73 and it does the same sort

273
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,439
of a thing uh kind of splitting the

274
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,480
Micron size up uh so that you can have a

275
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,320
tighter fraction of the resin heads uh

276
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,720
in in size um and then let's see is

277
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,519
there any other one that I'm forgetting

278
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:06,440
no uh and then you know the 160 Micron

279
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:10,560
red green for 190 uh and blue is the uh

280
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,519
work bag um the 220 so they're they're

281
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,638
always the same at least in the bubble

282
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,078
bag brand uh there's lots of other

283
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,079
brands out there U but bubble man was

284
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:22,278
the first one in North America to

285
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,559
provide bubble bags and so I've been

286
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,919
using these bags for years and years

287
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,159
yeah since uh 2001 I think was the first

288
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:34,519
time I got to set of bubble B

289
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,679
so yeah and they actually they offer um

290
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,000
two different kinds of bags they have

291
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,879
this standard set here that I'm using

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,799
and then they also have the bubble bag

293
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:47,159
light set which is a slightly cheaper

294
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,799
material um I guess you know not as

295
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,120
heavy duty um and they don't carry a

296
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,198
warranty like these ones do these ones

297
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,560
are lifetime warranty if you ever have

298
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:58,278
anything that goes wrong with them any

299
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,399
one of the bags they'll send you a new

300
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:02,439
bag no problem so and they've been

301
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,399
really good about about honoring that

302
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,519
even with the much larger sets you know

303
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,360
it's it's been no problem to get

304
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,600
reimburse or get a new a new bag sent

305
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,480
down so cool um so yeah the the one

306
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,639
other screen that you have uh is this

307
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,800
and this is a 25 micron uh pressing

308
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,959
screen they call it a blotting screen

309
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:27,278
it's a pressing screen and uh basically

310
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,559
you the idea is you put your hashish on

311
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,078
here and then you're able to

312
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,399
squeeze out a little bit of the excess

313
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:38,359
water and so that's that's kind of what

314
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:42,600
this is for what we've kind of move

315
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,440
towards uh in canas extraction is doing

316
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,959
rosin right and so this right here was

317
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,360
the very first screen at least that I

318
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:53,879
know of uh that was used for U making

319
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,919
rosin and so you put your hashish in

320
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:59,519
here and and you fold it over then you

321
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:02,879
you uh with heat and pressure squeeze it

322
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,519
and the hashes extrudes out of it so you

323
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:10,198
know I was actually down in Oakland uh

324
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,198
with a friend of mine uh uh space and he

325
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,599
and I were sitting around saying hey you

326
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:16,758
know how are we going to make this rosin

327
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,519
no nobody had really put out there in

328
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:24,440
social media world how to filter your

329
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,519
rosin um and so we were saying oh jeez

330
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,360
you know really what we need is a filter

331
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,759
because all this material is just kind

332
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,800
of running here and there a to get a

333
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,680
little bit of high quality oil out of it

334
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,838
but most of it's contaminated with the

335
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:40,318
rest of the hash so um I said you know

336
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,199
hey we we need a filter and my friend

337
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:45,039
Spacey said hey I've got a filter I've

338
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:48,519
got a 25 micron filter let's do this and

339
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:52,000
so that it was uh the method was born

340
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:55,120
rosin right there so um so yeah some of

341
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,399
the other tools that that we use um I

342
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,440
like to dry on parchment paper um

343
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:03,120
parchment paper seems to

344
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,839
be kind of the best method for you know

345
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,240
home uh home use at least um and then on

346
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:13,199
cardboard uh and so then the cardboard

347
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,159
acts as as a desk and it draws out the

348
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,399
the moisture from from the hashish uh

349
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,600
that that basically your paper will get

350
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,759
wet it'll draw the moisture out as well

351
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,959
and then that draws it away again so

352
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:29,440
it's kind of a way to mitigate U having

353
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,078
too moist a pases CU you know as we were

354
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,360
discussing earlier there's big issues

355
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,879
with M microbes uh as as far as I know

356
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,959
yeah go

357
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:41,838
ahead would there be any point in

358
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:43,838
setting that on on a low heat Source you

359
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,399
would not want to apply heat to it

360
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:52,880
actually cold is is better um heat will

361
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,159
heat the resin and it'll melt and any uh

362
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,278
there's a possibility that there's going

363
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,039
to be water in there if it hasn't dried

364
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,838
all the way and that water will kind of

365
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,639
get clogged in inside of the resin it'll

366
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,919
it'll lead to more mold so it's it's

367
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,038
actually better to not have it in a hot

368
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,400
hot area you don't want in direct

369
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:15,318
sunlight or anything like that so you

370
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,720
know just you know uh yeah

371
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:21,199
um but yeah so so the microbial issue is

372
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,519
definitely definitely a big thing as as

373
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,318
far as I know it's it's about 8 hours

374
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:29,279
that uh it takes for microbes uh to

375
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:31,558
start growing after water has been

376
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,359
introduced to them uh so in the drying

377
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,879
process there's going to be some amount

378
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:40,159
of microbes and of bacteria um that is

379
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,480
going to bloom uh and so you want to

380
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,679
really use material that doesn't have

381
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,079
microbes in large amounts you want to

382
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:53,240
kind of keep that as uh you know it's

383
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,319
just not advisable to to run material um

384
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,319
molding

385
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,119
material material like powdering Milo or

386
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:01,240
mices and such things of that that

387
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,399
nature you know I mean it's it's always

388
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,440
best to use the highest quality input

389
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,360
that you can it's going to give you the

390
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:14,558
highest quality output um so but uh but

391
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:18,359
for you know the 502 World um what what

392
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:22,000
we kind of come up with now is a freeze

393
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:24,879
dryer and so if you take your material

394
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,720
and it goes right into the freezer uh

395
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,559
and it's frozen then you pop it into the

396
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,240
freeze dryer um you're able to keep the

397
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:36,599
material

398
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,159
um both you're you're able to get less

399
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,759
oxidation with the material so it's it's

400
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:45,600
going to stay a much lighter color which

401
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,119
is more uh appealing to the consumer um

402
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,319
and you're also going to have this

403
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,279
microbial issue is basically beaten

404
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,240
right because you don't give it the

405
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:57,200
chance to bloom the the microbes aren't

406
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,720
going to bloom in the freezer the freeze

407
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,319
dryer is going to sublimate the water

408
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,079
away from the material uh and so you're

409
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,558
going to end up with a dry Sandy product

410
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:09,279
that hasn't had the chance to kind of

411
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,038
Clump together and and and get you know

412
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,200
globed together because it stays all dry

413
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,480
the resin heads are rock hard when

414
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,840
they're cold uh so it's able to kind of

415
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,519
dry everything um and also put freezing

416
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,359
it will expand in water that's in there

417
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,839
so it actually kind of moves the resin

418
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:30,158
heads away from each other just a slight

419
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:32,759
bit um so that it's able to uh dry

420
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:35,280
inside of the Patty that you put into

421
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:36,960
the freeze dryer so I really recommend

422
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,599
that I think that the freeze dryer is

423
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,679
the the best method for drying bubble

424
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,519
hash that we've we've come up with yet

425
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:48,919
so um but yeah it progressed I mean when

426
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:51,359
I first started making bubble hash there

427
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,559
wasn't even a recommendation to use

428
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:58,199
cardboard um and so it was like you know

429
00:19:54,558 --> 00:20:00,599
use like a paper plate or use a plate

430
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,558
itself you know I mean it was really

431
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:06,079
really you know there wasn't much out

432
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:08,240
there for information and then uh then

433
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,558
we we came up with the cardboard uh

434
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,159
cardboards seem to work great except for

435
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,918
with the kind of the stickier resins

436
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:16,960
they would get stuck to the cardboard

437
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,600
you get pieces of paper that came out of

438
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,480
it so that's kind of not the best way

439
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,839
parchment when that that idea came

440
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,759
around really kind of won me over for

441
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,079
sure because uh you're able to get the

442
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,000
material off of the parchment without

443
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:33,720
having uh much of the parchment come off

444
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,960
hopefully none of the parchment coming

445
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,798
off um Jeff yes did it not work to

446
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,519
decarb it before it

447
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:44,599
started well if you decarbed it um most

448
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,359
likely the resin heads would

449
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:51,279
melt so they would be unaccessible by

450
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,359
the water extraction method yeah so they

451
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,119
would

452
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:58,719
definitely I would say unless you're

453
00:20:54,119 --> 00:21:01,639
doing a really long wa it's big a m i um

454
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,679
so um so yeah so the rest of the tools

455
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,440
here that I have um got pressing screen

456
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,679
the parchment uh this you know this was

457
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,840
just kind of a banker's box lid uh and

458
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,720
it's just nice for transportation so if

459
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,720
you're going to make it somewhere and

460
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,558
move it somewhere else it's nice to have

461
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,759
that um I usually just cut up a a

462
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:23,759
cardboard box at home and then tape a

463
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:27,679
piece of parchment to it but this seems

464
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:31,319
to be a nice method um I like to use a

465
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,080
Civ uh to break up the the bubble hash

466
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:37,038
so that it can dry properly so uh you'll

467
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:40,359
put all of your your bubble hash in here

468
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,679
and then take a silicone spatula and

469
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:45,599
kind of move it around and and it'll uh

470
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,880
it'll come through the Sie uh and you

471
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,759
can spread it out kind of evenly on this

472
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,278
this cardboard and then I use just a

473
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:55,558
dish brush uh to kind of clean up uh any

474
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,200
excess uh bubble that gets stuck to this

475
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:00,158
tool so that you don't lose a whole

476
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,558
bunch there um you're able to get back

477
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,919
and then uh you know just a plastic card

478
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:09,720
is something that's nice to to move out

479
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:12,120
the bubble hash if if it's in too thick

480
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,038
of a pile if if when you're working with

481
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,119
your Sie too much of it fell in one area

482
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:20,558
you can kind of move it around and uh

483
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:23,558
spread that out um and then a spoon to

484
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,678
get it out of the bags and so I've used

485
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:28,519
all kinds of different tools um there's

486
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,240
a lot of other great tools but some

487
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,079
since we're just doing this for home use

488
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,759
figured this be a great thing CU

489
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,558
everybody has one of

490
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,720
these yeah

491
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,678
so all

492
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,919
right got a few more minutes here any

493
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,080
other questions that people have at the

494
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,640
moment tell us about the different types

495
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,678
of hash and why you would use one versus

496
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,360
another so the different extraction

497
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,320
methods that that are out there okay

498
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:57,439
well um you know we've got uh this

499
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,759
bubble hash uh it's definitely a great

500
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,440
method it's a nonsolvent method although

501
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:06,038
water is technically a solvent there are

502
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:11,120
Turin that are water soluble that are

503
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:14,679
being extracted but uh it's it's kind of

504
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:17,079
the it it's the least of a solvent uh of

505
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,640
all of the methods out there um then

506
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,399
there's dry sift so that would be using

507
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,320
screens uh and kind of doing a similar

508
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,640
thing uh but without water right so

509
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:31,278
that's that's another method dry sift is

510
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,640
is really nice kind of gives you the um

511
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:37,440
unadulterated or

512
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:40,679
un uh it's it has the least refinement I

513
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,159
guess of all the processes out there um

514
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,240
I've done a lot of uh CO2 extraction as

515
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,840
well but that takes really expensive

516
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,079
Machinery uh and so that's not really a

517
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,399
home method um and that's that's a great

518
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,158
solvent it's you know something that's a

519
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,000
fairly green solvent a lot of the CO2 is

520
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,600
just waste uh from industry that's

521
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,558
recaptured and so that's definitely a a

522
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:08,519
nice way to to use that um butane

523
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:11,798
extraction propane you know all of those

524
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,440
things are are interesting what lemine

525
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:18,158
yeah uh and and you know those those

526
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,919
hydrocarbon solvents uh are great for

527
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,640
getting the canabo content out of the

528
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,520
material economically right so it's not

529
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:30,320
very expensive for a setup as compared

530
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:32,398
to a CO2 extractor um that the time that

531
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:35,759
it takes to do the extraction is much

532
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:39,119
reduced uh compared to a CO2 extractor

533
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:42,720
um but you know each of these solvents

534
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:46,079
has a specific uh capacity for

535
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,880
extracting the constituents so certain

536
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,319
things are going to be

537
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,480
extracted uh with your different

538
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:56,678
solvents that wouldn't necessarily be

539
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,798
extracted in the same way uh from other

540
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,840
solvents would it be good to assume that

541
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,240
if you're using ethanol extraction

542
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,558
you're taking all the trines in their

543
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,880
natural form with you yeah so that that

544
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,359
was actually the very next one that I

545
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,679
was going to get to so uh ethanol is a

546
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:16,199
great uh extraction medium um it has the

547
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:19,519
disadvantage that when you're going to

548
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,558
uh remove the ethanol uh from from the

549
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,480
extract you're also going to remove a

550
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:27,038
lot of the Turin uh especially the the

551
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,240
most volatile Turin those are going to

552
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,480
just hop on over with the alcohol and

553
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,960
you're going to end up with a turpine

554
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,038
INF infused alcohol well I wor about

555
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,480
that because alcohol is a is a hydropic

556
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,839
rather than hydrob so it's it's going to

557
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,759
when they're together it's going to hold

558
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:46,359
a certain amount of water with it mhm

559
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:49,798
yeah it's uh you know that's that's

560
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:53,959
definitely true and and also uh it it

561
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:56,359
will extract the the water content of

562
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,319
the plant material as well so uh but

563
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,240
it's definitely a great uh great

564
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,678
extraction method um that's that's

565
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,640
really good for RSO and such yes sir um

566
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,798
does ambient room temperature have any

567
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,360
play on um like the manipulation of the

568
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:14,038
the half she after being extracted or

569
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:17,558
even during extraction yeah so you know

570
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:20,640
with bubble hash uh or dry sift um you

571
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:22,678
really want to have uh the coldest

572
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,440
environment possible that's that's the

573
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,919
best way to go about it you're you're

574
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:31,120
doing this extraction in cold because

575
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:33,080
the resin heads hardened up uh they will

576
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,879
also free themselves from the plant

577
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,678
material a lot easier when they are hard

578
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,919
uh so they just Shear off really easy

579
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,200
they just crack like ice would crack

580
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,360
right um so you know I I would

581
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,080
definitely recommend that if you're

582
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:48,240
going to do bubble hash on any kind of

583
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,639
commercial scale you want to have a cold

584
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,599
room so you know either a walk-in

585
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,759
freezer uh that you're working in or

586
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,839
having um a room that you've outfitted

587
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,079
with a u uh an air conditioner that

588
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,119
you've overclocked there's a really cool

589
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:06,000
Gadget it's called a a

590
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,558
coolbot uh and so you you hook this in

591
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,440
there and and and basically it takes any

592
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,359
air conditioner and tricks it um it it

593
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,759
it

594
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:19,639
will have a little heater uh that heats

595
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:21,879
up by the temperature sensor so that the

596
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,759
air conditioner thinks that it's not as

597
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,640
cold as it actually is and then it has

598
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:28,599
another sensor that that reads the

599
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,320
outtake of the condenser so that it

600
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:33,359
knows when the condenser is going to ice

601
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,519
over so it'll basically make sure that

602
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,319
you're not going to destroy your

603
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,038
equipment but at the same time it

604
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:43,200
overclocks it makes it so you can get it

605
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,879
down to I think it's uh in the high 30s

606
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,960
is is what you can get with one of those

607
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,880
but but you know I I see a lot of people

608
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,240
set their rooms at 55 that's a common um

609
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,880
extraction temperature so um and doing

610
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,480
doing everything you know the moment

611
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,919
that I that I pull the hashish out of

612
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,278
the bags it's warming up and so by the

613
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,120
time I get it into this uh to this C if

614
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:06,278
I don't work fast enough and it's a

615
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:09,558
really gooey strain it's just going to

616
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:13,119
gum up all over this the SI and and

617
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:14,759
become a problem so um you want to work

618
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,558
fast when when you're doing that that's

619
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:19,398
kind of what what we've always done and

620
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,200
then you know now the new method is cold

621
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,839
rooms you know and then you don't have

622
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,080
to be as stressed about how fast you're

623
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:29,119
doing everything so yeah so you only

624
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:32,079
make cash in a month with

625
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:35,199
are that's definitely a a good way to do

626
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:38,918
it um and it happens to be when uh the

627
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,240
Harvest is in usually so traditionally I

628
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:45,600
I've made the bulk of the hashes in the

629
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,359
last month of the year and you know

630
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,959
January and February as well so those

631
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,839
are kind of you know December January

632
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,240
February are really really great months

633
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:56,959
for making

634
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,679
hashes yes sir so I'm sorry I don't want

635
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,798
to like

636
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,200
tear off like too advance of

637
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:06,558
topic but I'll foret if I don't and ask

638
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,200
you so um a lot of the people that uh

639
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,398
that I see that make hash I'm pretty

640
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,080
good on Instagram and stuff these guys

641
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:16,918
have a tendency to uh allow the bubble

642
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:20,519
to dry in patties for up to let's call

643
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,519
it 8 to 12 hours or or even longer in

644
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,640
cold rooms or refrigerators or something

645
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:30,399
to keep my crow grow down and then they

646
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:33,480
will either Sid or uh micr plane right

647
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,319
and um so my question to you is it

648
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,278
sounds like you're at least in this

649
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:41,000
particular uh lesson you're an advocate

650
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:42,640
of taking that bubble quickly going

651
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,240
through the process very quickly getting

652
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,120
it out there spread out so that it can

653
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,839
dry very quickly uh not or waiting that

654
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,558
time and such and I'm just wondering

655
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,918
from your point of view um do any of the

656
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:54,918
methods that I'm talking about

657
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,640
previously that did they hold any kind

658
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,080
of water uh creating a more palatable

659
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,880
product or something that maybe more

660
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,839
melty or whatever you know consumer Happ

661
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,919
right so so I would say that that

662
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,278
there's definitely advantages to doing

663
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,600
the cold cure right putting putting your

664
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:15,720
hashish

665
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:19,839
into a cold refrigerator or a you know

666
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:22,600
freezer um as well uh before you would

667
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:26,278
microplane it um if you're going to be

668
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:27,519
using the Civ I don't really see as much

669
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:28,640
advantage of that because you're going

670
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,839
to have

671
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,080
uh it's going to be so cold that it's

672
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,959
going to harden it if you put it into

673
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,759
the freezer um that that it's kind of

674
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,159
going to be hard to get through the SI

675
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:43,038
but the microplane is definitely a nice

676
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:44,320
way to go for um really sticky material

677
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,278
so if it's going to come out of your

678
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,720
bags and it's going to be really really

679
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:51,159
sticky um you're going to want to use a

680
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,720
microplane and that'll actually rupture

681
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:56,200
a lot of the heads uh when you're doing

682
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,038
the the microplaning but uh and it could

683
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,000
lead to a little bit of tpine loss but

684
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,720
if you've got a really really sticky

685
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,880
product anyways you're going to have a

686
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,038
high tpine content in there as well so

687
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,799
that lead to a more greased Out product

688
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:14,079
even after it's drive right right yeah

689
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,319
yeah definitely definitely but you know

690
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,678
the resin heads are are all created

691
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,319
differently there's you know there's

692
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,519
different amounts of uh of kind of

693
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,158
liquefiable contents I guess is what we

694
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:30,038
could say so the canono and the tpin are

695
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:32,440
are really liquefiable contents of of it

696
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:34,638
there's there's also wax uh there's

697
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,399
there's a membrane there's a cuticle and

698
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:39,519
so some of those uh constituents that

699
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:42,439
are in in the Rosen head don't really

700
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:46,120
melt so on some strains you're going to

701
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,080
have you know pure pure resin where you

702
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,119
don't really see any other contamination

703
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:54,119
when you look under a microscope but

704
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:55,918
it's not as melty when you smoke it uh

705
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,278
just because of the nature of the

706
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,480
genetics right um and then other strains

707
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,319
um are going to be super super melty uh

708
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,079
and and hard to deal with when you're

709
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,200
when you're processing so that's those

710
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:11,720
types of strains really want to do in

711
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:15,000
the cold room uh doing a cold cure is

712
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,798
definitely a good way to go but I think

713
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,519
that nowadays if if you're going to go

714
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,200
through the trouble of making that cold

715
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,278
room get a freeze dryer you know if

716
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,600
you're going to be working with that

717
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:26,359
type of material uh because it's you're

718
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:28,398
not going to have to do all this cold

719
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:31,038
curing uh you're not going to to do the

720
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,479
microplaning so you can actually take

721
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,720
this this material that previously with

722
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,240
other methods you would have to

723
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,319
microplane and instead you do the freeze

724
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,638
dryer and it comes out dry uh like a ke

725
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:46,398
um now when you're pulling that material

726
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:48,319
out of the freeze dryer it's frozen

727
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,719
right so if you're not in a cold

728
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:52,558
environment you're going to have

729
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,720
condensation right so it's going to

730
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,319
bring water from the atmosphere and put

731
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,639
it right back onto your hashish so you

732
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:01,599
definitely want want to have uh an

733
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:02,638
environment that you're doing it in

734
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,678
that's cold if you're going to be

735
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:07,719
pulling it out of the freeze dryer so

736
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,240
yeah go would you share why it's called

737
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:15,278
bubble hash bubble hash well U it's

738
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:20,200
bubble hash because of the bubbles that

739
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:22,679
form when you smoke it so um yeah so so

740
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,798
the the the more pure that it is uh the

741
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,440
more boiling effect that you're going to

742
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:29,480
have when it smokes so just like a dab

743
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,519
boil s when you when you drop it on the

744
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,038
dad BR it's the same sort of a thing uh

745
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,359
they're really you know when bubble

746
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:40,000
hatch first came around they really

747
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,879
wasn't um as much oil and there wasn't

748
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,759
you know as much of that going on this

749
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,519
is really a pure pure method uh of

750
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:50,599
extraction so that that really explained

751
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,159
what the product was itself that's being

752
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:55,638
produced so can you go ahead and tell us

753
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:59,840
about the star chart yeah definitely

754
00:33:55,638 --> 00:34:03,240
definitely um so so there's a my good

755
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:06,199
friend space down in Oakland um who I

756
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:11,039
worked with on on developing the you

757
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:14,240
know Rosen screen method um him and his

758
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:18,199
Partners down there at the bizaar which

759
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:21,118
was a um measure Z Club in Oakland so

760
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:23,719
measure Z Club is actually a place where

761
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,960
you're allowed to consume and sell

762
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,878
cannabis in the city of Oakland will

763
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,679
kind of turn their head the other way

764
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:32,279
and and and not worry about you because

765
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,200
they have a law that was passed in

766
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,879
Oakland measure Z which made it the

767
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,358
lowest enforceable priority for adult

768
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:42,199
consumption and sales in a private

769
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:45,838
setting so as long as you're not doing

770
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:50,279
it out in public then it's you

771
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:52,000
know yeah yeah yeah so um so they they

772
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,720
decided that they really needed to have

773
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,320
a hashish rating system uh because you

774
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:01,279
know back then it was really

775
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,800
you know all hash was kind of like 20 or

776
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,560
$25 a grand retail there wasn't really

777
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,440
too much difference in price even though

778
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:11,679
the quality could be drastically

779
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,079
different right so they came up with

780
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,919
this star rating system it's a one

781
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,720
through six star rating system uh and so

782
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,079
it starts off with one star being the

783
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:22,879
lowest uh and that's basically Kei

784
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:26,400
that's something that you really

785
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,720
couldn't uh press very easily with with

786
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,720
just you know the the and pressure from

787
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,239
your hand uh you couldn't really press

788
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,959
it into a Patty it just kind of crumbles

789
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:38,479
so that's that's one star two star is

790
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,199
something that you press together um and

791
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,000
then when and it'll hold and when you

792
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:46,679
smoke it on a screen it has a slight

793
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,159
milk to it it'll kind of have the sheen

794
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:50,679
where you can kind of tell that the oils

795
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:53,759
have done something but it's not really

796
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:56,838
boiling it's not really bubbling right

797
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,000
um then three star uh it'll go from

798
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:02,719
whatever shape you you put it in uh and

799
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,880
it'll melt into kind of a pile right so

800
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,919
like a it'll make like a Hast stack kind

801
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,079
of a pile out of whatever you put onto

802
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:15,480
the screen and it'll boil up into that

803
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:18,079
pile um a fourstar will melt uh down

804
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,960
into a puddle so it'll be kind of a

805
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,800
boiling puddle with contaminant so uh

806
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,960
nonm uh

807
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:30,200
constituents all over in that in that

808
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,800
puddle um and it'll kind of have like a

809
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:35,879
there'll be like a a flat a flat chunk

810
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,680
of contaminant after it stops melting um

811
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,559
five star uh it'll melt down into the

812
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:44,279
puddle and it'll actually boil the

813
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:46,960
contaminant out to the edges of the

814
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,000
screen if you these are all um being

815
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,960
rated on a screen because it's kind of

816
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,639
the easiest way to view uh what's what's

817
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,119
actually happening with the milk um so

818
00:36:55,639 --> 00:37:02,480
the contaminant will get pushed out and

819
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:05,838
it'll boil a big clear Dome uh so it's

820
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,000
it's a a big bubble uh that that has no

821
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:11,599
contaminant in it except for on the very

822
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,079
edges of it and it actually shows uh the

823
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,240
screen so you'll have like bare spot in

824
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,400
the middle of the screen and contamine

825
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,919
it uh in a ring around the edge um and

826
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,000
then six star uh which is you know the

827
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,519
height of uh of what you can produce um

828
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,880
will boil and it it doesn't really

829
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:32,318
collect contaminant in any one place in

830
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,079
particular uh there's going to be very

831
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:38,039
very little contaminant on the screen

832
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,079
and most likely it'll melt right through

833
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,480
the screen and you won't have anything

834
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,519
left over there uh so that's kind of the

835
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,599
star rating system and I brought that up

836
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:49,679
here to Washington and uh uh a lot of

837
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,800
the community in the medical community

838
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,039
adopted that uh star rating system as as

839
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,119
well as uh the company that I was

840
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:00,000
working for at the time or owned at the

841
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,880
time conscious extracts so we kind of

842
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,199
push that forward here yes sir so sorry

843
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,079
this going to happen to you all oh no

844
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,199
that's great I love questions I love

845
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,160
questions um so in watching you put

846
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,199
together the bags at least for this

847
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,399
demonstration uh Pro you skipped a

848
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:20,239
couple yes and uh which you know totally

849
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:24,000
I I get how all that puts together so in

850
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:25,559
looking for a a hash at the end as far

851
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,800
as your product is concerned if you're

852
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:29,960
trying to achieve that six-star rating

853
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,079
do you feel it is absolutely always

854
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,039
necessary just use all the bags and

855
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,160
split it up

856
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:39,440
or is it is there a way to tell or is

857
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,598
there a way to at least guide you

858
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,280
towards knowing okay I can use the 73

859
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,359
and the 90 and maybe the 120 together

860
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,920
leave the 45 out or you know I mean like

861
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:54,480
how how how do you go about deciding

862
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,838
what bags you use to try to find product

863
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,920
right so so really you know I mean for

864
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:04,239
for to today's market the 502 Market um

865
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,119
I really like to have two grades

866
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:09,239
possible right um and so having a lot of

867
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,640
different bags that's kind of tough

868
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:15,439
right um but but you can also have a

869
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,078
third grade that would be all of the

870
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,720
other uh all of the other grades that

871
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,599
aren't the super melty varieties that

872
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:25,919
you compress into BR so so yes it's

873
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,318
definitely

874
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,599
uh it's defin something that that you

875
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:31,920
would want to have more screens in there

876
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,720
if you're going to try and make that

877
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,760
six-star um but really that six-star is

878
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:39,039
dependent not on the screens that you

879
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,240
use but on the material that you that

880
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,119
you have so if you have good starting

881
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:46,039
material you're going to have an amazing

882
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,920
product and if it's a five star where

883
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:49,400
you're using less of the bags you throw

884
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,119
another one in there you might pick that

885
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,000
six star um because you know because you

886
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,240
had a little bit more filtration and you

887
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,719
were able to get out a little bit more

888
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:01,519
of the contaminant um but yeah it's all

889
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:05,159
about the material the material is is

890
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:07,318
key for sure um in the

891
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:10,318
process all right well I'm going to

892
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:11,519
start this up I think it's uh probably

893
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,400
been

894
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:18,358
uh yeah it's been long enough

895
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:25,200
here so I like to

896
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:25,199
um I like to I like to uh do a 5 minute

897
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:33,239
spin got my my drill here and it's got a

898
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,759
variable speed on it so it's able to go

899
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:40,719
slow it's able to go fast and this is a

900
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:44,280
submit mixer and I really like this uh I

901
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:46,598
really like this head here it's a it's

902
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,240
rounded right so you don't have any

903
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:52,559
sharp edges sharp edges are going to

904
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:54,679
lead to breaking your material out so if

905
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,480
you've got the rounded edges it's going

906
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:57,960
to just thresh your material it's going

907
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,440
to bump into it your resin heads are

908
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,400
going to fall off and your plant

909
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,119
material is not going to break up as

910
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:08,000
much

911
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,000
so we'll give her a whirl here five

912
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,838
minutes if you guys want look you're

913
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,838
welcome to come up here and

914
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:29,039
have so uh 5 minutes of ucation and then

915
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:31,239
I'll take this and just

916
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,239
in

917
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:38,679
here I usually dump almost all of it and

918
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,760
then give a little squish to get any

919
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:45,639
resin that might be down at the

920
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,760
bottom and then I also like to keep my

921
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:51,318
bucket clean so I'll

922
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,880
usually put put some water in there and

923
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:59,000
wash out any last little

924
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:02,720
bits and then we wait again

925
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,440
so yeah yeah five more minutes um and

926
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:10,199
then I like to give it a little s um so

927
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,639
usually in practice uh it's it's either

928
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:15,559
five or it's it's either 10 or 15

929
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:18,879
minutes um I wait from the time it stops

930
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:22,199
mixing until I start pulling the bags

931
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,039
out um so tonight we'll just do the 10

932
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:27,318
minutes just to what are we waiting for

933
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:30,800
so what we're waiting for now is the res

934
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:33,440
to sink right so right now there there's

935
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,480
kind of this Matrix of plant material

936
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,280
and and ice and water and all these

937
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,960
things and the resin is denser than

938
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,079
water and so it will actually sink down

939
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,358
to the bottom and so we're waiting for

940
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,800
it to to do a little bit of sinking and

941
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:51,759
then uh then we can also give a little

942
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,318
more agitation 5 minutes later to kind

943
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,960
of mix any bits that are still stuck on

944
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,199
the plant material that have settled on

945
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,559
plant material and uh allow that to

946
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,239
drain down so

947
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:06,839
yeah any Merit to putting on a little

948
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:10,078
low vibration table I mean totally could

949
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:13,400
I've never done it before um but uh but

950
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:17,480
I you know seems like it might it might

951
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:20,318
help move things down right yeah yeah so

952
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,838
um people definitely do that with keep

953
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,318
right when they're making ke they put a

954
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,239
little vibrator on their ke screens and

955
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,759
and bounce the the resin off so you

956
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,519
don't have to break the plant material

957
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,280
up and you can kind of just you know if

958
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,920
it's cold enough room it should Shear

959
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:38,280
off really well so um I had a question

960
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,720
about uh washing machines right so

961
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,400
there's uh there's kind of two two ways

962
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,480
to go about it uh this this method you

963
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,039
know at first it was like a cake mixer

964
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,079
right that's that's what I used for

965
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:53,199
years um then we moved to the drill uh

966
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,519
with a paint mixer and the paint mixer

967
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,799
it you know it was it was good but when

968
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,199
I found the cement mixer it was just

969
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,720
that that that perfect

970
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:06,318
tool so yeah so it's kind of the

971
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,879
progression over the years but but the

972
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:11,239
uh the washing machines are are really

973
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,960
an interesting method so what you what

974
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:16,439
you do with a washing machine is you um

975
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,639
you fill the the little it's like a

976
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,480
desktop type washing machine they

977
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:23,960
actually make bigger ones as well um but

978
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,358
uh you fill it with some ice and water

979
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,240
and then you put your plant material

980
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:31,440
into a bag uh that is all the mesh

981
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:33,838
that's at the bottom of this 220 Micron

982
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,079
so it's all 220 Micron it has a zipper

983
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:40,119
on it and uh you put that into uh your

984
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,440
washing machine and just turn it on and

985
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,480
so you can set it for however many many

986
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,119
minutes you want to do your your wash

987
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,679
and then it's got a little hose and you

988
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:52,280
drain it right into your bags right so

989
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:56,159
that's definitely an easy way to do it

990
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:58,519
um I've seen similar qualities uh come

991
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,920
come from it I would say that if you're

992
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:05,000
doing the fresh Frozen um I've seen a

993
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,119
lot a lot of people have better success

994
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,838
with fresh frozen using the washing

995
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,079
machine than they have with the drill

996
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,558
right but with the dry trim it seems

997
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,160
that the drill is better for me at least

998
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:22,040
so that's kind of my personal personal

999
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:24,199
preference there um but yeah yes sir so

1000
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:26,800
I'm going to assume that you at work you

1001
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,919
probably use the like 20 gallon washers

1002
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,480
St

1003
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:36,079
um at work we do dry material there um

1004
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,838
and so we actually use this same setup

1005
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:43,160
but in 32 gallon bins um so they're

1006
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:46,078
they're just a a rubber made uh brute

1007
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:48,519
trash bins U but we actually buy the the

1008
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,400
white ones that are food grade right so

1009
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,199
they're actually it's a little higher

1010
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:57,039
quality plastic you can actually put

1011
00:45:52,199 --> 00:46:01,318
food into um and uh yeah but then we use

1012
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:03,159
the freeze dryer for the finish so so if

1013
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:06,079
I'm sorry I guess are you using the

1014
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:09,920
bigger washer machines or we we don't

1015
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,079
use a wash machine yeah the same exact

1016
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,280
same exact thing yeah I use a little bit

1017
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,800
beefier of a drill uh it work this is

1018
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,720
just like my personal home drill you

1019
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:24,119
know um but the same mixing head um I I

1020
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:26,519
use on the 20 gon set and then are you

1021
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:29,160
draining oh you're draining into a 20

1022
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:32,960
gon instead of bags yeah so I've got a

1023
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:36,399
32G uh trash bin that actually holds the

1024
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,599
20 gallon uh set of Bubble Bags just

1025
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,400
kind of that's you know the trash bin

1026
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:44,359
that works the best for for those bags

1027
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,800
and I I've seen bags that are uh that

1028
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:49,639
are side walls are all mesh or at least

1029
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,280
extended mesh would you do have you ever

1030
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:54,519
reuse those do you like those um yeah

1031
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,519
you know the the all mesh bags are

1032
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:59,960
definitely uh definitely great uh but I

1033
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:02,838
would say

1034
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,679
um yeah I just I just use the Bubble

1035
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:07,920
Bags because it's what I have and it's

1036
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:11,838
what I've used for years and and uh I

1037
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,280
really like to uh support bu man and his

1038
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:15,719
Endeavors although he doesn't really

1039
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,720
need too much of my support

1040
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:20,439
nowadays so training in the 20 gon bags

1041
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,719
is not like a big deal like I couldn't

1042
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,440
imagine trying to drain a 20 gallon

1043
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:28,919
trash can into a 5 gon uh set of bags

1044
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,720
that would take a while right

1045
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,400
so bigger bags bags does that just drain

1046
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,439
quicker yeah you know uh you're just

1047
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,280
able to hold all that water in there

1048
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,720
yeah so if you're if you're doing it

1049
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,400
into you know if you're draining your

1050
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,399
big 20 gallon washer uh you probably

1051
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,880
want a 20 gallon set of bags to hold all

1052
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,079
that water so that you can drain it all

1053
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:53,480
at once um there's also a lot of people

1054
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,519
will use another method um where they'll

1055
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,519
cut the buckets right and then they'll

1056
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:02,719
stack stack they they'll put one one bag

1057
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:05,639
in each bucket right and then stack the

1058
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:07,358
these buckets inside of each other and

1059
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:08,879
the the very bottom one they've just got

1060
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:10,920
a whole bunch of holes drilled in the

1061
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,440
bottom of it and they do it in a sink or

1062
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,240
they do it outside where it's okay for

1063
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,280
the water to just drain um or do it in

1064
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:20,919
into a big tub you know where they've

1065
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:25,040
got it kind of raised up um and then you

1066
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:28,800
could use a 20 gallon washer with a 5

1067
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:32,318
gallon bucket right so and and if you're

1068
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:36,359
using the All mesh screens there's much

1069
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:37,920
more surface area of of mesh for for

1070
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:40,279
your water to move through because

1071
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,519
that's you're moving your your hashes

1072
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,680
through it but it's also really how fast

1073
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,759
is your water going to drain through

1074
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:50,039
right so so yeah the all mesh bags are

1075
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,359
great for kind of doing that sort of a

1076
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:55,679
method where you're using the smaller

1077
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:58,039
bags but a larger washer yeah yes so if

1078
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,679
you were trying to make something for

1079
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:03,920
someone with cancer so you know usually

1080
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:06,440
I've been making the alcohol extraction

1081
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,280
M do you think because this has got more

1082
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,200
of the tpes in it it would be a better

1083
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:14,559
medicine well it just really depends I I

1084
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:19,759
would say that uh you're going to have

1085
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:22,760
um more of a strain specific effect from

1086
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:26,880
Bubble hatch right because it has all of

1087
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,359
those Turing in there um I don't really

1088
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,760
and he just he just left he'd probably

1089
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:33,598
be the the one to talk to about about

1090
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,760
that uh you know whether having

1091
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,838
something with that's full of Turpin

1092
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,319
would be better for somebody with cancer

1093
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:42,759
I'm not 100% sure I have not done enough

1094
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:46,400
studying for that but I will say that

1095
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:49,240
you really see um the modulating effects

1096
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,079
of the different strains uh the tpin

1097
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:53,279
that that are in there from Bubble has

1098
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:55,640
versus having an alcohol extract where a

1099
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,280
lot of those tpin are gone or changed

1100
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:00,318
because in the heat process

1101
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,119
They do change uh you know and break

1102
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,119
down mular so

1103
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,880
yeah yeah yeah that's the other thing so

1104
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,079
this would not be decard right so you

1105
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,039
know if you were going to eat just

1106
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:18,280
bubble has straight it would be a THC

1107
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:21,279
acid that you're consuming rather than a

1108
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,240
THC that's been converted and unless you

1109
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,798
smoked unless you smoked it and then

1110
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:27,879
during the the act of smoking it's doing

1111
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:30,000
that deep

1112
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:34,960
yeah

1113
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,960
yeah all right any other

1114
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,838
questions Jeff are we doing really well

1115
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,440
we got about a 15 minute window left is

1116
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,519
that yeah I'm going pull this and we'll

1117
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,559
we'll have it on the tray within 10

1118
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:50,039
minutes of awesome

1119
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:53,400
yeah and so I would say that uh that

1120
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:56,358
when I'm doing this uh at home uh I'm

1121
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:59,519
going to be doing four washes or at work

1122
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:02,798
uh I do four washes um I've done up to

1123
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:05,679
12 washes on certain strings and come up

1124
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:07,920
with melting material what I like to do

1125
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,480
at home is do the for washes and then

1126
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,798
take it and throw all of the plant

1127
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:15,119
material into a crock pot take some of

1128
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:17,318
this bubble water um that's left over

1129
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,119
and fill the crock pot up and throw a

1130
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:21,960
whole bunch of coconut oil into the

1131
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,880
crock pot and uh and cook that to get

1132
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,000
the remaining canono out of the plant

1133
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,960
material um so I think that's that's

1134
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,159
really a great method to get the best of

1135
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,920
both worlds you get something really

1136
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:32,679
next to smoke and you get something

1137
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,838
that's going to be very effective to eat

1138
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:35,838
as well

1139
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:48,079
so right cool well let's get going here

1140
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:48,079
on this uh

1141
00:51:52,920 --> 00:52:01,240
so I like to give a little jiggle well

1142
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,239
it's in the water just kind of uh

1143
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,440
get pull up pull some hashes out of my

1144
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,119
hand yeah I I like to to give it a

1145
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,960
little shake to get any of the resin

1146
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:17,880
that has gone down to the bottom uh to

1147
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:21,000
drain and when I'm doing my first SEC

1148
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,880
first and second uh pulls I really try

1149
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,880
to just pull it out and kind of move it

1150
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,400
around like this so that the water is

1151
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,880
draining over over the different parts

1152
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,559
of the screen and washing any of the

1153
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,960
resin heads out of there but not squeeze

1154
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,319
if you squeeze it you're going to have a

1155
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,440
lot of the plane material that has

1156
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:39,239
broken down go through there right now

1157
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,159
the pl material has floated up to the

1158
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,078
top and the resin heads have have come

1159
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:45,078
down to the bottom and so you want to

1160
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,720
try and keep that separation as much as

1161
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:51,839
you possibly can um in the third and

1162
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,279
fourth run however I I start giving it a

1163
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:55,400
little bit more of a squeeze to make

1164
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:59,760
sure that I'm getting the most out of it

1165
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:03,559
but those are lower grade um end results

1166
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,880
so um so you take your bucket come back

1167
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:10,240
over to it

1168
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:12,798
um I like to kind of stretch the bag

1169
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:12,798
back over

1170
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,599
it and then you just dump it back in

1171
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,199
there so that's that's ready to go again

1172
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:21,200
for another

1173
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:27,000
wash it's always handy to have a a nice

1174
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,000
place to

1175
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,480
set your bags as you're pulling know so

1176
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,358
another bucket uh you know set off to

1177
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,280
the side Jeff if you're going to do that

1178
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:38,838
a second time will you pick the second

1179
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,240
bucket up so everybody can see it second

1180
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:43,159
bucket the one on the floor this one

1181
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:45,159
here yeah I don't I don't know if you're

1182
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:46,639
going to do that for every wave yeah

1183
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:48,519
yeah yeah yeah well so I mean we're just

1184
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:51,039
going to do the one tonight because for

1185
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:54,039
for time but right on yeah yeah yeah

1186
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:57,239
yeah so that's that's what we've got

1187
00:53:54,039 --> 00:54:00,480
there um

1188
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:00,479
so if you were doing this for

1189
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,880
real really going to do four washes

1190
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,318
would you have that one back on ice at

1191
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,880
this point in time well it's still on

1192
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:14,199
ice and so I would pull all these bags

1193
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:17,079
still got ice yeah oh yeah there's

1194
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,078
plenty of ice in

1195
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,280
there yeah you guys I don't know can

1196
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,359
see just put on the table we'll

1197
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:34,440
yeah so it's just plain material that's

1198
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,440
been threshed a little

1199
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,920
bit so then as you pull your screens I

1200
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:43,078
like to to take the screen and fold it

1201
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,280
over like this uh it it gives you kind

1202
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:48,119
of this shape where it draws everything

1203
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,839
down into a cone down here so instead of

1204
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:55,000
it being a flat circular screen uh and

1205
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:57,119
then just give it a little dunk to make

1206
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,719
sure that you've gotten all the red

1207
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,000
that can fall through the screen uh to

1208
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:04,199
fall

1209
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
through is there an advantage to doing

1210
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:12,279
four washes as opposed to like one long

1211
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,440
wash well so so there's in the bag or

1212
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,440
when it's in the bag after you've done

1213
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,838
your mixing there's resin that's stuck

1214
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,079
on the plant material and so it kind of

1215
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:26,880
helps wash it more um so if you if you

1216
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:28,960
were to do 20 minutes say of of mixing

1217
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,680
um you're going to have the disadvantage

1218
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,519
of it's going to be broken up so you're

1219
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:34,440
going to lose that ability to have the

1220
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:36,639
higher quality resin that you pull from

1221
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,880
the very beginning of it um and you're

1222
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:42,519
going to get a little bit less so so

1223
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:46,318
every po kind of generates in quality a

1224
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:48,440
little yes yeah yeah yeah uh and andg

1225
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:51,599
grades and yield as well so there's

1226
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:55,079
going to be less and less of a

1227
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:58,519
yield but so with that being said let's

1228
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:01,920
just say the the 90 Micron that you pull

1229
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:05,480
on pole one is that not the same as the

1230
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,680
90 on pole three yeah definitely and you

1231
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,559
know I would say depending on what you

1232
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:13,279
how your material is um if there's a lot

1233
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,160
of dirt in it or you have power Milo or

1234
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:19,119
you have issues like that that first

1235
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:22,318
wash might be lower quality than the

1236
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,400
second right so uh when I'm working with

1237
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:26,759
outdoor material a lot of times I'll

1238
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,760
throw the material into the water

1239
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,280
and then without beating it up just kind

1240
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,240
of getting it all wet uh throw it in

1241
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,280
bags and and pull that out so that you

1242
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:40,000
wash off any of that

1243
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,720
dirt exactly exactly but you don't want

1244
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,920
to be you don't want to do it too much

1245
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:47,078
cuz the resin is going to fall off so

1246
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,480
but then that resin can be saved what

1247
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:52,240
you do get the dirt Pan the resin uh can

1248
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:54,000
be saved to make proc you still do that

1249
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:57,519
in like a cold

1250
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,679
water um yeah I actually don't put ice

1251
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:04,798
in there but it's like cold out of the T

1252
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:06,598
yeah right so Jeff can I ask you though

1253
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:08,440
pu with all the rains we had this year

1254
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:11,760
did you have much dirt on those flowers

1255
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:15,200
out there um you know there's definitely

1256
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,599
some dirt on the bottom pieces for sure

1257
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,759
uh that came up like Splash up yeah yeah

1258
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:23,880
so you know the cleanest microbial

1259
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,359
counts ever yeah outdoor cultivation

1260
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,798
definitely you're going to have some

1261
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:30,960
some dirt growing in dirt and the mar it

1262
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:33,639
splashes back up onto the plant so a lot

1263
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,880
of or Growers had to learn a lot of

1264
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:39,879
their crops they're not passing

1265
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,798
microbes yeah I saw the huge pile of

1266
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,240
cannabis the one grower just mountain of

1267
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:47,480
cannabis that he burned CU he's like all

1268
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:49,358
it just went to mold you know they grew

1269
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,719
so much cannabis this year they couldn't

1270
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,358
take care of it all you know and that's

1271
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,838
that's the problem with a lot of the 502

1272
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:59,078
Farms they they don't plan for

1273
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:01,798
um you know when their first startup you

1274
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:05,839
know they they don't really plan for for

1275
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:08,318
having issues like that so um so yeah

1276
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:08,318
this is

1277
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:13,679
a so the the resin will collect itself

1278
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:18,000
on the screen I like to give a little

1279
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:20,399
wash to uh it does it does a couple

1280
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,920
things it gets it all down into into the

1281
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,160
center of the screen but it

1282
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:28,559
also washes away some of the smaller

1283
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:32,440
particles that you haven't gotten out of

1284
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:36,039
there and it also washes this water that

1285
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:37,358
is basically a canvas tea it washes that

1286
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:40,640
out of the product so it gives you a

1287
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:42,838
little bit cleaner of a product um but

1288
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:46,279
in practice it you know I would use a

1289
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:49,000
pump sprayer like a agricultural sprayer

1290
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,240
with ice so it's going to be cold cold

1291
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,679
water that you're spraying in here just

1292
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:55,239
toight are you just spraying around the

1293
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:56,558
inside of the bag or are you actually

1294
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:58,679
like trying to

1295
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,798
material yeah you're you're really

1296
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:03,279
spraying the the resin itself yeah yeah

1297
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:06,798
so

1298
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,839
um come around you guys can peer in here

1299
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:10,838
and

1300
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:10,838
see

1301
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,880
yeah up first

1302
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:29,879
he's not

1303
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:03,000
a little

1304
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
more

1305
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:11,599
yeah well the secondary wash is going to

1306
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:12,760
be not quite the same amount right so so

1307
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,318
you

1308
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:20,000
know I would I'd say it's it's more than

1309
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:23,279
half the amount you would get you know

1310
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,719
half again you know um but um but yeah

1311
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,200
it's diminishing your yield will

1312
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:30,639
diminish as you go but you will recover

1313
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:32,719
substantial M more by washing it again

1314
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:35,960
oh yeah definitely okay so what I like

1315
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:38,480
to do is uh you know at least at home is

1316
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,599
kind of put it over a bucket like this

1317
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,039
and create suction so I'm I'm just

1318
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:45,359
drawing the water through the screen by

1319
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,799
pulling down on it um you can also use

1320
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:50,639
these pressing screens um but for this

1321
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:53,480
small amount I'm just going to use this

1322
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:57,920
uh this method here and

1323
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,920
so um so you take your

1324
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:26,838
good describe what you're doing yeah so

1325
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:28,920
so so I'm just scraping the uh

1326
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:32,119
there did you get

1327
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,119
some that's

1328
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,760
free yeah so so so what I'm doing is

1329
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:40,760
just scraping it off of the screen of

1330
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,880
the

1331
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:47,119
spoon and uh and then putting it into

1332
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:49,798
the S and then I'll just work it here uh

1333
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,798
work it through the

1334
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,880
S that's just to to help it dry this is

1335
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,559
to break it up yeah exactly so that it

1336
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,318
doesn't dry in a

1337
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,640
clump when you do an alcohol instruction

1338
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:09,038
and you put it through the coffee filter

1339
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:11,639
you up a whole bunch of the stocks of

1340
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:15,680
the tripon yeah is there any value to

1341
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:17,679
those you think well you know I'm not

1342
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:19,038
going to say no because I believe that

1343
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:23,038
all parts of the canab plant are

1344
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:26,799
valuable but for consumption uh to get

1345
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:29,599
you high I would say probably not very

1346
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:30,960
it's going to be I I couldn't really say

1347
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:35,079
for sure because I haven't done the

1348
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,079
research to be able to to to

1349
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:40,159
tell yeah but but I would say you know

1350
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:43,038
what what you have there is the stocks

1351
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:44,480
you also have the the rosette of gland

1352
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,400
cells which is like kind of the

1353
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,719
manufacturing plant for all the Turin

1354
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,119
and cannaboids inside the Rosen head so

1355
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:54,199
that's going to be there you know that

1356
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:57,200
that's kind of what what you have there

1357
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:57,199
yeah

1358
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:03,199
you find using a smaller is easier than

1359
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:05,239
using a larger one this little Sie I

1360
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:07,078
would not use in practice I would

1361
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:09,679
actually use a little bit larger of one

1362
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:11,480
cuz it's it's much easier to deal with

1363
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:14,639
but this is what I could

1364
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:20,199
grab you know uh I actually use this uh

1365
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:23,519
my favorite s is one from uh is one from

1366
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:26,879
Ikea it's called the idealist and so

1367
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:30,880
it's like about this big you can a kilo

1368
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,519
of res into the thing and S so yeah when

1369
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,838
you're when you're scaling up and doing

1370
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:35,838
a lot larger it's yeah it's it's kind of

1371
01:03:34,838 --> 01:03:39,440
the way to

1372
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:41,199
go yeah so then I just take the bag off

1373
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,760
and there's there's a little bit of

1374
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:47,038
resin left on there but not too terribly

1375
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,079
much I just come over here and give it a

1376
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:52,079
little wash this water's really cold so

1377
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:54,119
it's going to help aid getting it uh out

1378
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,720
of there

1379
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:57,720
and there we go

1380
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:04,000
so over here this looks fairly good I'm

1381
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:07,358
just going to kind of it up just a

1382
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:12,318
little bit really quick and uh all of

1383
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:15,199
the uh tools I use this brush on uh so

1384
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:16,599
you can just brush the any of the resin

1385
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:19,278
that's going to stick to it and if you

1386
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:21,599
brush it off right away it doesn't stick

1387
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:23,239
so much to the card that you can't get

1388
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,359
it all off otherwise it's going to cake

1389
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:30,239
up it's just gets nasty but you can keep

1390
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:32,400
your tools pretty clean uh by using that

1391
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:37,598
um yeah so

1392
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:43,039
then the 45 Micron so 73 is generally

1393
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:45,880
going to be your um highest rate right

1394
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:49,240
most cannabis plants produce a a trome

1395
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:54,079
head that that falls in that 73 Micron

1396
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:57,519
and above uh State um there are a lot of

1397
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:59,880
sativas that have smaller resin heads

1398
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:01,838
and there's a lot of you know different

1399
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:05,278
different varieties that have larger

1400
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:07,519
resin heads but kind of you know as as a

1401
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:10,400
cross-section of of the size of resin

1402
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:13,318
heads out there uh the 73 seems to be a

1403
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:16,240
really good screen to capture the when

1404
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:20,000
you say the 73 is generally the the

1405
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:22,879
better of them what is it about the that

1406
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,358
that's better it like the more Turin or

1407
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,920
more more res and higher THC or

1408
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:32,159
um well okay so when you're washing it

1409
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:34,159
uh you're adding contaminant as well as

1410
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:37,159
freeing the you're freeing contaminant

1411
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:39,838
and freeing resin heads and so if you if

1412
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:42,118
you're taking the the fraction that has

1413
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,318
the most resin heads present in the

1414
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:47,318
plant material you're going to have the

1415
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:49,278
least amount of contaminant right so you

1416
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:52,079
you're you're able to have a higher

1417
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:57,639
quality product just because you've got

1418
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:57,640
more resin that was in the plant yeah so

1419
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:02,440
you mentioned cuticles before and their

1420
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:05,519
thickness uh how big of a role does that

1421
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:08,559
have in like helping to get off uh the

1422
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:11,798
the the the head of the um the stock

1423
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:14,039
without damaging it or opening it yeah I

1424
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:18,278
mean it's it's definitely huge uh you

1425
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:21,520
know um some resin even when it's really

1426
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:24,599
really cold uh is going to be cemented

1427
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:28,838
to the stock you know and so it's going

1428
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:31,880
to be really hard thresh it away um and

1429
01:06:28,838 --> 01:06:33,599
you know it's it's just you just kind of

1430
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,640
you've got to work with your material

1431
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,599
find out if it's a if it's worthwhile to

1432
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:41,199
to process that type of material with

1433
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:43,720
that method and if it's not send it over

1434
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:46,759
into a solvent category do you find like

1435
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:49,078
more ease in with certain types like

1436
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:51,680
like a sativa do you find more a thinner

1437
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:54,119
cell wall so it's easier to manipulate

1438
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:57,159
over an Inda or yeah I mean I would say

1439
01:06:54,119 --> 01:07:01,480
like AF guy is is one of my very

1440
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:03,719
favorite strains um and it it it just

1441
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,599
the resin Flies free from the plant

1442
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:07,919
material and it's also really cake thin

1443
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:11,200
resin um but that's also one of those

1444
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,318
streams that I've run up to 12 times and

1445
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,838
uh on the 12th run it was still a three

1446
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:17,838
star so it was very much worth it for me

1447
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:20,000
to do that but I was just tired at the

1448
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:20,000
end

1449
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:27,599
of yeah hash

1450
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:29,278
muscles he je yes if you did run up to

1451
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,160
that situation could you just let the

1452
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:35,798
marijuana sit overnight in cold water in

1453
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:35,798
the fridge or something and start

1454
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:44,720
over you know I I wouldn't I I would not

1455
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:46,760
recommend soaking it for too long um I

1456
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:49,959
think that there's going to be

1457
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,799
some I I I don't have any definitive

1458
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,720
proof but but I believe that there's

1459
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:56,199
going to be some amount of water that's

1460
01:07:53,719 --> 01:08:00,519
going to come into the resin head itself

1461
01:07:56,199 --> 01:08:03,000
and kind of moisturize that resin and so

1462
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:06,079
I think the 30 minutes of soaking is is

1463
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,960
kind of where you want to be yeah kind

1464
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,798
of on the side of that cuz I have done

1465
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,519
that basically people been like oh I got

1466
01:08:09,798 --> 01:08:13,278
to go to bed I can't do it you know

1467
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:15,358
right uh when you come back the next

1468
01:08:13,278 --> 01:08:17,359
morning even if you got tons of ice in

1469
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:19,318
there your plant material is just going

1470
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:22,319
to be mush and then if you run it again

1471
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:24,159
you're going to have so much like excess

1472
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,440
uh contaminant like what we talking

1473
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:28,759
about right the pl material is going to

1474
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:28,759
break

1475
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:37,640
up this one I pulled just a little bit W

1476
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:40,480
than the first one so you can kind of

1477
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:42,719
see what not to

1478
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:44,639
do you want to have an amount of

1479
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,600
moisture in there um but you don't want

1480
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,798
to have too much moisture in there or

1481
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,600
else it just kind of cakes together you

1482
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:53,920
can see that the pieces that did go

1483
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:57,199
through the SI um on the second part are

1484
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,199
more clumped together that's not ideal

1485
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,879
right so you want to be more free free

1486
01:09:00,198 --> 01:09:02,879
pieces

1487
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,600
there

1488
01:09:14,198 --> 01:09:17,198
so

1489
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
yeah yeah

1490
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:36,358
um yeah it can bit but it more just

1491
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:36,358
smears ground

1492
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:53,480
it's and again just rinse the

1493
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,039
bags you know after after you're done

1494
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:58,559
it's I can't say it enough it's very

1495
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:00,079
important to to wash your bags when

1496
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,320
you're totally done with the process to

1497
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:05,158
keep them in the best condition you can

1498
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:08,439
with ISO or water um if there's resin

1499
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:12,519
stuck on the screen uh use on the screen

1500
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:14,839
itself uh isopropyl alcohol is great um

1501
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:17,800
but uh usually just water is is what I

1502
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:21,480
like to work with so get

1503
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:23,039
strong if use warm water melt on and

1504
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:24,319
it's going to melt on there then you're

1505
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:28,279
going to need

1506
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:31,079
some water exactly thank you yeah if you

1507
01:10:28,279 --> 01:10:33,759
uh yeah and so when you're draining the

1508
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:36,039
last bag it's a little slow you can kind

1509
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,520
of give it a little up and down jerk

1510
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:40,319
like that uh but gentle don't go too

1511
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,400
much if you're doing it on the big 20

1512
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,439
gallons I don't suggest that there's a

1513
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,399
whole another method that you would use

1514
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:48,678
but uh because it can rip the screen

1515
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,319
doing this um but this this will free

1516
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:53,039
the resin heads that are clogging the

1517
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:54,880
screen get them back into the water

1518
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:57,238
allow for more of the water to drain

1519
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,239
more

1520
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:10,560
l so that's the 25 yeah this is the 25

1521
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:13,158
micron here would you consider that to

1522
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:16,560
be the Lesser qualties some of the

1523
01:11:13,158 --> 01:11:18,000
other um well just it just depends I

1524
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:22,159
would say on this

1525
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:25,399
stream possibly um what I what I ran

1526
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:28,759
yesterday was a bunch of stas and the 25

1527
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:33,479
mic was actually really nice so um the

1528
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:36,400
73 was still my highest grade um but uh

1529
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:38,759
but it was it definitely still melted um

1530
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:41,519
I think the 25 is great

1531
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:43,520
rosin rosin's my answer for anything

1532
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:47,239
that doesn't

1533
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:49,840
know what is r roson is a a method of

1534
01:11:47,238 --> 01:11:53,119
heat pressure

1535
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,920
extraction and uh and and what what you

1536
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:57,880
do is you basically take

1537
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,600
a heat Source a lot of people like at

1538
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:03,400
home can use like a a flat iron like

1539
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:06,600
straight a hair straightener um and you

1540
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:08,799
use parchment and you take the hashish

1541
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,960
you put it into a screen you fold that

1542
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,440
over uh and then you've got it in

1543
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,239
between a piece of parchment and you

1544
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:18,759
take the hair straightener and squish it

1545
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:21,158
and the liquefiable contents is the

1546
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,560
canono the tpin some of the waxes some

1547
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:25,879
other constituents that are inside of

1548
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,440
the Rosen will move outside screen and

1549
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:31,239
you can collect them and all the

1550
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:33,519
contaminant the the non mty uh parts of

1551
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:36,759
of of the hashish will stay in the

1552
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:42,639
screen okay so yeah so it's a way to

1553
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:42,639
make a hash oil okay without sof

1554
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:04,079
and I also like to kind of give this

1555
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:08,079
little tug well draining or while while

1556
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:09,800
I'm scraping so keep it from being wet

1557
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:11,920
there's moisture on the other side of

1558
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,360
the screen and moment you stop pulling

1559
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,440
on that and creating the suction the

1560
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:16,439
moisture breaks right back

1561
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:27,119
in National Geographic over

1562
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,119
here Farm

1563
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:36,560
interesting National can

1564
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,560
graphic to an end

1565
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:42,000
that yeah so this one just all really

1566
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,480
stuck to the screen so if you didn't

1567
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,520
have this little brush technique you'd

1568
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:52,198
be like oh jeez what do I do with all

1569
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:52,199
that but the brush it'll get it right

1570
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:57,039
off so [ __ ]

1571
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,679
so when you're drying your hat are you

1572
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:07,439
just drying the water that you basically

1573
01:14:02,679 --> 01:14:11,000
added to that dry PL or is there somehow

1574
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:14,919
now like water somak into the membrane

1575
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,399
of the resin or like how does that work

1576
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,399
you're you're really drying the water

1577
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:22,599
that you put in there on the outside of

1578
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:25,599
the yeah well the reason why

1579
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,800
I just because

1580
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,800
stuff I'm not going to get there some

1581
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:35,320
people advocate for like a 3 Monon

1582
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:36,880
drying time yeah well you know that

1583
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:38,599
that's definitely going to going to dry

1584
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,159
your resin more you're going to have

1585
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:44,920
more tarpine Lots cu the Tarpin will

1586
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:47,439
migrate out of the resin head um so yeah

1587
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:49,800
but but I'd say that you know the

1588
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:51,479
fresher you can smoke it the more tpine

1589
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,560
content you're going to have in there

1590
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:57,000
just as long as you're sure you got that

1591
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,000
yeah as long as it's going to be Shelf

1592
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:04,319
yeah so there you have it bubble

1593
01:15:08,198 --> 01:15:13,799
hatch all right cool now if you were

1594
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:13,799
doing

1595
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:20,239
this maybe three questions would you

1596
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:22,799
repeat this then three more times yes

1597
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:24,079
and and how much more would you get uh

1598
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,480
based on what you get there would you

1599
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:28,880
get 50% more

1600
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:31,319
yeah at least at least um so you know

1601
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,840
you stared with 133 gr what are you

1602
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:37,359
going to end up with there so generally

1603
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,880
you're going to have it between five and

1604
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:42,799
you know the highest I've ever had was

1605
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:44,319
177% on that after E Street um so from

1606
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,199
from your original plant materials

1607
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:49,198
weight you'll have 5% um on kind of the

1608
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:52,000
low end I've had a little bit less than

1609
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:53,399
5% as well um but it just kind depends

1610
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,359
on the starting

1611
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:58,839
material yeah are you going to reuse the

1612
01:15:56,359 --> 01:16:01,960
water that's in that bucket now I would

1613
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:04,360

1616
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:12,560
actually fermented it with h I've added

1617
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:12,559
