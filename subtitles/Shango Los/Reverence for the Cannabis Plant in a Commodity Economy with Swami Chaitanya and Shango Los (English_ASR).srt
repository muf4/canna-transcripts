1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,480
so Swami thank you so much for having us

2
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:12,468
on the farm today it's so beautiful here

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,528
one of the things I wanted to ask you

4
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:17,329
while I was here is about the reverence

5
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:19,579
and the spirituality in the plant

6
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:22,219
because as Kansas becomes more

7
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:25,099
normalized and and rulemaking and

8
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:26,538
bureaucracies become more involved a lot

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,990
of people are seeing cannabis more as a

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:32,629
as a commodity as a widget as a as a

11
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:34,399
thing to market and get out and a lot of

12
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:36,920
people are you know hitting vape pens

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,989
and kind of getting a little farther

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,640
away from the planet and so I was

15
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:42,649
curious to hear your thoughts because

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,429
you know in the in the early days during

17
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:49,819
Prohibition those who used cannabis were

18
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:51,409
were a group that they knew each other

19
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:53,449
and it was something that we did kind of

20
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:56,030
a need in secret to stay out of trouble

21
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:57,649
and so it was it was kind of easier to

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,989
have the reverence for the plant because

23
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,600
there was already this level of shared

24
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:05,359
we could get in trouble together vibe to

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,950
it but now with it more common and you

26
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,260
know people making jokes of it about it

27
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,500
on television TV shows and stuff the

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,150
feeling is changing but there's a lot of

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,969
value in the reverence for the plant so

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,469
as a you know a spiritual teacher and

31
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:19,909
someone with like history like yours I

32
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:21,980
thought you might have something to

33
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,719
share with us about what what you see

34
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,020
looking forward as far as the reverence

35
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:29,179
of the plant goes well your first the

36
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:31,729
point of reference is basically well I

37
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,280
talked about also which is the shared

38
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:37,909
risk that we had and in the old days

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,609
that someone just smoking a joint on the

40
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,489
street could get you know 3 5 who knows

41
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:46,280
how many years and a grower likewise

42
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:48,890
would be vulnerable and so this was a

43
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,239
share and it was a secret society as you

44
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,579
said so a grower up here in the

45
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,429
mountains would only need to know maybe

46
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:57,379
one or two you know dealers at the most

47
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,210
who would come up and the dealer in

48
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:01,519
those days would come smoke a joint and

49
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:02,899
buy your whole crop but your whole crop

50
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,549
wasn't very big either because you were

51
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,800
growing under the bushes but nonetheless

52
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,719
it was just his trust and so on and that

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,728
dealer would go back to the city or

54
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,439
would go to New York where it was and

55
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,139
they only needed to know three or four

56
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,539
sub dealers right and that sub dealer

57
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:19,040
needed to know 10 or 12 people so this

58
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:21,139
was kind of like a

59
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,048
that no one had to really know very many

60
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:26,000
people at all so that's also a way the

61
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:27,590
risk of getting busted even though it

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,908
was shared what was reduced in a

63
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,549
sentence because there weren't any

64
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:33,169
outsiders right and I like to sometimes

65
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:35,569
compare it to the Harry Potter world

66
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:38,030
right that in the midst of the American

67
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:40,009
Society in those years there was a whole

68
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,959
other subculture in counterculture we

69
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:43,759
talked about but these were people who

70
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,829
were right every there with you but

71
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,459
invisible in the sense that they all

72
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:50,900
smoke pot right and so and that was a

73
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,239
whole sort of thing is that there was a

74
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,700
kind of secret Club that you recognized

75
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,469
and you knew that someone was a STONER

76
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:59,298
they were ahead as we used to say the

77
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,859
old days and that that was sort of this

78
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:02,688
like understanding that now we

79
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:04,400
communicated on that down a different

80
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:08,168
level there was something magic about it

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,789
and also the idea that the the action of

82
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:14,599
ingesting cannabis alters your

83
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:17,449
consciousness right and so it makes you

84
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,699
more sensory aware but not just your

85
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:22,250
five senses but your sixth sense also

86
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,198
gets stimulated with cannabis and you

87
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,769
have to remember that this whole growth

88
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:30,469
of cannabis in the United States and

89
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,509
also to Graceland Europe it was already

90
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:33,919
in in them in the black community and or

91
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:36,078
the african-american community and in

92
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,969
the Latin community but the white

93
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,099
community didn't have it yet right

94
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,989
and through jazz and rock and roll all

95
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:45,679
of a sudden all the hippies became part

96
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:47,449
of the secret society and so there was a

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,979
whole kind of understanding that wow

98
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:50,419
there was these other groups too and

99
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:53,269
we're getting it from Mexico and

100
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:55,430
Colombia and that sort of thing so where

101
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,169
does the reverence come the reverence

102
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,919
comes partly from this secret society

103
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:03,560
and from the actual effect that cannabis

104
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,299
has it heightens your awareness it and

105
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,459
the other thing we had this ritual of

106
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,049
passing the joints alright and that's

107
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,479
getting less and less now is everyone

108
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:14,299
has their own vague pan and things like

109
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,879
and people don't really pass the bong so

110
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:19,069
much it's one hit but whatever we had

111
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,348
this whole ritual of passing that joint

112
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:25,370
and the risk everyone had just to get it

113
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:27,740
there yeah and not be found out and to

114
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,848
share it so and then the idea in the

115
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,300
hippy community for sure was this was an

116
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:35,689
inspirational device

117
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,699
an inspirational substance and we didn't

118
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:41,389
smoke it to get healthy we didn't smoke

119
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:43,670
it to know we smoke to get high and we

120
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:47,419
smoked it to get high to be inspired and

121
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:50,569
to be inspired to paint or make music or

122
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,449
draw or perhaps inspired to climb a tree

123
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,920
or make a beautiful meal or embroider a

124
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,050
piece of thing or build your house

125
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,140
whatever all those things became a

126
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,520
different activity once you were once

127
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,069
you were elevated through through

128
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,319
cannabis inhalation and so this became a

129
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:08,990
point of this was again a shared

130
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,959
consciousness on what we would call it

131
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,360
the sixth chakra that people had through

132
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,310
their sixth chakra more of a telepathic

133
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,560
kind of understanding and then you throw

134
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,949
in the rock concerts of course where you

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,930
have clouds of smoke and tribalism it's

136
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,349
exactly that thing and that through

137
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,449
dance and the music people then express

138
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,100
their relationships with one another and

139
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,289
like on a dance floor this is

140
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,600
traditional tribal as well that on the

141
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,660
dance floor you can dance flirt with

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,129
anyone right and so the people then you

143
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,590
know have an encounter with some other

144
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:44,839
partner in the dance floor and in the

145
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:46,219
rock-and-roll world and or you could

146
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,539
just dance with your partner and do a

147
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,840
whole sort of thing but this was an

148
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:53,090
expression in a way that we were unable

149
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,519
to express before dancing in the streets

150
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:59,209
was something that that the hippie tribe

151
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,549
brought back right and so the reverence

152
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:05,709
partly came also from the people way up

153
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:08,569
in the mountains and that growing a plan

154
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:10,849
is a magical experience no matter what

155
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,379
it is you know I mean even many people

156
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,510
just growing their house plants do you

157
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:16,519
have a real connection with your house

158
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:18,649
plan and your watering and so and then

159
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,539
you realize well that you know marginata

160
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,789
doesn't do so well in that corner so you

161
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,230
move it to another place and all of a

162
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,700
sudden that's really in a different

163
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,100
plant now so you've got this

164
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:32,269
communication with your plant and when

165
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:34,310
you go out into a cannabis garden full

166
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:36,319
moon in the middle of the night all

167
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,780
right and you're inhaling this sort of

168
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,819
because that's when also the plants put

169
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,789
out all kinds of I believe it's oxygen

170
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:43,349
they put out at night

171
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,330
something like that so you're just in

172
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,480
the garden and you're surrounded by this

173
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:51,120
this living atmosphere that this

174
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,040
greenness is exuding all around you and

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,870
up here in the mountains you're getting

176
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,750
the air filtered by the Douglas fir and

177
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,699
the Oaks and so on and so it's a whole

178
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:04,230
sort of mystical experience just to be

179
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:06,199
out there and then the people back in

180
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:09,000
the mountains sometimes on a wood stove

181
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,250
making these kind of witch's brews right

182
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,930
of well let's have some cannabis and

183
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,269
then throw in some comfrey you know we

184
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,709
got st. John's wort and mob and all

185
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,930
these things and then make up these

186
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:20,579
preparations and they put it into a

187
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,650
salve and all of a sudden everybody

188
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,379
around us thing that really works you

189
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:27,709
know and so well what happened here this

190
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:30,569
is sort of like this is how comedic

191
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:32,489
healing is mystical exactly right then

192
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:35,040
this goes back to ancient tradition the

193
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,990
Druids and with the Druids it was the

194
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,700
women who were the herbalist and so on

195
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,620
and so that's kind of what's happened up

196
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,449
here too is it's so many of the people

197
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,610
in the backwoods here have been

198
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,139
herbalist you know collecting from right

199
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,300
around here everything you need is

200
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:51,149
growing right around here for whatever

201
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,520
health purpose you need you know plus in

202
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:56,429
our garden we grow arnica and echinacea

203
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,759
and various other we grow a few Indian

204
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,400
herbs too but the mystical part now it's

205
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,879
interesting because we've been working

206
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,069
on this for a while when I do my plants

207
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,860
I just explained to you before when I do

208
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:12,389
my plants I take the seeds and I put

209
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,330
them at the foot of the goddess of

210
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:17,879
cannabis ganja bah and there's a special

211
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,620
mantra I say and then when I put the

212
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,439
seeds in the ground to sprout them I

213
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,120
take a dropper and I put a drop of water

214
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,850
from the sacred Ganges River in India

215
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,860
onto each seed all right and I say the

216
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:33,899
mantra so already we're starting the

217
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:39,149
what should we call the the inoculation

218
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:41,789
of the spiritual intent on to the the

219
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:44,309
seeds then it's got sacred water and

220
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,709
this is for spiritual healing physical

221
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:48,289
healing and for inspiration and it's

222
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,500
also a communal gesture

223
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:53,990
and over the years people began to see

224
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,820
how magic this plant was because it it

225
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,399
just did all these things for you it's

226
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:03,290
the most beneficial plant now there's a

227
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:06,829
group that I'm part of which is a group

228
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:09,559
called Kannamma stay namaste is an

229
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,720
Indian Sanskrit word which means I

230
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:14,479
salute the divine in you and so we made

231
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,970
a Kannamma state I salute the divine in

232
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,889
cannabis and the divine in you that you

233
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:24,019
share with it and so this is founded by

234
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:26,120
Chris Conrad and Mickey Norris who are

235
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,740
long-term activists in the cannabis

236
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,870
movement just wonderful wonderful people

237
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:34,450
and we've gotten to know them over the

238
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:38,929
years and Chris at one point wrote this

239
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:41,570
cannabis Creed for cannabis church and

240
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:44,120
so when we get together about once a

241
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,610
month or so about well first it was 10

242
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,259
now it's about 3035 of us we get

243
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,659
together and we gather we get in a

244
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:53,029
circle and well first of all everybody

245
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:55,069
brings a little bit of flower cannabis

246
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:57,740
flower we may go join up everybody's

247
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:01,610
contribution and we get a cone this big

248
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,220
and we just fill it and so in the

249
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,169
beginning of the ceremony we passed this

250
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,090
joint around everybody there so

251
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:11,839
everybody smokes of the sacrament and

252
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:15,139
then we repeat the cannabis Creed and

253
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,740
there are various other parts of ritual

254
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:20,929
sequence that were perfecting - now

255
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,580
Christmas point of view for this is that

256
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:25,609
he's always been about getting people

257
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,920
out of jail because they use cannabis

258
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,930
for health purposes whatever he's got

259
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,459
many people out of jail testifying as an

260
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:34,579
expert not a lawyer because an expert

261
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,740
witness in courtroom so he came up with

262
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,740
this inspiration then he said well

263
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,169
actually this could be a way to get

264
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,659
people out of jail that say I belong to

265
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:46,519
the cannabis Church the sacrament says I

266
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:49,250
have to smoke it to be part of the

267
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,779
church and someone else is part of the

268
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,779
church and they grow it and so on but

269
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:56,059
it's essential part of the ceremony that

270
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,319
you had like with a peyote Church if

271
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:58,969
you're not taking the peyote

272
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,699
don't think he can be part of the peyote

273
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,579
Church and so this would then likewise

274
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:07,250
be a plausible defense for someone in a

275
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:08,659
state where it's not legal to say that

276
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,339
look I've been a member of the cannabis

277
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:10,939
church for so long I've been doing this

278
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,410
for so long

279
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,709
nobody insects and all of a sudden they

280
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:17,360
get busted I'm part of the church but in

281
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,948
order to be a religion you have to say

282
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,740
well a religion has this this this and

283
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:24,349
this so we say okay can i mistake we've

284
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,600
got this this this and this so we are

285
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,120
religion and then we get back to the

286
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,528
First Amendment that says Congress can't

287
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,240
make any laws about religion all right

288
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:36,740
it's not that you have freedom religion

289
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,889
it's just says that Congress can't make

290
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,389
laws about it and essentially that's

291
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:45,009
supposed to mean you have freedom of

292
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:48,100
religion right so as far as the

293
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:52,579
spirituality that's innate in the plan

294
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:56,180
that's what actually initiates and

295
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:59,208
facilitates the healing and then we find

296
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:01,759
out we have endocannabinoids interior

297
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:04,159
cannabinoids and that they're kind of

298
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,870
exactly luck and the one we know is now

299
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,778
called Ananda mind all right

300
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,149
now who came up with that name some

301
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:14,539
stone doubt scientists because you know

302
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:18,679
when Ananda my means Ananda is an

303
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:22,698
unbelievably beautiful significant

304
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:27,099
Sanskrit word which is translated most

305
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:31,370
often as bliss and the divine essence

306
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:36,560
even though it's one indivisible is seen

307
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:41,659
as sat-chit-ananda being consciousness

308
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:44,268
bliss so what can be described about the

309
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:46,639
ultimate isness of consciousness

310
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:50,019
whatever way you want to describe the

311
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,129
ultimate divinity in sanskrit is called

312
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,159
sat-chit-ananda as the famous guru

313
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:57,809
course

314
00:12:53,159 --> 00:13:02,338
but suck is is being cheat is

315
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:05,338
consciousness and Ananda is bliss right

316
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:08,790
and so the Bliss molecule that we have

317
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:10,709
in our brains is part of the thing

318
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,990
that's the receptor for cannabinoids in

319
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:15,568
your brain and then Ananda mite is the

320
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,100
one that gives you that good feeling and

321
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:18,659
they're certain scientists were

322
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,740
beginning to say in the medical world

323
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:26,219
that we need to investigate an under my

324
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,899
the name of that seatback can have an

325
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,720
endocannabinoid molecule another mine

326
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:34,019
that perhaps many conditions our result

327
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,879
of an under my deficient signal the

328
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:40,889
Bliss Monica you don't have enough up

329
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:43,980
and so particularly THC then comes in

330
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:47,909
and augments your your endocannabinoid

331
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:52,938
and an amide in order to bring back the

332
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:58,769
Bliss in your body and bliss being a

333
00:13:52,938 --> 00:14:02,309
divine attribute that it is that

334
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:06,110
essential divinity and the plant which

335
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:09,000
is being transmitted that the THC then

336
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:12,899
augments the deficiency of the among the

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,578
mind and so you chill out I just a

338
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,519
friend of mine who just was here came to

339
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:19,469
visit and he's got five daughters right

340
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,179
and it's wife and and they have a

341
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,879
wonderful household and they're all

342
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:26,099
cheerleaders not the wife but the five

343
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,750
daughters and one announced for the

344
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,269
Minnesota Vikings and so and they've won

345
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,789
cheering championships all over let me

346
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,919
take it seriously

347
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,480
two times that group is one that I guess

348
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,669
I know it's the World Championship

349
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,620
whatever right but he had one daughter

350
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,240
who was always so hyper and always kind

351
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,429
of mean and always kind of there was

352
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,829
dust to deal with and so on and then

353
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:48,568
finally when she got old enough you see

354
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:51,750
now I've got a hold of a vape pen which

355
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:53,909
was and all of a sudden she just chills

356
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,769
out and her life is so much easier and

357
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:58,049
she gets so long with her brother with

358
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,959
all her sisters and so on and it was

359
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:02,969
like the the replacement of the

360
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,449
deficient anonymize that's my theory

361
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,090
sure sure

362
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,759
but that that was the idea that this she

363
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,360
needed more blessing in life and so many

364
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:16,120
conditions of our life of stress can be

365
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,779
alleviated through a little tiny puff of

366
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,850
bliss and so that's part of how we see

367
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:24,100
the inner workings of the divine

368
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,110
workings that and that's how doctors

369
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,000
actually got into it they said okay we

370
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,779
have this molecule in our body which is

371
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,429
a receptor for cannabinoids they didn't

372
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,860
find the cannabinoids first yeah no they

373
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:38,500
found the receptor what fits in here why

374
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,240
would that be there and then they said

375
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,340
well if that's there the body itself

376
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,779
must produce something that goes there

377
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,970
because it wouldn't just produce if it

378
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,829
had to come from outside the body that

379
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,660
was the theory in it so then they say

380
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,420
okay this stuff fits it what is that

381
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:54,459
stuff well that looks exactly like this

382
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,559
other stuff we already know the XOR

383
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,800
phyto as they call it vital cannabinoids

384
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,449
and so they said wow this is an amazing

385
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,609
thing now they're beginning to say

386
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,850
because there's the other one too - GA

387
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,980
is the other endocannabinoid and that

388
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,320
one is out through the rest of the body

389
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,840
and apparently virtually all your body

390
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,700
organs have cannabinoids in them so much

391
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,730
so that people are beginning to say that

392
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,650
like the ensemble in the smoke there's

393
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,139
an ensemble in your body of the

394
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,850
connectivity of the endocannabinoids so

395
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:27,669
the endocannabinoids within your body

396
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,170
are a messaging system between all the

397
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:31,419
organs between the kidney and the liver

398
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:33,360
the whole thing so there's actually

399
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:38,169
saying like there's a you know

400
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,690
circulation system a nervous system a

401
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:44,379
lymphatic system and now some people are

402
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:46,840
saying was actually my system which is

403
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:49,299
the feedback loop the feedback loop

404
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,750
within the nervous system so this has

405
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:54,490
got a lot of medical people very excited

406
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,379
and it's also got the pharmaceuticals

407
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,820
really scared because if you can grow

408
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,799
the world's best medicine in your

409
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,170
backyard and that's another thing I

410
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:03,579
always like to say about this I don't

411
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:05,769
know if you know any people on a paleo

412
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,480
diet right that's your big popular thing

413
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:09,099
well whenever you see them again you

414
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,730
make sure you tell them if you're on a

415
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:14,649
paleo about your medicine is cannabis

416
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,299
that's all you had right

417
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,180
maybe it has some you know what do they

418
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:22,009
call it white willow bark which is kind

419
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,799
of like aspirin or something you had all

420
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:27,470
the other herbs but to go to one for

421
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,599
every case who's always going to be your

422
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,980
cannabis right and so if you're a paleo

423
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:36,529
diet that's what you guys so so if a lot

424
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,599
of the reverence and spirituality that

425
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:41,269
we experienced from the plant was

426
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,919
because he was prohibited and we did it

427
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:45,410
together in small ceremonies and

428
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,960
nowadays it's becoming more commodified

429
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:50,210
with pens do you think that the the new

430
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,940
folks getting into cannabis was likely

431
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,250
to have that shared reference is that

432
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,720
knit instead of just saying I think so I

433
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,700
have a lot of faith in our younger

434
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,519
generation I know an awful lot of young

435
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,080
people are really into flowers okay

436
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,369
they're dabs in a peasant song but

437
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:09,829
there's a whole group of people and well

438
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:11,569
take the idea number two buck chuck yeah

439
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:13,490
right totally dollars for a bottle of

440
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:15,139
wine right and also noise people never

441
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,630
drank wine before are drinking wine and

442
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,580
the big guys the fancy the twenty dollar

443
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,350
bond bottle guys you know the Joseph

444
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:23,240
Heights and whatever they say oh god

445
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:24,829
it's the end of the world nope but then

446
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,319
three years later all of their sales

447
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:28,879
went up because you got a $2.00 bottle

448
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:30,409
on a it's your girlfriend's purse let's

449
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,330
bring five bucks you know Chandra verse

450
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,060
ten pretty soon you saying what's the

451
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:37,849
real stuff taste yeah in the same thing

452
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:40,970
with canvas they pen convenient discreet

453
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:43,339
you know spills a total need but at a

454
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:46,549
certain point if you really say say

455
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:47,779
you're in the organic food you want to

456
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:50,509
be smoking sun-grown

457
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:51,740
pure organic cannabis flowers all right

458
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:54,829
because you don't know what's in those

459
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:57,680
vape pens and you don't know if it was

460
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:59,210
grown organically or was pesticides or

461
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,490
what-have-you and it's likely not whole

462
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,190
planet either it's an art yeah right and

463
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,420
your P rose to are always the you know I

464
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:10,309
don't call it the sweepings off the

465
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:11,870
floor but you never can tell and so so

466
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:14,480
you know the true connoisseur and

467
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:16,639
there'll always be such will want that

468
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,849
you know thirty dollar Cuban cigar

469
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,890
alright and that you know well if it's a

470
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:25,569
Swami joint it's almost two and a half

471
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:28,250
three grams it could be a fifty dollars

472
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:30,109
but it smokes in a different way as you

473
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,150
found out right you know we get a pin

474
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:34,459
room but something that's a full full

475
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,259
joint actually smokes in a different way

476
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,970
and gives you a different effect but the

477
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:39,470
spirituality think now the people who

478
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,819
are coming in you're talking about the

479
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,450
corporate people at commoditization

480
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:47,119
people and so on then not touch the

481
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,259
plant people mm-hmm right we do the

482
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,359
business but they don't smoke at home

483
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:52,730
you know and nor do they touch the plant

484
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:54,349
right even the two manicure accurate

485
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,599
will do whatever so there's all of us

486
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:58,669
who are growing and trimming and

487
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:03,349
manufacturing we touch the plant and

488
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:05,509
when you do that there's a there's a

489
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:07,250
radiation between you and them and the

490
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:11,660
flowers of the plant there's this sort

491
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:14,170
of thing and and the endocannabinoid

492
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:17,779
system is is part of our thing and then

493
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,370
chlorophyll chlorophyll has a certain

494
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:22,579
chemical structure with the whole thing

495
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:24,829
and if you take hemoglobin and you put

496
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:26,990
it next to the molecule of chlorophyll

497
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:30,589
you realize that they're exactly the

498
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:34,150
same except that chlorophyll has

499
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:37,819
nitrogen and hemoglobin has iron

500
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,170
molecule so the iron in the hemoglobin

501
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,119
everything else being the same as

502
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:44,450
chlorophyll takes the oxygen in your

503
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:47,409
blood to your cells the nitrogen in the

504
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:51,170
chlorophyll helps nitrogen produce

505
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:53,180
oxygen but other than that there's one

506
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,830
molecule different between chlorophyll

507
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,070
and nitrogen that's how close we are the

508
00:20:54,829 --> 00:21:01,189
plants as living beings right so to me

509
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:03,230
that then that becomes another dimension

510
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,420
of the mysticism right that we're so

511
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,400
connected to this plant that I see a

512
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:12,830
consciousness within the plant itself

513
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:14,450
and I try to listen to my plants people

514
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:16,699
say they talked to their plants and so

515
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,500
on I do that too but more often I really

516
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,019
try to listen to the plants and then

517
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,109
they now are on the wavelength that you

518
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:24,420
are on

519
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:26,548
they're giving you messages the people

520
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:29,548
who are coming in to commodify this

521
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:33,900
thing I think the industry will change

522
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:36,900
them I don't think they're gonna change

523
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,750
the industry that much because without

524
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,470
the flower you don't have anything

525
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,279
really

526
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,630
right now back to the the think we were

527
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,428
sort of implying that the hippies

528
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,040
brought the spiritual aspect but that is

529
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:52,410
not at all true the african-american

530
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,240
plenty the blues community and the jazz

531
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:57,630
community was totally into the spirit of

532
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:04,099
cannabis and also the Latin American

533
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:04,100
community but let's rewind a little bit

534
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:14,130
3000 5000 years ago in ancient India

535
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,870
there were these texts which were chant

536
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:20,370
that called the Rig Veda when the

537
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:22,589
atharvaveda and there is a poems singing

538
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:26,959
the praises of this stuff called someone

539
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:30,449
and right from the start of these

540
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,600
Rigveda verses they're all sacred chants

541
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:36,590
they're chanted hymns and on the very

542
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:40,168
first page they talk about someone and

543
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:42,298
for years modern scholars have trying to

544
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:44,400
figure out what was the Summa stuff man

545
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:47,279
they were drinking it they were again

546
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,769
totally high on it describes how you

547
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,629
know and then so the one guys who's done

548
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:53,609
a lot of research this is a guy named

549
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,260
Chris Bennett you might have seen his

550
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:57,119
book I interviewed him last week all

551
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:01,349
right well Chris Bennett is like a

552
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:04,139
goldmine of information about the

553
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:07,168
ancient use of cannabis as a sacrament

554
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,900
and he's traced it and very convincing

555
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:14,120
argument even though he's not a Sanskrit

556
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:17,700
scholar back to those books up there and

557
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:19,529
these talk about this plant they make a

558
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,390
libation and drink from it and people

559
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:23,460
drink it and they want to drink more and

560
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:26,669
they get frivolous and happy and that

561
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,700
the plant that it comes from is gold and

562
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:32,910
green and purple and yellow didn't you

563
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,319
see all those colors up yeah there are

564
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,970
people who try to argue that it was

565
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,038
dominated

566
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,200
am I sure that people argue that was

567
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,230
some sort of psilocybin mushroom but if

568
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,048
you really look at the words of the text

569
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:47,808
it's describing stalks and stems and so

570
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:50,869
on it's pretty clear that it's actually

571
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:53,658
countless then jump to the Bible again

572
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:56,209
Chris Bennett points out the sacred

573
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:58,820
anointing oil in the Holy in the Bible

574
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:01,370
the holy anointing oil was made from

575
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:03,859
several things but one of the main

576
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:07,519
ingredients was called kind of busing

577
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:09,859
and scholars have always translated that

578
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,569
it's calamus which is an herb which is

579
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:13,038
an herb without any special real

580
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:15,168
characteristics why would it be in the

581
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:18,879
whole you know anything well but if you

582
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:23,929
say cannabis um is a phonetic cognate

583
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:30,799
technical term to Kenneth this kind of

584
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:33,019
list of cannabis well perhaps our whole

585
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,450
word cannabis comes from the Hebrew

586
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:37,548
cannibalism so there's considerable

587
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,460
argument in fact and I'm very convinced

588
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:44,750
of course it would be the holy anointing

589
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:46,970
oil was was cannabis oil and so even

590
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:54,429
today in India if you hang out with the

591
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:57,558
Baba's like I've done they wake and bake

592
00:24:54,429 --> 00:25:00,048
they have a Chilam they put in Chaves or

593
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:04,158
hash in the mix with tobacco and they

594
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:06,319
start smoking right but tobacco was you

595
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,110
know developed in Brazil in the new

596
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:11,089
world so more than my 300 years ago

597
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:12,619
those Baba's were smoking not with the

598
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,658
back that they were smoking with most

599
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:18,709
likely with flour canvas or all kind of

600
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:20,360
other herbs that you can smoke and so it

601
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,058
was part of a sacred ritual and one of

602
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:25,158
the things they did is pass it right and

603
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:28,339
they would say mantras when they smoked

604
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,370
it so you can say like oh they're

605
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:34,308
[ __ ] dico dunya cotellic or har har

606
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:36,408
Mahadev or boiling after always

607
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:38,960
different chance that you do when you

608
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:42,020
smoke cannabis with Baba's in India and

609
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,909
then when you pass the Chilam you cover

610
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:45,679
your heart and you only use your right

611
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,929
hand and you pass it always to your

612
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,629
right and very often you lost

613
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:53,659
say a mantra and so we've adopted that

614
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:56,599
in our Kannamma stay ritual for our

615
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:59,149
sacred cannabis church that when you

616
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,888
pass the joint you cover your heart and

617
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:04,189
you pass the joint you say kind of

618
00:26:00,888 --> 00:26:06,618
mistake to pass that to recognize both

619
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:09,499
the divinity and the plant and and the

620
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:11,148
divinity in each other and that this is

621
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:15,499
an ancient tradition that goes way way

622
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:19,459
back and the idea that soma is the

623
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:21,769
magical elixir of the Rig Veda and the

624
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:25,579
basic thing and it's still used today I

625
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:27,230
like the idea that regardless of the

626
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:30,138
culture whether it was hippie culture

627
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,509
jazz culture or Brazil wherever the

628
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:35,959
culture was this idea that there is an

629
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:38,929
inherent spirituality to the plant and

630
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,999
even if it is your friends cheerleaders

631
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:44,179
daughter or your friend's daughter who's

632
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:46,460
a cheerleader when the when you find the

633
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:48,590
plan and and it's the plant for you it

634
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,899
kind of calls you and you you are opened

635
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:54,048
up to it right now and you know some of

636
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:55,668
those people will will treat cannabis

637
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:56,808
like McDonald's because there's some

638
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,460
people who treat food with like

639
00:26:56,808 --> 00:27:02,028
McDonald's right but there are other

640
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:05,480
people who will get pulled into her and

641
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:07,609
and and and see the more spiritual

642
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,429
mystical parts like cannabis my - yeah

643
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:13,998
so again about the spiritual mystical

644
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:17,600
parts out in the garden I showed you the

645
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:20,839
statue of ganja mom right and so this

646
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,490
was a vision that came to me of the

647
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,349
goddess of cannabis conscious in the

648
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:28,298
sense the word for cannabis ganja mom

649
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:31,819
sees the mother goddess of cannabis and

650
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:34,970
so we have her in the garden and I put

651
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:37,730
the seeds in her lap ever feet for a

652
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:41,089
moon cycle before we plant them and then

653
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,579
we we tend the mantra which goes with

654
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:47,329
the goddess dream gleam stream gun to my

655
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:49,819
anima a ganja mantra and at the same

656
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:52,778
time we put a drop of Ganges water from

657
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:56,298
the sacred Ganges River on each seed and

658
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:58,878
this is as I said before inoculating the

659
00:27:56,298 --> 00:28:00,279
plant with the seed with a spiritual

660
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:03,549
intention with with

661
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:07,379
an idea that this is a spiritual healing

662
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:11,079
a medical healing and inspirational

663
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,970
source and so this is putting in these

664
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:15,579
other dimensions of the cannabis plant

665
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:18,400
and acknowledging them right in the very

666
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:19,929
beginning and so our goddess sits out in

667
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,200
the garden and we have another who sits

668
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:25,269
back here and so like when I took my

669
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,700
very first plant the other day I took a

670
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:30,549
flower off of that and put it up as an

671
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:33,340
offering to her and so that but when you

672
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:35,970
grow anything if you're growing it in

673
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:37,959
your backyard on a really small scale I

674
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,600
don't care who you are you're gonna get

675
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,309
into the magic of growth yeah just

676
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:44,859
something you put a seed in the ground

677
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:47,049
and up it comes and it's giving you

678
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:49,269
tomatoes or it's giving you a zucchini

679
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:51,250
or cucumber or whatever it is and as a

680
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,450
home gardeners it's just like this is

681
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,240
the best yeah right

682
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,120
and you feel the essence of growing

683
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:03,490
right of life being generated out of a

684
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:06,219
tiny little seed and and so that after a

685
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:09,549
while if you're an old hippie Bible like

686
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,299
me you can put consciousness into the

687
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:13,599
plant

688
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:16,089
you'll project it into the plant and it

689
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,429
then answers you back then you create

690
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:20,470
this this dialogue where you're

691
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:24,519
listening to the plant as much as you're

692
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:29,620
doing anything else and so what I see is

693
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:33,039
that consciousness as as an entity

694
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:36,879
almost is a continuum scale and

695
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:41,349
everything that is manifested in the

696
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:46,440
physical matter is on that scale of

697
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:50,559
consciousness so that a chunk of cement

698
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:53,110
has within it a molecular consciousness

699
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,569
and I think even in physics they talk

700
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:57,279
about you know nucleus electrons on but

701
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:59,559
then they talk about a strong force and

702
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,960
a weak force which is like this thing

703
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,539
that that it's like birds of a feather

704
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,410
flock together the molecules of concrete

705
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:10,480
hold together because they all know

706
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,700
they're concrete in a way now I know

707
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,759
this is hippie dippie wooo-hoooo New Age

708
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,759
stuff but

709
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:20,000
it's true every molecule is a vibrant

710
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:21,680
thing right molecules they have

711
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,789
electrons spinning around them they're

712
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,560
not just static the atoms are not dead

713
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:29,539
even if it's an actual mineral or a

714
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,480
piece of rock or anything else right and

715
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:34,759
there's a radiational field around each

716
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,190
atom which connects it to the other

717
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:41,930
items that recognizes effect well that's

718
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:44,029
a STONER right that's how we recognize

719
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,980
each other also that's a stunner over

720
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:50,389
there and so there's this recognition

721
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:53,750
that we are connected through some extra

722
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:56,840
physical force in a way and cannabis has

723
00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:01,039
that ability for us to actually sense

724
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:02,929
and recognize that force as I said it

725
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,319
heightens your awareness of your five

726
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:09,049
senses and your sixth sense and that's

727
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:12,109
the basis for its its spirituality right

728
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:14,000
there well thank you for your time it's

729
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:15,379
harvest I'll let you get back yeah think

730
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,089
having us in your home thank you all

731
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,680
thanks for coming up and good luck with

732
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:20,240
your show and everything it's important

733
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,190
to get the information out there and

734
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,710
share it with the share with people

735
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,390
because and like I say I have a great

736
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,640
faith in all the young people I'm

737
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:31,430
meeting who just also are you know

738
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,320
realizing that the sacredness of of the

739
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,460
cannabis and and actually the certain

740
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:37,939
point the people up here in the

741
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,680
mountains over time develop now I'm

742
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,019
painting a romantic picture I was just

743
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,840
like you did write about the way it was

744
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:48,529
in the old days but there was a sense of

745
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:50,720
mission a sacred mission that we didn't

746
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:52,609
even know how good this plant is we

747
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,029
didn't even know that it was a healing

748
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:57,889
healing plant and yet we knew somehow

749
00:31:56,029 --> 00:32:00,289
deep in that this was something that had

750
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:03,200
to happen we had to do it and that there

751
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:04,490
was a mission about you know creating

752
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,830
this medicine and making it available

753
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,170
people and now disseminating the

754
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:13,279
information about how the best way to

755
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:14,269
use it actually is and but that's a

756
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,730
whole other conversation

757
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:18,319
well I'll look forward to that okay

758
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,380
Thank You Man thank you all right thank

759
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:24,589
you do you need a sip of water or

760
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:28,240
anything first the only thing I'd really

761
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:28,240
like it's a job but we're fine all right

762
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,769
you
