1
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:12,809
we welcome Doug Jacobs Doug is technical

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,240
adviser for canvas customers and grow

3
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,949
dam he has been growing canvas since he

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,059
was 13 and has been consulting

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,009
professionally for commercial

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,919
horticulture since he's been in college

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,630
he has depth in both cannabis as well as

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,730
ornamental and other commercial growing

9
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:28,349
operations today who will be speaking

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,719
about technology assisted crop

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:51,989
optimization and irrigation please put

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:54,539
together what are the important things

13
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:56,878
you need to measure as growers what is

14
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,010
plant steering and how to create an

15
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,140
irrigation strategy so first things

16
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,908
first what is precision growing simply

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,489
put precision growing is growing more

18
00:01:02,908 --> 00:01:07,890
with less less water or less nutrients

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:12,600
less labor with the grow of increasing

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:15,239
yield potency labor while reducing the

21
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:18,179
use of labor water and nutrients and

22
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,949
increasing your profitability but also

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,049
becoming more sustainable as growers

24
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,329
reducing the amount of runoff we put

25
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,860
into the environment and reducing the

26
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:29,879
amount of natural resources we consume

27
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:31,950
precision growing is an integrated

28
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:33,899
approach that takes into account the

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,240
genetic that you're growing the climate

30
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:39,349
that you have in root zone management

31
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,968
and root zone management is basically

32
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:44,759
influencing the root zone of the crop in

33
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:49,828
order to steer it in a certain direction

34
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:52,769
to optimize growth so has growers what

35
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:54,629
can we control we controller to camp the

36
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:59,599
environment the temperature leaf

37
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:02,640
temperature humidity co2 light intensity

38
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,798
in the root zone we can select substrate

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,618
and that substrate determines the

40
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,310
availability in nutrients the air to

41
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:15,030
water ratio the electrical connectivity

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,939
so what nutrients we apply how quality

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:22,739
of them and how there are available to

44
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:24,180
the plant so first things first what do

45
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:28,890
we need to measure as growers in order

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,659
to optimize growth so obviously climate

47
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:33,539
climate conditions are important but

48
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:36,209
it's not just the minimum or maximum of

49
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,310
the day it's the actual trends so seeing

50
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:41,009
how the climate reacts to lights coming

51
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,890
on the plants up taking and transpiring

52
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:45,209
and so it's important to select the

53
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:47,729
system that allows you to see these

54
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,890
trends over the course of the day so you

55
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:51,359
can avoid any spikes that happen when

56
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,029
they're transitioning from night to day

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,380
or date tonight within the root zone

58
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,650
it's important to know the amount of

59
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,509
runoff your substrate is is putting off

60
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:07,250
but also what was the water content the

61
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:10,259
EC and the temperature of your root zone

62
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,509
crop registration so crop registration

63
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:16,199
is probably the most underutilized tool

64
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:17,969
in cannabis measuring plant height is a

65
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,009
really important measure is my plant

66
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:21,840
developing on time am i creating the

67
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:23,518
right structure is there something

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,099
preventing it from growing the same way

69
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,500
it was growing the last time looking at

70
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,500
leaf color you know allows you to see is

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,259
my plant imbalance is it getting enough

72
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,870
nutrition is there disease affecting it

73
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,969
a stem color again it tells you is the

74
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:43,530
plant in stress is it supposed to be

75
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:45,599
purple or you know is it under stress is

76
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,120
there bug attacking it is there disease

77
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,030
stem diameter stem diameter can be used

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,829
to track the rate of growth of the plant

79
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,739
and again if you can compare it to

80
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,129
previous crops you can catch a problem

81
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,359
before it really affects the whole crop

82
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:04,049
flower development you know measuring

83
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:06,540
diameter flower initiation when it first

84
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,580
puts flowers out how those flowers

85
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,650
develop over the site

86
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,450
I can really tell you well am i doing

87
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,800
something wrong has there been a problem

88
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:17,988
so it really really is helpful so so

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,430
plants during 101 so so once you're able

90
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,169
to control your climate and irrigation

91
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,790
you have baseline measurements to

92
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,830
compare from previous crops you can

93
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:29,240
start using irrigation and climate as a

94
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:32,419
tool to steer plant growth in a desired

95
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,639
direction that you want so vegetative

96
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,980
growth and vegetative growth is focusing

97
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,189
on growing leaves and stems the plans

98
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,020
tend to be more vigorous vegetative

99
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:44,029
steering can be used at any stage of

100
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:46,669
growth not just in the early stages but

101
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:48,229
within the flower farms to age in order

102
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:52,520
to prevent the crop from finishing to

103
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,890
fast and then generous exterior so

104
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,209
generally steering is focusing on

105
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,740
flowering

106
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:59,389
sends the signal to the plant that it

107
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,780
needs to reproduce foots all of its

108
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:06,139
energy into the flowers can be used to

109
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:08,329
make small compact plants it can be used

110
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,550
to slow down the growth of mothers if

111
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:13,219
you don't want them to stretch and grow

112
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,710
too quickly steering can be used to

113
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:24,230
increase the yield potency back appeal

114
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:25,909
by decreasing inner normal spacing so so

115
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,830
so obviously switching the lights to

116
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,419
twelve twelve initiates flower but you

117
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,019
can also steer the crop through through

118
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:33,500
climate

119
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:35,089
so having overall higher temperatures is

120
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,699
more vegetative while having overall

121
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:40,039
lower temperatures is more generative

122
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,569
sort of mimicking the natural natural

123
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,960
seasonal changes the plant would

124
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:47,360
experience in its environment difference

125
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,978
differences between day and night time

126
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,689
temperature having smaller decreases

127
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:56,539
between night and day temperature tends

128
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,969
to be more vegetative while having very

129
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,620
large and increasing differences between

130
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,500
night and day tends to be more

131
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,569
generative changes in temperature so

132
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,910
having very gradual changes in

133
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:09,620
I'm sure between night and day tends to

134
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,140
be more vegetative while having great

135
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,530
fast and quick changes is more general

136
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,779
it's a lot of stress on the plant

137
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:20,329
humidity so having slides wrong but

138
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,919
having a higher humidity in bed and to

139
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:25,279
make the plant more active while having

140
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,860
a lower humidity in flower makes it more

141
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,479
generative air exchanges of pipe

142
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,220
temperature this is more for for

143
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,439
greenhouses but you tend to have less

144
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,090
air exchanges in fetch they're trying to

145
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,699
have higher temperatures you're trying

146
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:38,839
to increase co2 where is an in

147
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,819
generative you're probably trying to

148
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,909
drop humidity so you might have more air

149
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,620
exchanges pipe temperature that's more

150
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,590
for greenhouse that you'd have a higher

151
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,720
temperature more heat to keep the family

152
00:06:48,589 --> 00:07:00,609
or vegetative and then reducing that to

153
00:06:50,720 --> 00:07:03,640
be more generative so it's life Erika

154
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,900
plants doing with irrigation so having

155
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,469
increasing or overall higher water

156
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:12,049
content tends to be more more vegetative

157
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,510
so this is manipulating the water

158
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,670
content within the root zone decreasing

159
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:18,969
water content and lower corner lower

160
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,170
water content overall is more generative

161
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,020
you're sort of tying the plant we're

162
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:26,710
taking away resources put your energy

163
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,709
into growing flowers

164
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:36,049
dodj it's dry here so water content

165
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,540
decreases overnight and manipulating

166
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,259
when do you start and stop irrigation so

167
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,310
having smaller decreases overnight or

168
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,319
irrigating earlier in the day and

169
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,970
irrigating up to the end of the day is

170
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:50,029
more vegetative they're applying more

171
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:52,190
water to their plant vigor dryvax

172
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:55,099
overnight or starting an irrigation

173
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:56,689
later and endings earlier is more

174
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,189
generative you're taking away of

175
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:01,370
resources from the plant you're drying

176
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:03,279
back harder you're stressing it out so

177
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,720
you're making it more generative

178
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,039
irrigation frequency so high frequency

179
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,660
of irrigation think of an aeroponic

180
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,700
system the more time I can apply

181
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,130
irrigations the faster I can get that

182
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,209
plant to grow where conversely once I

183
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:17,060
start taking away

184
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:19,430
and make it less frequent I'm sending

185
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,228
the signal complaint hey you have less

186
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,350
resources put your energy into

187
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:27,079
reproducing it's more generative ECS of

188
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,680
substrate e CS and dripper pcs tend to

189
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,240
be lower in veg and hired flour you're

190
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,229
providing the food that the plant needs

191
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,028
to grow and produce flowers and resin

192
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,680
substrate temperatures having higher

193
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:41,330
substrate temperatures again are making

194
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,579
the plant more active of taking more

195
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,290
water and in generative stage you're

196
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,420
probably trying to to slow that plant

197
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:50,569
down decreasing the substrate

198
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:52,189
temperature so once you know this we can

199
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,690
start creating an irrigation strategy

200
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,020
designed around what you're trying to

201
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,399
accomplish at what stage of growth but

202
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,990
the first thing you have to do before

203
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,559
you know creating an irrigation strategy

204
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,000
you have to collect select the substrate

205
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,819
and understand how that substrate

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,879
performs the density of the substrate

207
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,310
will affect the water holding capacity

208
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:17,600
drive ax feed how easy is refreshed and

209
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:19,369
held in the substrate fiber orientation

210
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,560
of particle size will influence the

211
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,839
irrigation capacity of the growing media

212
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,838
vertical fibers tend to be more free

213
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,820
draining more vegetative horizontal

214
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,959
fibers tend to hold more water and are

215
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,150
more generative the amount of substrate

216
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,338
you have also plays a role in how you

217
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,929
irrigate so having a small small tiny

218
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,850
volume of substrate requires you to

219
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:43,219
irrigate more often while having a

220
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,440
larger volume of substrate or it allows

221
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,850
you to irrigate less frequently and so

222
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,070
you'll typically see in commercial

223
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,839
greenhouses where growers are using a

224
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,330
small volume of substrate to fetch the

225
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,339
plant out to get it very vegetative to

226
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,990
grow very fast then they stick it on

227
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,910
another substrate volume that's much

228
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:03,970
larger so allows you to take away

229
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:06,500
irrigations and be more generative so

230
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,180
the initial wet up sets the stage with a

231
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,889
whole grow cycle and it will carry all

232
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:12,649
the way through the entire life of the

233
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:15,470
plant at scale of wetting limes and

234
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,480
watering blooms can save a lot of labour

235
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,889
and reduce water consumption and they're

236
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,339
actually much more affordable

237
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:25,369
you think but even just watering lawn

238
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:28,609
with a coarse spray is just a just as

239
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:31,449
effective and this be more likely to be

240
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:34,850
used but all methods require that you

241
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:37,729
make three slow passes to fully wet up

242
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,798
that substrate and done with some larger

243
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,649
substrate volumes you have to do more

244
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:45,409
than three times it key to just a

245
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,178
nutrient solution is required from the

246
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:48,618
spark from the start especially with

247
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:51,318
rock wall because rock wall has no

248
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:53,509
nutrient in em so we recommend that you

249
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:56,688
condition your rock wall in a 1 to 5 EC

250
00:10:53,509 --> 00:11:00,019
just for clanks and going up from there

251
00:10:56,688 --> 00:11:02,118
using a no using no nutrient or a low

252
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:04,938
strength solution at at the start wall

253
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:06,709
great week and stop plants and you know

254
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:12,259
carry all the way through the growth

255
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:13,608
cycle so after you do the initial wet up

256
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:16,220
it's important to check the weights of

257
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:18,980
your substrate to ensure that they're

258
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,048
fully saturated tray weights should be

259
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,869
recorded after initial saturation and

260
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:25,698
after cuttings are placed regular

261
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:28,220
measurements should be taken of those

262
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:31,159
trays to determine when to apply the

263
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,019
first irrigations same goes for block

264
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,698
weights after you went up that block you

265
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,259
need to test a couple of those blocks to

266
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:38,118
ensure that they're all been wet up

267
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:41,119
correctly and they're all the same you

268
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:42,528
probably want to check to see between

269
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:44,269
batches if they're all wetting up the

270
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:46,369
same because if you have one batch that

271
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,959
all it's less water or more water it's

272
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:53,360
gonna change the way you irrigate the

273
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:55,578
first time depending on environment and

274
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,470
genetic you should wait until the tray

275
00:11:55,578 --> 00:12:00,528
or the block reaches about 30 to 50

276
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:07,160
percent less the initial wait before

277
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:08,928
applying the first irrigation so hand

278
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,838
watering and dipping in trays is not a

279
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:13,488
precise way to apply variation cannabis

280
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,889
industry could really benefit from

281
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:18,859
adopting commercial systems for growing

282
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:22,249
plants Evan flow systems are the most

283
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:24,009
commonly used at scale but nmt systems

284
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:26,920
can also be used to really

285
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:30,309
control the application of water after

286
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:35,259
you know initial cuttings are placed or

287
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:37,269
that these reduced labor and also allow

288
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:39,100
the crop to be more consistent in

289
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,230
uniform because if you're hand watering

290
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,930
you know one block may get more water

291
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,430
than the other and then one block will

292
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,019
dry out faster than the other and you'll

293
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,269
notice in your canopy you know there's

294
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:53,439
that one plant that just fell behind the

295
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:55,299
rest of them so before talking about

296
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,640
irrigation strategy for veg and flower

297
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:59,589
we're going to suss rooting in so

298
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:04,470
picture here is an example the first two

299
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,470
dry backs for young tomatoes and blocks

300
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,240
over a five day period the blocks drive

301
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:13,299
back slowly from a very high water

302
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,509
content down to about twenty percent

303
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:18,609
this is not typical the big big

304
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,980
drawbacks like printer like this proof

305
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,480
of good rooting in but but also could be

306
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,430
very generative they slow the plant

307
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,259
growth down notice that you don't apply

308
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:28,449
water to that plant over the course of a

309
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:31,029
week it's just gonna sit there and not

310
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,280
grow so it's recommended depending on

311
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,809
the substrate and the genetic to apply

312
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,000
more frequent irrigations in the

313
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:39,759
beginning before allowing the substrate

314
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,159
to dry back and if you don't have a

315
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,590
water content sensor you can't be

316
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,819
measure it with a sensor itself you can

317
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,500
measure the weight of the block to

318
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,500
determine the first time you irrigate

319
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:59,669
this graph here is the ideal irrigation

320
00:13:57,448 --> 00:14:01,889
tract don't focus on the the frequency

321
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:04,379
it doesn't matter it changes depending

322
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:06,990
on your substrate so ideal irrigation is

323
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:09,198
broken up into three phases the first

324
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,310
phase builds up wider water content

325
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,500
dilutes the nutrient solution in the

326
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,899
substrate and it's providing new

327
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,639
solutions for the plant to uptake the

328
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,309
goal is to gradually build up water

329
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,019
content to achieve drain on time without

330
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:25,409
channeling without pushing out the water

331
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:28,019
straight through and into draining and

332
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:30,809
p-two the timing a first drain is

333
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,789
important because it keeps the EC in the

334
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:35,159
substrate under control well the plant

335
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,448
is working its hardest achieving drain

336
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,639
too early will will not only create

337
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:40,828
channels but would not allow for proper

338
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,680
reefs a chwarae ssin of the substrate it

339
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:44,818
will not be wet correctly getting

340
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,769
drained too late

341
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:49,439
spikes the EC when the plants working

342
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:51,899
its hardest causing unnecessary trip

343
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,959
stress that affects the plant growth in

344
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,828
p3 we stopped irrigation several hours

345
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,379
before sunset

346
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:01,828
lights off starting to dry back before

347
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,899
the end of day adjusting this drive act

348
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:05,519
can play a significant role not only in

349
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:09,360
root development but how you're steering

350
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,399
the crop so general principles to

351
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,620
consider on creating an irrigation

352
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,149
strategy first the golden rule the

353
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,740
golden rule is transpiration before the

354
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,100
year before irrigation you want the

355
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,149
plant to actively start up taking water

356
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,100
before you apply that irrigation

357
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:24,958
typically if you have a sensor you're

358
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,939
looking for a one and a half to two

359
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:32,429
percent dry back before that your first

360
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:34,078
irrigation in pute and p1 typically

361
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:36,120
larger volumes are used in the morning

362
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,870
to build up water content and achieved

363
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,360
rain on time ideally a 1% dry back or at

364
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,370
least a 30 minute rest time is needed

365
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,149
between irrigations in order to prevent

366
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:51,720
channeling in p2 smaller volumes are

367
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:54,389
used to to maintain the the ideal water

368
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,980
content in DC typically you want to

369
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,659
achieve

370
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,509
one to two percent drive act between

371
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:02,419
each irrigation but for some varieties

372
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:05,299
that don't like wet feet you can do a

373
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:08,389
three to four percent dry back between

374
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:10,759
each irrigation event and it hasn't been

375
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:12,259
studied well but some growers do like to

376
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,179
achieve much bigger drive acts within

377
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,860
the day in order to be more generative

378
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:17,929
but it's not recommended to do this

379
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,399
early on because they will make it much

380
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:24,588
harder for you to read what your your

381
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:26,778
growing media and mp3 stop time has a

382
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,760
significant effect on route development

383
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:31,309
and crop steering and should be adjusted

384
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,159
carefully throughout the cycle the goal

385
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:36,198
is steering the crop or steadily

386
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,969
increasing drive acts towards the end of

387
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:42,708
cycle to be incredibly genitive at the

388
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:45,139
end typically you're achieving 10 to 15

389
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:48,078
percent drive acts overnight and veg and

390
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:49,970
ugly flower but in late flower you can

391
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,849
achieve 20 to 30 percent drive acts

392
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:55,730
overnight to to increase that jeté of

393
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:58,759
steering and the most important thing is

394
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,500
volume of water applied is directly

395
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:04,660
related to the amount of substrate

396
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:07,880
you're feeding so here's an example of

397
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,980
substrate volumes and their irrigation

398
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,000
shot sizes so the volume of substrate

399
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,370
determines how much water you're

400
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,548
applying this is true for all types of

401
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:18,558
growing media 3% shot sizes are more

402
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:20,779
vegetative so basically you're taking

403
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,639
the volume of substrate you have so you

404
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:26,359
have a liter of substrate I'm gonna

405
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,429
apply a 30 mil shot every time if I want

406
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:31,428
to be more generative I'll apply a 6%

407
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:33,590
shot or something larger than that you

408
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,269
can adjust these shot sizes but

409
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:37,730
generally you should stay between three

410
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:40,279
to six percent shot size range in order

411
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:44,808
to prevent channeling or under feeding

412
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:46,629
of the substrate start times start and

413
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:48,558
stop times in relation to dry back

414
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,540
adjusting the start and stop times

415
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,808
controls the dry back overnight plays a

416
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:56,000
significant role in how its developed

417
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:57,859
the numbers here at reference so it's

418
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,869
important to know that you don't want to

419
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:01,129
just jump from one of these to the other

420
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:03,349
and you want to make very small

421
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,400
adjustments over several days in order

422
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,659
to work

423
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,360
into the steering that you're trying to

424
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:15,540
do and at the end of cycle you you want

425
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:19,558
to achieve these bigger drawbacks

426
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:22,230
towards the end so in addition to in

427
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,750
addition to irrigation strategy playing

428
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,808
a role in crop steering it controls the

429
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,329
EC in the root zone so you can actually

430
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:32,339
play with water content EC by jesting

431
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:35,009
the amount of water applied and its

432
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:37,769
frequency so short water events prevent

433
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:40,609
drain rates water content and raise ez c

434
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:43,019
it's more vegetative long water events

435
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:45,959
creates more drain and lowers water

436
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,668
content and lowers EC a high frequency

437
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,429
of watering increases the amount of

438
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:53,309
water and lowers EC raises water content

439
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:55,019
is more vegetative less frequent

440
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:57,240
waterings decreases the amount of water

441
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,160
it raises the EC in the root zone and

442
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:04,679
lowers water content it's more

443
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:07,529
generative so measuring drain it isn't

444
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,390
critically important to measure how much

445
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:12,089
water is applied for how much drain is

446
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:14,190
achieved on a daily basis this is a

447
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:16,079
measure of how much water the plant is

448
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,120
using a check on plant health and

449
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,460
ensures irrigation systems are working

450
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,089
correctly it helps to ensure that you're

451
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,130
not only over watering or under watering

452
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:27,720
ideally this should be used as a

453
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:31,169
measurement every day to create your

454
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,700
next day's irrigation strategy it's also

455
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,730
important to know when you achieve the

456
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,000
first drain of the day this will help

457
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,640
you prevent channeling in the root zone

458
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,919
depending on substrate type you want to

459
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,890
want to achieve drain one to three hours

460
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,870
after that first irrigation achieving

461
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:53,900
drain to really causes channeling and

462
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:53,899
makes it much harder to rewetting media

463
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,860
drain percent adverse expected radiation

464
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:01,168
for vegetables so the amount of drain

465
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:03,808
needed depends on climate conditions and

466
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:05,460
how the plants are performing under low

467
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:07,039
light conditions and wild climate

468
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,298
conditions less drain is required

469
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,308
because the plants are not taking up as

470
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,839
much water under high light

471
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:15,028
density and really hot humid

472
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,918
environments require higher volumes of

473
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:19,648
drain in order to maintain stable water

474
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,559
content in EC in the root zone but it

475
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:24,989
also makes sure's to even out any

476
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,548
inconsistencies in the plant so it's

477
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,499
like if you have one plant that's higher

478
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:31,999
or lower and water content that cheating

479
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:34,379
drain should allow you to even those out

480
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:36,450
using the precision drain volumes listed

481
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:38,459
here it's not only good for plant growth

482
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,379
but for your bottom line reducing the

483
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,808
amount of nutrient of water that you're

484
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:46,408
sending it down the drain and it's

485
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:48,298
better for the environment drain EC is

486
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:53,129
not representative of what's in the

487
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:56,220
substrate do not use drain EC or pH as a

488
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:59,609
primary indicator for adjusting EC and

489
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,200
pH concentrations at the dripper hi are

490
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:02,998
you seeing the drain is normal as the

491
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,970
drain contains the old nutrients that

492
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:07,889
were held in the substrate pH of the of

493
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,139
the drain is influenced by the plant's

494
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:12,538
interaction with the nutrient solution

495
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:14,459
and can be used as a indicator of how

496
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,980
the plants performing but it shouldn't

497
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,720
be your deciding factor on how you feed

498
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,220
that plant really you need to correlate

499
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,990
what's going on in the drain and the

500
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:28,379
root zone and what how the plant is

501
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:31,019
actually performing substrate EC in

502
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:32,969
relation to that into radiation and for

503
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:34,618
vegetables substrate EC needs to be

504
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,889
adjusted based on light and climate as

505
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:39,329
well substrate EC can be significantly

506
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:41,668
higher than we think

507
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:43,259
so you can see vegetables under low

508
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:46,009
light conditions for tomatoes you can

509
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,288
have an EC as high as 8 in the root zone

510
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:53,069
it's not uncommon to see to the 3 ec s

511
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:55,259
and veg in getting up to 5 6 plus EC and

512
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:57,089
flower as we discussed discussed

513
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,399
previously substrate EC can be

514
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:02,398
controlled by manipulating the frequency

515
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:04,138
and volume of the irrigation in general

516
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:06,719
EC of the dripper should never be

517
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:10,648
changed more than 0.5 EC per day and you

518
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,639
should never apply just plain water in

519
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:15,898
the middle of a cycle so now that you

520
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:19,248
have all this information you can make

521
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:19,248
your own schedule

522
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:25,569
II see water content climate set points

523
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:28,240
throughout the growth cycle having these

524
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:30,939
clear set points can be used with proper

525
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,890
registration and historical data to

526
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,200
ensure that the promise is developing

527
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,160
consistently can help your staff catch

528
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,140
problems before they spread and the

529
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,790
historical data can allow you to have a

530
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,560
baseline so when you start conduct

531
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:47,409
conducting texts with different

532
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,179
substrates with different nutrients with

533
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,180
different growing techniques you can

534
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:55,750
compare how they they affect that crop

535
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:59,529
or that genetic so in summary precision

536
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,880
growing is a continuously develop is

537
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:03,160
important for continuously developing

538
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,260
high quality plants yield and cost

539
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,830
management plants can be steered by

540
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:10,329
climate irrigation and labor plants

541
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:13,149
responds to irrigation strategies are

542
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:14,799
the same regardless of substrate and the

543
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,390
more relevant information you have as a

544
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,190
grower the more data you have that you

545
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,070
can use to compare to the better off

546
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:36,809
you're gonna be

547
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:36,809
and that's my presentation yes sir

548
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,669
I mean it depends on on what growing

549
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,679
media you use I mean some substrates you

550
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:46,028
require you haven't have run off but

551
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:47,980
that's something that grow tin is

552
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:51,700
focusing on is zero discharged

553
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,079
agriculture so it's possible and you

554
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:58,319
just have to pick the right substrate

555
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:58,319
that allows you to do it okay

556
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:05,980
if what if you're using like super seems

557
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:07,449
like rock wool type of environment what

558
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:12,089
if you use another super soil and you're

559
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:16,990
using a compost teas and really organic

560
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:19,449
do you need to measure that EC content

561
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,399
coming out and do I need to water it to

562
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,220
the point where it's actually draining

563
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:27,158
every day if it's it's completely

564
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,470
organic you don't need to achieve drain

565
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,440
every day I mean the problem with using

566
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,480
organic nutrient solutions in a drip

567
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,778
irrigation system is that you can't use

568
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,370
pressure compensation because that's not

569
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:41,319
true it's very hard to use pressure

570
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:43,058
compensated systems because you have to

571
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:46,418
flush the lines almost every time

572
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:49,058
between each irrigation so assuming you

573
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:51,250
don't have that problem you can't use

574
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:52,778
organics it does work for soil the same

575
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,730
way as it worked for rock wall

576
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:56,919
the difference being you will have to

577
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,019
achieve probably more drain at certain

578
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:04,409
stages than you would with other

579
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:04,409
substrates more questions

580
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:19,180
don't she's not allowed to ask questions

581
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:21,759
does she know you're Silver's what a low

582
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,410
rate do you recommend irrigating Wroclaw

583
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,440
and why Oh

584
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:28,870
so for rockwool my typical typically

585
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,420
recommend a low flow rate so 1/2 gallon

586
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:33,459
per hour or less in order to prevent

587
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,980
channeling because Rockville is more

588
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,200
porous so if you throw a lot of water

589
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,059
really quickly you will create channels

590
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:48,250
in the growing media you won't be wet it

591
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:52,049
correctly questions you know you're just

592
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,049
a little bit of barest you can do it

593
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,210
there you go thank you

594
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:03,548
so you asked if I already suggested

595
00:26:01,388 --> 00:26:04,778
doing measurements on a daily basis you

596
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:06,638
know kind of in the morning in the

597
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:08,138
afternoon to assess your cycles is there

598
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:10,418
any value in increasing the frequency of

599
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:12,969
those measurements during the day yeah

600
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:15,879
so I mean it's um the one would be like

601
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,558
when do you cheat drain and how much it

602
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:19,808
drain maybe you've achieved at a certain

603
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:21,490
point of the day but it's hard enough to

604
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:23,230
get somebody to measure their drain and

605
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,450
the amount of water applied on a daily

606
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,278
basis I'd usually start there but I

607
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,379
think another point would be when do you

608
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,950
achieve that dream so that's the tipping

609
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:34,269
point you're looking for yeah thank you

610
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:37,778
we've got time for one more question if

611
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:39,829
you've got it all right that looks like

612
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:42,910
it thank you very much

613
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:42,909
