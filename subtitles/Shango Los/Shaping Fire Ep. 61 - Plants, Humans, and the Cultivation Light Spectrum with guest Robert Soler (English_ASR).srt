2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,009
one of the most difficult aspects of

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,559
cannabis cultivation is learning how to

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,298
use light at an expert level the Sun is

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:16,618
pretty much always the same and reliable

6
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:17,608
and that's one of the reasons I prefer

7
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:19,800
greenhouse growing

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,180
however most artificial light sources

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,219
traditionally used for cannabis

10
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,778
certainly got the job done even though

11
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,479
they were inefficient and gave off a ton

12
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,820
of heat but the application of light to

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,980
plants whether it be from sunshine or

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,600
electricity actually is just one part of

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,850
the skill set a cannabis cultivators

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,250
needs to understand in order to perfect

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,079
their craft if you want to learn about

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,579
cannabis health business and technique

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,989
efficiently and with good cheer I

39
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,959
former NASA lighting engineer Robert

40
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,759
Solaire robert Solar has worked at the

41
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,709
Kennedy Space Center where he helped

42
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,049
design and build the cultivation module

43
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,539
and the first LED light for the use on

44
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,770
the International Space Station

45
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,450
additionally he served as a subject

46
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,339
matter expert for NASA's circadian

47
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,409
lighting system he holds a master's

48
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,359
degree from the lighting Research Center

49
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,689
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and

50
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,859
has begun a PhD in behavioral

51
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:45,389
neuroscience where he received a

52
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,429
fellowship from the National Science

53
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,009
Foundation for investigation in

54
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,259
circadian lighting paradigms Robert is

55
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,060
presently vice president of biological

56
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,218
technologies and research at BIOS

57
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,810
lighting on today's show we're going to

58
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:59,669
talk about some of the key threshold

59
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,649
points in the relationship between the

60
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,930
light spectrum and cannabis plants that

61
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,790
impact all cultivators clear up some

62
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,649
botanical myths that persist in cannabis

63
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,020
cultivation and talk a bit about how

64
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,400
working under artificial lights impacts

65
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,069
the lives of professional indoor

66
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,438
cultivators welcome to the show Robert

67
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:18,598
yeah thanks for having me awesome man I

68
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:19,769
know that you you're a busy guy and I

69
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,949
appreciate that you take some of that

70
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:24,810
valuable time and share it with us and I

71
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,729
really appreciate that you've got you

72
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,188
know the NASA space station in your

73
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,449
background because it's an interest of

74
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:32,430
mine having worked on the space shuttle

75
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:33,988
program and the space station myself and

76
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,049
I just generally think it's really cool

77
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:40,049
still and so before we go into a lot of

78
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:41,040
the more light and botanical questions

79
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,319
I've got for you today

80
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:47,578
would you just tell us about the grow-op

81
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:51,568
in the space station yeah I worked on a

82
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:54,930
a project called Abers which is an

83
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:57,929
advanced biological research system that

84
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,419
grew Rabbid OPS's so I was on the team

85
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,870
that worked on that my role is the LED

86
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:07,010
lighting expert so you know it wasn't

87
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,870
probably as sexy or or anything that

88
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:13,979
that this audience cares too much about

89
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,688
but there's a rabid OPS's is pretty cool

90
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:19,738
because it's almost like the white mouse

91
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:22,228
of a you know laboratory experiment so a

92
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,878
lot of experiments a lot of fundamental

93
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,739
science is done with the rabbit offices

94
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,918
so it's kind of kind of groundbreaking

95
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,840
research for growing you know plants in

96
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,269
outer space and that's kind of evolved

97
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,650
into you know growing you know flowers

98
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:40,590
on space station growing vegetables and

99
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,359
herbs on space station so things that

100
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,299
are good for us both nutritionally and

101
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:46,560
and psychologically so you know when I

102
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,549
think about the space station I'm

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,269
thinking about everything being

104
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:54,689
incredibly compact how large is the

105
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,449
growing area and were you finding that

106
00:03:54,689 --> 00:04:00,509
you were having to devise smaller

107
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:03,870
versions of the technologies just to get

108
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:06,688
him on the station oh absolutely and and

109
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,629
that's exactly what NASA loved about LED

110
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:11,280
specifically was that it was small it

111
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:13,858
was you know you could put it in pretty

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,900
much any form factor you you wanted it

113
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:20,280
was rugged so when it goes up on a

114
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,348
rocket or Soyuz rocket it's it's going

115
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,109
to last it's not made of glass or

116
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:27,269
anything it's very rugged so but the the

117
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,040
team that we had was

118
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:32,189
it was basically the space flight

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,010
experiment team so astronaut I'm not

120
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,540
sorry astronaut you know scientists

121
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,879
would come from all over the world and

122
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,640
and basically to fly their science on

123
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,350
space station they would come to us and

124
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,139
we would basically develop the hardware

125
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:49,110
and shrink it down to what's called a

126
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,449
mid-deck Locker size box where that

127
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,530
experiment would run so basically you

128
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:58,019
have you know minimal space to to have

129
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:01,439
all your HVAC your cooling your nutrient

130
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:03,149
deployment your lights everything was

131
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,269
all kind of in a really really

132
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:08,159
compressed space and astronauts would be

133
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:11,519
able to open it up kind of check on

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,160
everything so when we're camera based it

135
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:18,359
was all very high-tech I'm trying to get

136
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,640
as much science we can autonomously yeah

137
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,530
so yeah and as compact as you could

138
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,329
imagine and of course lightweight cuz I

139
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:29,969
think things cost about $10,000 a pound

140
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:33,000
to send into space so weight is huge if

141
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:36,300
you sure sure you know I I think most of

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,079
us who picture plants growing in space

143
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,900
from either movies or or just you know

144
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:45,659
imagination we imagine there being you

145
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:48,000
know like a table somewhere and it's got

146
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,770
it's got green plants growing out of it

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,279
that are just kind of like in the air

148
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:55,229
and sharing air with the astronauts is

149
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,449
that how it is or is everything all like

150
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,980
super sealed behind plastic because

151
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,829
everybody all the environments are

152
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,540
separate oh yeah they want they you

153
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:05,879
don't want any cross-pollination you you

154
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,250
everything is an experiment so it's

155
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,469
really not designed for you know

156
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,810
life-support at this point so it's

157
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,700
really just it wants to have its closed

158
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,889
environment it's gasketed off so

159
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:20,009
whatever is going on in recirculating in

160
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:22,110
in this one environment doesn't doesn't

161
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:24,060
commingle with you know any of the other

162
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,879
you know hundreds of experiments that

163
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,139
are going on at the exact same time I'd

164
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,230
assume that you guys are probably

165
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:34,439
running some kind of you know Rock will

166
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,780
substrate and feeding liquid nutrition

167
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,310
rather than

168
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:39,919
any kind of living soil which would have

169
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:44,360
a ton of variables is that true oh yeah

170
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:47,600
so it's uh it is so the nutrition system

171
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,540
is all kind of predetermined some of the

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,639
stuff that was that's recently done is

173
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,310
in these little pods these soil pods

174
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,040
where all the nutrients is already

175
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,980
contained in inside that and then you

176
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,500
have to syringe in water because as you

177
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,060
know water in microgravity doesn't

178
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,668
doesn't go where you want it to go I

179
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,860
goes everywhere so you have to have a

180
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:11,689
very specific delivery system to make

181
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,870
sure that's getting into so everything

182
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:18,709
is very well contained in order for it

183
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:22,550
to work right on so um you also worked

184
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:25,879
on the the grow lab in Antarctica didn't

185
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:29,360
you yeah that's right so I said they

186
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:34,370
were looking in it was the McMurdo Sound

187
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,400
station grow facility they were looking

188
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,680
to to kind of see if they could go into

189
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:43,728
LED technology so we did this probably

190
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,769
about eight years ago growing the the

191
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:49,310
fresh fruits and vegetables that are on

192
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:51,349
there down there in Antarctica so pretty

193
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,418
cool pretty cool stuff yeah that's

194
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,490
really great and and I'm sure they're

195
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:56,779
thrilled to do anything to get fresh

196
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,280
fruits and vegetables there since

197
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:00,349
everything's shipped in like a couple

198
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,149
times a year probably get really really

199
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,939
tired or whatever their version of MREs

200
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,939
are that's right yeah yeah it was really

201
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:10,519
important from a from a psychological

202
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:12,560
mental stability standpoint to see

203
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,930
something growing to see kind of some

204
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,079
semblance of like what's what's normal

205
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,259
in most people's perception yeah I mean

206
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,509
go ahead you know I I just think that we

207
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,829
talked a lot about space and I think

208
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,589
there's one thing that's really

209
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:29,569
fascinating about space is you know we

210
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:31,129
look at the spectrum of light and kind

211
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:32,960
of going back to the what we're what

212
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:35,838
we're gonna be talking about but you

213
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,908
know plants are hyper efficient to to

214
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,360
red light and and we now know kinda it's

215
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:42,710
a balance of red and blue but one of the

216
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,959
first discoveries about kind of

217
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,320
phototropism is that you know if you

218
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,399
grow plants in space under only red

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,890
light

220
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,259
plants grow in every single direction

221
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:57,679
they don't have any up or down they just

222
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:00,049
kind of they just grow outward if you

223
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,289
will and so just adding a little bit of

224
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:04,879
blue light gives them some orientation

225
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:06,409
so that they'll actually grow up towards

226
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,080
the light because otherwise they have

227
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:11,209
really no understanding there's no

228
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,460
gravity there's no buoyancy to kind of

229
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:16,220
tell them what's up and down in fact

230
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,540
blue light tells them which way to go

231
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,759
and I think that that's a really

232
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:22,129
interesting story as we kind of think

233
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:25,789
about you know how we deliver blue light

234
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:27,980
I'm here on earth and in more normal

235
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:30,139
cultivations yeah and and maybe even

236
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,570
strategically how it could be used you

237
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:34,129
know maybe and I don't know this to be

238
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,770
true I'm just positing here but like you

239
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:38,389
know maybe red light will give you a

240
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:40,669
shorter bushier plant that's growing out

241
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:42,980
whether we're we're as feeding it more

242
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:44,779
blue light will make it more erect is I

243
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,190
don't know if that's true but but I bet

244
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:48,589
you there's lots of people researching

245
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,800
that right now that's right yeah I mean

246
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:53,930
it's it's actually kind of the opposite

247
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:57,289
blue light is kind of the the natural

248
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:59,229
signal for for more light availability

249
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:01,939
so when you're depleted a blue light

250
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,610
plants will actually grow out longer and

251
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,730
stemi err to try to in search for kind

252
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,700
of more light availability and so so

253
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,600
it's actually a blue depleted light will

254
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:19,430
will create a longer stem ear kind of

255
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:21,500
lanky looking plant so so that's

256
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:25,219
generally why a lot of the strategies

257
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,220
are around kind of a blue enriched early

258
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,230
in the early stages of plant growth

259
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,170
right on so let's go ahead and make our

260
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,600
transition to the the stuff that I asked

261
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:39,019
you to come and join us with because

262
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,779
well you know you are an LED specialist

263
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:44,299
for both you know your company BIOS and

264
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:47,149
formerly for NASA the things that that

265
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:49,159
I've heard you interview about which I'm

266
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,289
most interested is actually the

267
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,629
relationship between the vel light no

268
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:55,879
matter its source and the plant as a

269
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:58,779
living organism and you know this time

270
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,429
of year a lot of people have got

271
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,110
transition concerns from taking their

272
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:05,049
plants from

273
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,149
indoors and moving them outdoors and so

274
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:08,679
a lot of us are talking about light

275
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,649
cycles so let's go ahead and start there

276
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,469
that let's go ahead and start there so

277
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:17,289
indoors the lights are weaker than the

278
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,149
sunshine but the day is usually longer

279
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:23,139
before because most folks have their

280
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:25,240
lights on 18 6 or 24 0 to help get them

281
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:28,360
established and getting growing before

282
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,269
they go outside yet so often when the

283
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,730
plants go outside into the more intense

284
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,870
sunshine but you know this time of year

285
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,870
depending on where you are in the

286
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,089
country it's about 15 9 they start to

287
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,589
flower for a lot of people and we know

288
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:44,019
there's clearly a relationship between

289
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,930
the day length the light intensity and

290
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,100
flowering but you know for so many of us

291
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:51,129
we try to figure out where that

292
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,320
threshold is to cause flowering so we

293
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,629
can better manage our cultivation so

294
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,278
somewhere in there between like taking a

295
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:00,309
plant from 18:6

296
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,860
and bringing it out died outside 215 9

297
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:05,649
somewhere in there there is the

298
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,850
threshold where oh now your plants you

299
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,919
brought outside are going to go into

300
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,320
flower versus oh your your plants

301
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,448
transitioned outside without flowering

302
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,060
can you kind of like teach us a bit

303
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:17,889
about that so that we can make better

304
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:20,078
cultivation management decisions yeah

305
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,850
yeah I mean it comes down to exactly

306
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,099
what you're saying I mean the I think

307
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,940
the interaction with light intensity is

308
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,860
is an interesting one but I you know the

309
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,860
evidence points that photo period really

310
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,740
drives you know all of that kind of

311
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,120
seasonal cue of when to start flowering

312
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:42,789
so you know plants are basically gonna

313
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,320
strategize around taking all the energy

314
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:45,909
from the summer months they see a long

315
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,528
day they think of it as a summer month

316
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:50,559
well then when you shorten that period

317
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:53,259
that photo period it's thinking it's

318
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,509
going to interpretate interpret that

319
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:57,309
information as okay now the seasons have

320
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,319
changed and this is fall and this is the

321
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,879
time where I'm going to take all the

322
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,070
energy that I've created that I've

323
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,948
harvested from the summer months and

324
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,959
convert it into flowers so it really is

325
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:12,399
that transition from a long day to a

326
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:15,379
short day so as long as what you see so

327
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:19,059
if 15-9 is what you get outside

328
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:23,870
and that was compared to you know

329
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:26,149
eighteen six as you said before that

330
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,350
that might elicit a flowering event if

331
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:33,799
it was 59 inside and 59 outside it won't

332
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,899
so I think that when you you know if you

333
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:38,599
think about how you want to do this when

334
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,699
you convert from inside to outside think

335
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,210
about what that photo period is going to

336
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,550
be when you take it outside and do you

337
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:49,310
want to you know elicit flowering at

338
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:51,829
that time or not and if you don't you

339
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:54,589
want to basically set that time period

340
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,300
inside to be similar to a photo period

341
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,830
that you're going to see outside well

342
00:13:56,299 --> 00:14:00,199
the million-dollar question of course is

343
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,840
what is the similar right

344
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,780
so if eighteen six to fifteen nine is

345
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,990
very much going to be a precipitous drop

346
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:11,990
to cause flowering how close to fifteen

347
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,460
nine would you say we want to get to be

348
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,909
sure that we're not going to lose our

349
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:20,240
clones but by suddenly kicking them off

350
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:24,049
well so so what you I mean what you want

351
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,470
to do is you really want to make sure

352
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:28,849
that you you hit it all the way right so

353
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:32,120
usually what people do is a twelve

354
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:34,580
twelve so you know it's it's a it's a

355
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,350
relative difference but I think they if

356
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,480
you really want to do it if you would

357
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,490
really want to initiate flowering it's a

358
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,060
twelve twelve is what you kind of want

359
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,860
to shift over to but I do think you know

360
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:48,079
there's gonna be something really

361
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,610
interesting so there's you know hacks

362
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,820
that get you all over the place but I

363
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,500
think that what I've seen at least in

364
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
the literature is that you know

365
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,070
different strains come from different

366
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,690
regions and their seasonality czar

367
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:04,550
different so what's going to change

368
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:07,610
initiate the the flowering response for

369
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:09,649
one species might be different than

370
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,990
another species so I think that really

371
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:14,750
there are ways to you know if you want

372
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,480
to elicit flowering 12/12 going to do it

373
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:19,009
if you want to kind of play with the the

374
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,570
different thresholds I think that that's

375
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:24,110
that's something that's really

376
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,930
interesting to see how those impacts how

377
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,449
those photo period effects are going to

378
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:31,068
change you know the

379
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:33,528
product that you that you put out I

380
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:35,328
think the idea of where the cultivar is

381
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:37,730
from is a really interesting idea the

382
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:40,488
equatorial strains of cannabis may well

383
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,889
you know have different lighting

384
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:45,019
responses than the you know the

385
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:47,448
mountainous ones or the Danny Valley

386
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,769
ones alright let me ask you the question

387
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,448
in a slightly different way though

388
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:52,100
because normally for most of us who are

389
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:55,039
coming outside right now we're not

390
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,139
trying to cause them to flower as we

391
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,118
take them outside because really we're

392
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,948
gonna let the we're gonna let the

393
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:02,540
natural world yeah we're gonna let them

394
00:16:00,948 --> 00:16:04,668
do it and you know depending on where we

395
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:06,708
live in the country and the you know the

396
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:10,338
cultivar it'll all start kicking in

397
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:13,008
around you know mid ish of August right

398
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:16,189
so for most of us worked were taken you

399
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:19,339
know 12 18 inch plants outside now and

400
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:21,289
we want them to veg for another couple

401
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:25,999
months and and double or triple in size

402
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:29,480
or more before it flowers so so you know

403
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:32,239
I tell people you know if you can try to

404
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,579
have your flowers at 59 before you take

405
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:36,168
them outside and the problem is is like

406
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:38,388
who most nobody does that because a lot

407
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:40,428
of people they'll start there they'll

408
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:45,769
pop their seeds or start their clones at

409
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:47,928
24 0 or many people at 18 6 but then the

410
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:51,139
time from when they start their plants

411
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:55,038
at 18 6 and suddenly they're going

412
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:58,220
outside at 15 9 you know it's hard to

413
00:16:55,038 --> 00:17:00,409
step down that far I mean for myself I

414
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,678
try to step them down you know about a

415
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:06,828
half hour a week so that after after

416
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:08,990
I've had them inside for you know a

417
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:12,230
month or six weeks I've brought it down

418
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,419
two or three hours but every time I drop

419
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,459
it down a half hour I'm like concerned

420
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:19,610
that I'm gonna accidentally flower them

421
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:21,679
indoors so with with overlooking that

422
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:25,759
whole challenge where do you think it's

423
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,798
best for us to to to play with our

424
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,148
particular cultivars do you think that

425
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:32,179
they think that it's going to be more

426
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:35,778
effective for us to you know start the

427
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:38,360
plants on a shorter day or do a step

428
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:42,220
down or maybe instead of taking them out

429
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:44,529
at 59 maybe we take them out at at 17

430
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,179
seven and like your like at two hours

431
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:48,609
isn't gonna matter so so like where

432
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:50,230
we're in that variable process are the

433
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,229
ones that you think we're most likely to

434
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,319
find success you know jiggering with

435
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,909
yeah I I mean I really do think that as

436
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,859
I mentioned before some of these species

437
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:05,679
may be a little bit more sensitive than

438
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:07,509
others so so how you you know I there's

439
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,730
not one answer that's gonna cover all of

440
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:12,879
them but really what I would say is to

441
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,860
try to match so start with a shorter

442
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,900
photo period indoors is the way that I

443
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:19,119
would absolutely do it because if you

444
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,190
step it down as you said you know those

445
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,439
little steps might initiate a flowering

446
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,259
event and if that's not the outcome that

447
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,870
you want then you've just you know kind

448
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:32,079
of ruined your whole crop so so what I

449
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:34,629
would do is I would absolutely keep the

450
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,859
photo period as closely matched to that

451
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:40,809
the time that you expect to go outdoors

452
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:43,089
so you're suggesting maybe just kind of

453
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:46,869
like get off the myth that's normally

454
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:49,079
for you know traditional prohibition-era

455
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:52,359
indoor growers where they're like oh

456
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,678
24:18 six twelve twelve right because

457
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,569
because you know when you're when you're

458
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,620
running lights you can your god right

459
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:59,548
you can do anything you want

460
00:18:56,619 --> 00:19:03,069
whereas if if the plan is to go outside

461
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:05,349
maybe just pop pop your seeds or make

462
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:07,599
your clones at 16-hour days and even

463
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:11,619
though you're running your lights a

464
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:16,240
little less long you will make up for

465
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:18,069
that in having clear-headed knowledge

466
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,079
that when you go outside your plants are

467
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:22,210
gonna be safe that's right

468
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,668
that that would be my that would be my

469
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,259
recommendation and and the reality is

470
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:29,288
you know the energy expenditure is

471
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:32,140
pretty much the same I think that you

472
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:34,240
know you know I'll speak only on LED

473
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,820
lighting LED lighting could could hit

474
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,890
those light levels too because you still

475
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:42,460
want to hit the DL is the your daily

476
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:45,820
average light intensity the integral of

477
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:48,100
the light over the photo period so you

478
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:51,428
want to in order to go to that that

479
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:52,898
sixteen eight you're going to have to

480
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,309
use higher light levels in order to

481
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:59,589
still get the the growth that you want

482
00:19:56,308 --> 00:20:00,220
meaning intensity of light yeah all

483
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:02,918
right got it

484
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,528
I'm so so most of these you know with

485
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:08,649
with some of the old you know hyper

486
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:09,519
sodium metal halides you know you you

487
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:11,558
get what you get

488
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,048
there's no there's no ideas of dimmers

489
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,599
or any way to reduce lights or you know

490
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:18,569
do anything like that but with LEDs you

491
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:21,099
have infinite dim ability capabilities

492
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:25,028
some of these things are pushing out you

493
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:26,949
know 1750 micromoles per second so it's

494
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:29,019
you know these things are getting really

495
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,028
impressive in light output so you could

496
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,499
you can crank up the light levels your

497
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:35,169
energy expenditure is gonna be pretty

498
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:37,329
much the same because you know you're

499
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:40,840
using the same amount of energy over a

500
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:43,269
shorter period of time all right so this

501
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,918
plays in right into a question this is

502
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:47,528
probably the question I'm most excited

503
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,929
about asking you today and it's about

504
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:51,548
the 24 hour light cycle and it's it's

505
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:53,860
always interesting to watch folks who

506
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:56,558
are who are growing outdoors versus

507
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:59,918
indoors and how we were taught by our

508
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:01,538
mentors and then nowadays when when

509
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,249
indoors and outdoors and people are

510
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:06,069
going back and forth because it's it's

511
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:09,368
generally safer to grow in both in you

512
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:12,730
know both environments there's kind of a

513
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:15,490
clash of myth and and what people were

514
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,919
learned and one of the most watched

515
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,960
videos on the shaping fire YouTube

516
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,679
channel is an interview I did just a

517
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,558
quick one I did with dr. Karuna Chow ray

518
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:29,230
explaining that the 24 hour light cycle

519
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,628
is not beneficial for plants because

520
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,419
without a dark period microbes in the

521
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:36,878
soil will starve because it's during

522
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,830
this dark period that the plants feed

523
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,509
the microbes in the rhizosphere with

524
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:42,939
their exited so you know they push them

525
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:44,409
down through the roots this was the

526
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,690
first time I really considered the

527
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:49,509
give-and-take between the plants and the

528
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,879
microbes and for so many people they run

529
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:55,690
especially in hydro they'll just run

530
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:58,538
their plants 24 hours to have the plants

531
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,210
grow faster and for many people they

532
00:21:58,538 --> 00:22:04,089
actually can sneak another cycle in

533
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:07,329
their year because the plants grow about

534
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:09,579
20% faster with a 24 hour light cycle

535
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:11,679
and no break but

536
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:14,319
dr. calorie was very clear like you know

537
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,410
you are growing plants faster but you

538
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:20,139
are growing plants that are weaker

539
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,940
because you don't have strong microbes

540
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,509
and this back and forth before the

541
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,009
plants don't work as well but again Mike

542
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:29,529
my talk with her was only about eight

543
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:31,329
minutes so so does this sound like this

544
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:34,809
make sense to you that the plants need

545
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:36,909
this dark period and and if so what do

546
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:39,960
you see happening to benefit the plant

547
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:45,519
during the dark that is so essential

548
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:47,829
yeah so I'm a light nerd but I'm also a

549
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,049
circadian nerd which means that there

550
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:53,799
needs to be a 24-hour cycle and plants

551
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:55,539
respond to a 24-hour cycle which means

552
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,819
that it has to be both light and dark so

553
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:00,430
you know cell respiration occurs in

554
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:03,730
darkness a lot of beneficial things

555
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:06,190
occur during darkness so I think that

556
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,640
there's a lot of things that we probably

557
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,150
don't know you know I'm I'm not a plant

558
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:17,020
physiologist I'm a you know a lighting

559
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:20,650
scientist but so you know the the idea

560
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:23,109
of having a light and dark period is

561
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:28,180
going to drive the circadian rhythm of

562
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:30,909
that plan so so I think wholeheartedly

563
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:33,840
that we need to really a respect that

564
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:36,460
that dark period and if it's two hours

565
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:39,639
at a minimum I would like to at least

566
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:43,509
see the idea of 24 zero going to at

567
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,820
least 20 to two and again as I kind of

568
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:48,099
mentioned before there's infinite

569
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:50,740
expandability with with the newer LED

570
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:53,399
lighting technologies that that could

571
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,450
allow for the same kind of grow rates

572
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,330
because you could just have higher light

573
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:02,850
outputs and still have some sort of a

574
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:07,599
dark period now I think the idea of the

575
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:11,559
of you know microbial interactions is

576
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:13,809
really interesting but I think that

577
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,879
there is going to be a lot more going on

578
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:18,609
in that plant that's dictated by that

579
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,760
light dark cycle that is really you know

580
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:23,409
it always comes back to what what nature

581
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,629
is doing right

582
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:29,410
there's not too many environments that

583
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:32,200
are 24 zero and so so plants have

584
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,870
evolved around a an environment that's

585
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,549
both light and dark and so the better we

586
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:38,769
could do with that the better off your

587
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:43,419
plants going to be as a result I think

588
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:45,670
that my testament would be that that you

589
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,509
should strive to do that as much as you

590
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,940
possibly can

591
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:51,129
that's interesting that actually even

592
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,809
expands what I when I feel like I want

593
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,520
to continue to look into which is not

594
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:56,349
you're saying that yeah this is probably

595
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,299
all true with the microbes in the

596
00:24:56,349 --> 00:25:03,069
rhizosphere that makes sense but also

597
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:05,529
there are unique botanical I don't know

598
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:08,259
housekeeping that happens during the

599
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:10,569
dark period that the plant needs itself

600
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:12,940
it's not like a like a you know just a

601
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:16,210
photosynthesis machine and you just turn

602
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:18,910
it on and it runs infinitely it to needs

603
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,769
to take out the garbage and do cell you

604
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:24,519
know transpiration and and these other

605
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:28,599
things that it does during the dark

606
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:31,809
period yeah I mean there's there's some

607
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:34,000
species of plant that will you know

608
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:37,119
co-evolved with its predators and will

609
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,759
change its nutritional content over the

610
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:42,429
course of the day so that it you know

611
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:49,000
quote-unquote tastes yuckier to plants

612
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:51,610
are to disease yeah and then there are

613
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,950
plants that will Co evolve with their

614
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:56,109
their pollinators so that they'll you

615
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,269
know emit some odors to to kind of

616
00:25:56,109 --> 00:26:00,369
attract pollinators at a very specific

617
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:03,420
time and so there's all these things

618
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:05,709
that happen over the course of the day

619
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:08,140
biologically speaking and without a dark

620
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:10,269
period that plants gonna have no

621
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,759
reference for when the day starts and

622
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,319
when the day ends so I think that we're

623
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,019
probably gonna find out that there's

624
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,059
some interesting things that that are

625
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:22,779
happening as a result I think that

626
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:24,759
historically though the you know it's

627
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:27,730
always been one parameter so you get

628
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:29,410
longer hours you get more light and get

629
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,509
better growth but if you were to

630
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,870
compress that same amount of light from

631
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:36,879
24 hours into you know a shorter photo

632
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:37,229
period and just increase the intensity

633
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,299
of

634
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,190
lights I think you're gonna get a better

635
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:44,970
response right on that makes a lot of

636
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,769
sense so so let's move on to a different

637
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,279
line of thought but still talking about

638
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:53,099
light and dark period so so indoor

639
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,349
cultivators are very careful not to let

640
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:57,629
light hit their plants during the dark

641
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:59,548
period and for some that means simply

642
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,350
not entering the grow room for others it

643
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:03,660
means duct-taping any holes in their

644
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:05,519
indoor tents and for outdoor folks it

645
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,500
means not turning on the floodlights off

646
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,918
the back of the house at night right but

647
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,710
how do we know how much light leakage

648
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,080
will actually impact a crop where's the

649
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,660
threshold of where the interruption will

650
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:22,168
cause you know the plants biological

651
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:25,679
confusion yeah that's a that's a great

652
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:28,970
question I mean you know I don't I don't

653
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:32,820
know that there's a real threshold I

654
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:37,289
gather that it's actually not that not

655
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:38,970
that low it's not like you know the you

656
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,678
know a small incandescent light it's

657
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,130
gonna really do a whole lot you know the

658
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,780
the likely light leakage if it's minimal

659
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,000
coming through the cracks is gonna be

660
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:51,450
that much but I do think that you know

661
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,069
general practice to make the night

662
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,380
environment as dark as possible is a

663
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:58,168
good thing I don't think that there'll

664
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,600
be biological confusion but it may you

665
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:04,070
know halt cell respiration it may help

666
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:08,219
halt some of the nighttime activities

667
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:10,798
which are gonna be vital to to the

668
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,289
success of that crop so if we were to

669
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:17,429
think about which would be worse like

670
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:20,250
you know the the intensity of the

671
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:23,460
interruption of dark or the length of

672
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:25,380
the interruption of dark I want to know

673
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,740
if you have anything to say about that

674
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,260
so in comparison say walking into your

675
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,910
like let's say you know your

676
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:34,500
sister-in-law is in town and she walks

677
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,259
into your grow room and turns on the

678
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,329
light and during the dark period and

679
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:43,019
suddenly now there's you know there's

680
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:44,519
all these bulbs that are on and she's

681
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:46,408
like oh I'm this is not the room I'm

682
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,408
supposed to be on and so she turns off

683
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:51,270
the light so it was short maybe 10 12

684
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:55,530
seconds but it was

685
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:59,180
whole bunch of you know shop lights that

686
00:28:55,529 --> 00:29:02,849
may have come on versus say a tent

687
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,529
that's got a handful of like pinprick

688
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:07,740
holes in it right so you got this tiny

689
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:12,329
tiny amount but it's in your living room

690
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:15,569
so it's constant right so so are they

691
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:18,809
both potentially troublesome or really

692
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:20,399
does because perhaps some hormone or

693
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:22,619
something needs to build up in the plant

694
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,720
this short burst really isn't gonna do

695
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:28,859
anything and it's more what happens over

696
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:32,400
the longer term it you know it's both

697
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:35,219
so the said the plant will acclimate so

698
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,390
if the dark period is you know that

699
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:42,539
constant day you know that content like

700
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:44,700
threshold low threshold day-in day-out

701
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,920
it's gonna acclimate to that as being

702
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,180
kind of the standard for what nighttime

703
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,789
is as opposed to the bright light may

704
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:56,070
may alter it for that one night and you

705
00:29:53,789 --> 00:30:00,200
know maybe it will it'll actually shift

706
00:29:56,069 --> 00:30:02,460
the clock to to maybe like a

707
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,470
quote-unquote different time zone for

708
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,000
the next day but after about two or

709
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,990
three days it's gonna come right back to

710
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,539
it so that single event is probably in

711
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:15,480
in both cases neither one's really that

712
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:17,460
bad it's really just kind of if you you

713
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,019
know if you do something where you got a

714
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,930
lot of light for a long period of time

715
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:23,639
it's is it going to have a detrimental

716
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,950
impact I guess that's probably not a

717
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,130
very satisfactory answer so if I if I

718
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:31,830
have to pick one I think that the the

719
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:33,360
short bursts of lots of light for one

720
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:37,230
period of time is going to have a longer

721
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:40,439
lasting impact than kind of the little

722
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,059
like really dim light constantly right

723
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,279
on and actually getting to that you said

724
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:48,029
something I found very fascinating the

725
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:50,490
idea that if you've got a small dribble

726
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:53,160
of light coming into your growing area

727
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:55,950
whether it be indoor or outdoor that so

728
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,570
long as it's you know a low amount that

729
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,819
that could become if you will the new

730
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:01,319
normal it reminds me of what you know

731
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:03,299
shooting photography and you set the

732
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,878
white balance on a camera no it's like

733
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,249
hey

734
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:09,668
that this is what light is today camera

735
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:10,899
right and so if you do have a tent in

736
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:12,940
your living room and you're a patient

737
00:31:10,898 --> 00:31:14,828
and you're you know you're just doing

738
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,859
what you can to grow your medicine and

739
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:21,278
if you have an imperfect tent if you've

740
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:22,958
got a low level of light that goes in

741
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,818
there regularly your plants are just

742
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:26,679
gonna go okay this is what night's gonna

743
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:28,808
be for us so let's do our night stuff

744
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,629
when it gets to this point that's right

745
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:33,729
that's right now that's super

746
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:36,308
interesting Robert yeah I want to make

747
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:38,348
sure that that that doesn't mean like oh

748
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:39,608
you could just kind of crank on the the

749
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:41,769
ambient lights as long as you're doing

750
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:45,128
the standard practices to make that that

751
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:47,138
environment pretty dark that's that's

752
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:49,328
kind of what you what you want to do it

753
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:52,358
doesn't give you freedom to to just keep

754
00:31:49,328 --> 00:31:53,528
the lights on I'm around your plants you

755
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:55,298
definitely want to try to make it as

756
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:57,398
dark as you possibly can but but given

757
00:31:55,298 --> 00:31:59,908
that and it'll absolutely know what the

758
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:03,308
threshold is it'll acclimate to that

759
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:05,799
that low light level I've never heard

760
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:09,249
anybody say anything about the light

761
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:10,959
cycle and how it may impact plants

762
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:13,358
during a full moon right I mean I

763
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:16,028
understand a little bit about the the

764
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:20,048
biodynamic stuff from from those folks

765
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:22,989
about you know full moons but as far as

766
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:27,308
there being you know air quotes all of

767
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:30,098
this light during a bright night is that

768
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:32,499
I mean we experienced it you know as

769
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:34,239
human animals as a bright night and

770
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:37,209
because we can see and that makes us

771
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:41,229
feel safer but does a bright moon night

772
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:42,669
really impact the plants at all no no

773
00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:45,699
not at all that's that's way below

774
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:50,049
threshold you know that's like Oh point

775
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:52,298
zero zero one Lux on a full moon you

776
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:54,608
know there is really what we're talking

777
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:58,058
about I mean even you go outside and you

778
00:32:54,608 --> 00:33:00,578
see street lights there is evidence of

779
00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:01,568
you know trees that are right next to

780
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:05,408
that street light will have a

781
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:07,388
significant impact but the ones that are

782
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:09,549
you know kind of some distance away

783
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:11,378
those light levels just kind of think

784
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:13,868
about that light level that's not

785
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:16,298
impacting that's below the threshold of

786
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:17,470
what of what that plant is seeing and of

787
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:20,349
course back to the

788
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:22,808
original point when it sees that every

789
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:24,579
single day it acclimates and goes

790
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:28,418
alright yeah this is this is my

791
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:30,399
nighttime scheme right on I follow this

792
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:32,020
alright good so one more question before

793
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,690
we go to our first commercial break you

794
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:37,089
know some indoor growers use a green

795
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,100
headlamp to work during the dark periods

796
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:41,199
and other growers are like no that's

797
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:44,079
totally [ __ ] that like if you even

798
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,080
if you use green lamp it is interrupting

799
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:49,629
the the dark period so so you're the

800
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:53,369
scientists is is using a green headlight

801
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:57,789
lamp legitimate tech or is that a myth

802
00:33:53,369 --> 00:34:00,399
well so what a green headlamp will do is

803
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:01,869
if you're trying to assess the plant and

804
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,710
see how they're doing they're going to

805
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:08,168
reflect that green better so you could

806
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:11,648
get a sense of what's going on with a

807
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:13,868
lot less light so it has to be a really

808
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:15,339
really dim green light if it's a super

809
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:17,858
bright green light and you know you're

810
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:21,220
you're absolutely getting giving them

811
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:23,759
that bright burst of light at a time

812
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:26,348
that could actually throw off their

813
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,889
their circadian rhythms and their night

814
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:32,649
phase so I think that it is a good idea

815
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:36,010
as long as if you're not blasting those

816
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:39,460
headlights and the main reason is

817
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:42,220
because you're you're using the spectral

818
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,720
reflectance of that plant the fact that

819
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:46,598
it's reflecting a lot of that green

820
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:48,819
light it's using a lot of it but it's

821
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:51,429
reflecting the most of it back and

822
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:54,369
you'll if what you're trying to do is

823
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:57,070
see the plant you know assess an issue

824
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:59,289
and then go away you want to use as

825
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:03,099
little of it as you possibly can to make

826
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:06,190
sure you can do that to do it good

827
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:09,220
enough and then go about you know go

828
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,619
about your other business so it's not a

829
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:14,889
fail-safe it's not going to not

830
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:17,440
interrupt that plan it absolutely can do

831
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:19,329
that but the green light helps you see

832
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,070
that plant a little bit better using the

833
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:22,900
least amount of light you possibly can

834
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,609
all right that's interesting all right

835
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,920
so let me see if I can break that down

836
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:30,519
to two rules of thumb for everybody so

837
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:33,070
would it be correct if I were to say

838
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:35,800
if you're going to use any light green

839
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:40,300
is a good choice but you want to use a

840
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,340
small amount of it as you can and only

841
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:46,119
use it in a small area like with a

842
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:49,150
headlamp in contrast to I've even seen

843
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:51,460
people using green flood lamps in their

844
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:54,099
grow at night so that they can you know

845
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,500
clean and and things like that whereas

846
00:35:54,099 --> 00:36:00,309
that that's a terrible idea because the

847
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:03,010
intensity is more and longer Green is

848
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:05,019
not a magical color spectrum that

849
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,420
doesn't interrupt sleep that's right

850
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:09,159
that's absolutely right yep right on

851
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,360
cool well thank you very much for that

852
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:12,009
Robin we're gonna go ahead and take our

853
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,660
first short break and be right back you

854
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:16,030

855
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:19,269
guest today is lighting scientist Robert

00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:21,310
solare there are lots of good seed

857
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:24,340
makers out there every once in a while

858
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:26,170
someone becomes legendary the Mendocino

859
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,960
California cannabis breeder called

860
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:30,820
mandelbrot is one of these people

861
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,889
Mandelbrot was also known as Roz truth

862
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,750
and his cultivars are known as the

863
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:37,599
foundation for the Emerald triangles

864
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,940
world-famous gasoline scented terpene

865
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,980
profile back in the day when it was

866
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,590
really hard to find quality genetics and

867
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,630
education Mandelbrot was advocating for

868
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:48,490
organic growing techniques and providing

869
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,220
exceptional seeds that would sell out as

870
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:52,959
soon as they hit the shelves

871
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:55,929
Mandelbrot lived too short of life dying

872
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,820
in 2015 but while he was with us he

873
00:36:55,929 --> 00:37:01,029
created several connoisseur level

874
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:04,869
cannabis masterpieces like oil spill the

875
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:06,609

876
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,858
approach growing cannabis more as a

877
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:09,940
toker or a breeder you will find

878
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:12,579
something that delights you in

879
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,970
Mandelbrot selections because while some

880
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:17,559
strains are better to grow or to smoke

881
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:19,299
Mandelbrot's creations excel in every

882
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:22,239
category and that's why people keep

883

can't whereas most brands release

pre-rolls as an afterthought for the

Shango Llosa our guest this week is

1008
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,450
lighting scientist Robert Solaire so

1009
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:28,670
Robert you know during an interview with

1010
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:31,098
soil educator Jeff Lowen Fell's he

1011
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,710
suggested that sunlight has a very

1012
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:36,079
powerful effect on the soil microbes and

1013
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,900
soil life generally it isn't just the

1014
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,329
plants that's taking up the light it's

1015
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,950
actually the soil and you know

1016
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:45,559
everything that's living in it that is

1017
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:47,179
also taking in the light and and he

1018
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:49,099
continued to say that this is one of the

1019
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:51,048
reasons why indoor cultivation pales

1020
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,480
when compared to outdoor generally

1021
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:56,210
because the Sun is so much more intense

1022
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,998
that it has I don't know deeper reach

1023
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:01,670
into the soil I guess I'll say so you

1024
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:04,939
know what is it in sunshine that

1025
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:07,909
provides you know life to the soil and

1026
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:12,139
how difficult is that to attain nowadays

1027
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:16,788
with lights indoors yeah I you know I

1028
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:19,778
would think any of those benefits you

1029
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:22,670
know could come from the the penetration

1030
00:43:19,778 --> 00:43:25,099
but I would probably stand to the guest

1031
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:29,588
that it has a lot more to do with the

1032
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:33,220
spectrum so you know indoor lighting has

1033
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:35,989
the opportunity you know to do whatever

1034
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:37,719
but but for energy efficiency it's

1035
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:40,190
always putting all the energy at least

1036
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:42,588
the energy-efficient ones LEDs

1037
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,480
specifically will put all the energy in

1038
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:46,998
the PAR region from 400 to 700

1039
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,940
nanometers you know the Sun puts out

1040
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:52,848
stuff you know from 300 nanometers you

1041
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,700
know on up so there's stuff in the UV

1042
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:57,950
there's stuff too and the infrared

1043
00:43:54,699 --> 00:44:03,199
spaces and the interaction of those

1044
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:07,009
things with sunlight and daylight is is

1045
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:09,679
probably pretty and profound so I would

1046
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:14,690
probably stand to guess that that it has

1047
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:17,929
more to do with the the idea of you know

1048
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:20,869
it could be a circadian component of

1049
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:22,788
temperature but probably also you know

1050
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:24,979
the far Reds

1051
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:27,289
and the ultraviolets that come from that

1052
00:44:24,978 --> 00:44:30,978
that solar exposure that that's going to

1053
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:34,449
have the impact on microbes and I would

1054
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:37,308
probably say that that doesn't mean that

1055
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:38,809
interior lighting is inferior it just

1056
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:41,749
means that we got to get smarter about

1057
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:43,849
how we do interior lighting because we

1058
00:44:41,748 --> 00:44:46,098
could absolutely recreate any of those

1059
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:50,329
spectrums we could create far reds we

1060
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:53,778
can create UVA UVB so it really just

1061
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:55,910
comes around to playing around and

1062
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:58,789
really getting into the research of what

1063
00:44:55,909 --> 00:45:01,159
we could do to to kind of find out what

1064
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:03,259
those what those benefits are yeah

1065
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:04,969
that's interesting and and you know it's

1066
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:08,119
it's taking me a long time to come

1067
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:10,668
around this idea that it really depends

1068
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,989
on what you want for your output I mean

1069
00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:13,759
there's crappy outdoor and there's

1070
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:16,159
crappy indoor right and I've had good

1071
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:17,929
indoor and I've had good outdoor but in

1072
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,868
the end it's it's what you're actually

1073
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:24,668
looking to produce and if and if you can

1074
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:28,099
find a combination of you know a

1075
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:32,268
appropriately efficient indoor light

1076
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:35,509
that can sustain the proper you know

1077
00:45:32,268 --> 00:45:38,298
microbe life and also give the plant

1078
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:42,019
what it needs you may not need the

1079
00:45:38,298 --> 00:45:43,639
entirety of the sunshine spectrum but

1080
00:45:42,018 --> 00:45:46,188
there's no there's no doubt that when

1081
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:48,408
you're outside that you know there's

1082
00:45:46,188 --> 00:45:50,509
there's all the spectrum you need and

1083
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:53,088
more for your plans so there there's

1084
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:56,630
some kind of combination between you

1085
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:59,838
know the the knowledge of which parts of

1086
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:02,269
the spectrum helps sustain microbe wife

1087
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:03,828
and the rhizosphere and along the the

1088
00:46:02,268 --> 00:46:07,548
top layers that the light can penetrate

1089
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:09,709
and also you know I guess just bang for

1090
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:13,358
your buck right like if the goal is to

1091
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:16,188
produce a you know a good tasting

1092
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:18,918
good-looking plant that thrives and

1093
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:21,678
resists pests we mean we may be able to

1094
00:46:18,918 --> 00:46:24,618
do that without the entire spectrum of

1095
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,869
the Sun that's right and and I and you

1096
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:29,329
hit on a good point there is that you

1097
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:31,278
know as someone who you know makes

1098
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:33,949
lights you know you could make light

1099
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:36,000
with all these things but it's gonna

1100
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:39,030
cost you a lot more

1101
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,889
to have that that capability and you

1102
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:43,710
know you're gonna give up efficiency so

1103
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:45,569
so really if you wanted UV light for

1104
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,889
your soil you know get like a

1105
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:51,750
supplemental UV light UV LED light or a

1106
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:53,608
fluorescent tube and put it on the soil

1107
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,739
and test it out and see what what you

1108
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:57,358
get out of it I think that there are

1109
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:59,098
things you could do kind of add-on

1110
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,769
features that you could you could throw

1111
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:03,960
on to test stuff out and really kind of

1112
00:47:01,769 --> 00:47:06,269
see what what is gonna work for your

1113
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,119
individual grow I think that's probably

1114
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:12,449
the most important thing is to for us

1115
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,880
all kind of be scientists with what

1116
00:47:12,449 --> 00:47:17,219
we're doing well I appreciate you saying

1117
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,019
that I mean this show is very in favor

1118
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:20,759
of citizen scientists and it's funny

1119
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:23,400
because sometimes I'll have you know

1120
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,140
either guests on the show or scientists

1121
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,410
all meet at conventions or whatever and

1122
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:30,659
they really don't like the you know the

1123
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:31,889
regular folk mess and messin with the

1124
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:33,179
science and they're like God you just

1125
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:36,059
you know just read the white papers and

1126
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:38,368
do what we say you know but especially

1127
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:41,150
when it comes to cannabis when for so

1128
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:44,338
long all of us growers were on our own

1129
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:46,619
because you know good educated folks

1130
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:49,710
like you were you know we're not

1131
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:51,300
available to us right and so I

1132
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:55,079
appreciate the fact that you know you

1133
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:57,180
encouraged us to experiment as well in

1134
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:00,358
speaking of experimenting you know I was

1135
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:03,000
in in preparation for this interview I

1136
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:06,989
went and I watched all your your prior

1137
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,550
interviews that I could find and during

1138
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:10,889
an in one of your interviews you

1139
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:14,460
mentioned that you have some secret

1140
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:16,379
sauce on using light to improve cloning

1141
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,420
success and and during that interview

1142
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,550
the interviews blew they blue right over

1143
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,289
it but I'm like oh that's totally what I

1144
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:24,480
want the part of it I wanted to hear so

1145
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:27,079
so will you share that with us like how

1146
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:31,139
can we better our-our cloning success

1147
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:35,670
with something about lights well I think

1148
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:38,789
that it's I think that most people kind

1149
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:40,829
of have an idea of what's going on and

1150
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:43,588
it's really kind of meeting the blue

1151
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:45,480
light thresholds you know people will

1152
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:47,039
talk about you know they'll just use

1153
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,349
metal halide or they'll use cool white

1154
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:52,018
fluorescent to do this

1155
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:54,180
and really it's a matter of making sure

1156
00:48:52,018 --> 00:48:56,038
that you meet the blue light threshold

1157
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:58,048
because if you don't we talked about

1158
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:59,940
this early on if you don't have enough

1159
00:48:58,048 --> 00:49:03,028
blue light the the plants will basically

1160
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:05,278
feel like they're their star they're in

1161
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:07,588
shade or something until the old long

1162
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:11,068
gate trying to get more blue light until

1163
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:13,219
they meet the threshold and so so it's

1164
00:49:11,068 --> 00:49:15,808
really important to get a light that has

1165
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:18,118
that blue light that meets that blue

1166
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:20,130
light threshold it's usually about kind

1167
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,608
of rule of thumb is about 30 micro moles

1168
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:25,170
per meter squared of blue light is

1169
00:49:23,608 --> 00:49:29,909
what's required so if you're trying to

1170
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:31,710
put out you know 300 or 400 micro moles

1171
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:34,469
per meter squared that means you're

1172
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:37,170
gonna probably want about 8 to 10% of

1173
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:38,759
blue light and so this is kind of where

1174
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,499
a lot of this stuff if you had high

1175
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:43,318
pressure sodium high pressure sodium

1176
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:44,848
only puts out about 5% blue light so

1177
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:47,579
this is kind of where some of the the

1178
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:50,239
ideas have stemmed from but if you if

1179
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:53,818
you figure out that threshold which is

1180
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:55,798
generally about 30 micro moles a blue

1181
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:57,838
light now you can really kind of

1182
00:49:55,798 --> 00:49:59,998
maximize that spectrum for efficiency

1183
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,179
and so once you maximize the efficiency

1184
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:04,679
then you're gonna get tremendous yields

1185
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:06,149
because you could you could really kind

1186
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:08,639
of create something that has that

1187
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:10,289
spectrum meeting the threshold but but

1188
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,389
putting all the energy in the high

1189
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:15,390
efficiency photosynthetically active

1190
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:17,608
region you would not be able to do this

1191
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:20,608
with with either the traditional lights

1192
00:50:17,608 --> 00:50:22,528
of hph HBS or metal halide right you're

1193
00:50:20,608 --> 00:50:28,078
gonna need some sort of led to do this

1194
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:29,608
nowadays right yeah yeah you know there

1195
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,349
are manufacturers that'll talk about you

1196
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:33,949
know they've got a special high-pressure

1197
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:37,440
sodium or something that has or you know

1198
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:39,838
more optimized for for growing but the

1199
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,400
reality is the spectrum the spectral

1200
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,558
power distribution of these things the

1201
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,479
way that they put energy is pretty much

1202
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:49,650
the same HB s versus a different HPS

1203
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:52,318
metal halide versus different metal

1204
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:55,019
halide it's really only LED that has

1205
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,869
this almost infinite might well I would

1206
00:50:55,018 --> 00:51:02,339
say it is absolutely infinite modularity

1207
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:05,309
of and configuration of what spectrum

1208
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:07,019
you could possibly have so for a cloning

1209
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:11,250
area you could have exactly the right

1210
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:14,190
spectrum that you need for a vegetation

1211
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:16,889
area exactly what you the right spectrum

1212
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:18,179
that you need for flowering just the

1213
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:21,059
right spectrum that you need and they

1214
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:24,480
all really kind of stems from a very

1215
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:28,110
specific blue light threshold it's all

1216
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,389
kind of the same so the reason why HBS

1217
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:31,800
works out well in a you know in the

1218
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:35,400
flowering room is because the light

1219
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:37,470
levels are so high if you're giving you

1220
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,160
know 600 plus micro moles per meter

1221
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:41,699
squared

1222
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:44,460
if 5% is blue you're still hitting that

1223
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:47,389
threshold of 30 micro moles of blue so

1224
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:50,010
that's that's why it still works there

1225
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:52,440
if you were to use lower light levels

1226
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:55,430
than that then you actually start seeing

1227
00:51:52,440 --> 00:52:00,570
morphological effects and not good ones

1228
00:51:55,429 --> 00:52:03,629
bad ones they start getting lanky or

1229
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:05,700
leggy if you will mm-hmm so I know that

1230
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:08,010
I'm about to suggest a really janky hack

1231
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:10,230
but I've seen it and so I'm probably

1232
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:15,180
gonna ask you you know I've seen people

1233
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:16,559
have HPS lights and they that they read

1234
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:19,679
something that they needed to increase

1235
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,509
their blue and so they took those you

1236
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,699
know they like the lighting the blue

1237
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:25,860
lighting gels from like a rot you know

1238
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:28,169
like a stagecraft like like going to see

1239
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:31,950
a band or something and and and they

1240
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:33,480
will put one of those you know over that

1241
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:35,279
and they're like look I just cover it up

1242
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:40,550
20% of my light with blue I just got a

1243
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:45,570
bunch more blue it is is that science no

1244
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:48,630
so you you know if you didn't get 30

1245
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:51,269
micro moles of blue without the filter

1246
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:53,010
the filter just removed it subtracts it

1247
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:55,320
doesn't add anything oh it's the

1248
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:58,770
opposite direction even so

1249
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:01,260
so yeah it's it shifted or its removes

1250
00:52:58,769 --> 00:53:03,059
the a lot of the red component out there

1251
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:07,170
but your light levels have just dropped

1252
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:08,699
significantly so I'd love to find

1253
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,000
someone where that actually worked but

1254
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:14,429
that that's not gonna work that is that

1255
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,789
is that is not a good idea right on well

1256
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:17,769
you know how it is with bro sign

1257
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:19,269
right I mean it's kind of its kind of

1258
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:21,429
the the other side of the coin just

1259
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:23,139
being a citizen scientist right it's

1260
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:25,779
like you know trying a bunch of stuff is

1261
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:27,879
great but then also you know a lot of

1262
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:32,220
the stuff that had been handed down from

1263
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:36,970
us from our you know from our mentors

1264
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:39,849
doesn't pan out long term yeah for sure

1265
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:42,609
so I know a lot of your work with light

1266
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:43,929
involves humans and and it was actually

1267
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,490
really interesting to listen to your

1268
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:47,409
interviews about you know human

1269
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:49,299
Lighting's and circadian rhythms and

1270
00:53:47,409 --> 00:53:50,440
then also then to hear you talk about

1271
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,840
the same thing in plants so I thought

1272
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,610
that was pretty cool but you know

1273
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:58,120
cultivation employees spend a lot of

1274
00:53:54,610 --> 00:54:00,940
time under a wide range of lights from

1275
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:04,059
you know from classic HPS and metal

1276
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:06,340
halide to LED and you know now even some

1277
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:10,150
folks are spending for the plasma lights

1278
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:13,030
so what impact does working under these

1279
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:15,970
sorts of artificial lights have on the

1280
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:17,890
humans that work below them and I'm

1281
00:54:15,969 --> 00:54:20,769
assuming that we can't just group them

1282
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:23,079
all in one category so like go category

1283
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:24,730
by category if you will because lots of

1284
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:26,289
cultivators listen to this show and I

1285
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:28,630
think they'd be curious to know what the

1286
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:32,710
lights they work under maybe doing to

1287
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:36,280
their to their human yeah well I would

1288
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:42,070
say that generally speaking from from a

1289
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:44,710
human circadian standpoint I guess that

1290
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:46,120
most people are very well educated on

1291
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,130
this but you know there's a lot of talk

1292
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:51,579
about blue light and its effect on honor

1293
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:53,440
sleep but basically there is a newly

1294
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:57,400
discovered photoreceptor that drives our

1295
00:54:53,440 --> 00:55:00,190
circadian rhythms and and really what

1296
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,670
the problem is is not so much the these

1297
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:07,360
grow environments but the regular dim

1298
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:09,099
lit office environment so we really kind

1299
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,860
of need to have brighter days and darker

1300
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:14,469
nights and in the built environment if

1301
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:17,800
you're in a gross space and in and

1302
00:55:14,469 --> 00:55:19,629
you're getting you know what it'd call

1303
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,370
it you know six seven hundred micro

1304
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:25,180
moles per meter squared that's a ton of

1305
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:26,949
light you know you don't need to be

1306
00:55:25,179 --> 00:55:28,309
convinced the fact that that is a ton of

1307
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:33,139
light so

1308
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:35,480
as if you are working a day shift in

1309
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:39,259
those spaces and you're getting a ton of

1310
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:43,099
that light that is a fantastic way to

1311
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:45,260
get the dose that you need of light for

1312
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:47,449
your day now if you're on a ship work

1313
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:50,210
schedule where you're going in after

1314
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:53,269
hours that light could absolutely

1315
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:54,920
destroy your sleep if that's a time that

1316
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:56,800
you're supposed it'd not be getting you

1317
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,809
know just like we talked about before

1318
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,690
plants could get altered their growth

1319
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:06,019
could get altered that could completely

1320
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:09,860
throw off your circadian rhythms making

1321
00:56:06,019 --> 00:56:12,650
it really hard to to to sleep that night

1322
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:15,079
but also the next three or four nights

1323
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:18,590
afterwards as a result of it it's kind

1324
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:22,279
of like that will be enough light to

1325
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:25,670
shift you to another time zone up to

1326
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,680
three hours later so so that is

1327
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:29,119
something that could dramatically impact

1328
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,730
your sleep so if you're getting that

1329
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,409
light exposure what I would actually

1330
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,179
recommend which is pretty simple if

1331
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:39,289
you're doing it after hours there are

1332
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:42,769
blue blocking glasses that exist you can

1333
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:44,779
buy them anywhere and actually we got

1334
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:47,179
some friends at a true dark that makes

1335
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:49,610
make some really good ones that block

1336
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:53,329
out all the blue light that would be a

1337
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:55,039
really good approach to to protecting

1338
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:56,599
yourself from getting too much of that

1339
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,210
daytime exposure at a time that you

1340
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:01,400
don't want to get it right on so let me

1341
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:03,409
unpack that a little bit so so I think

1342
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,139
you're saying that if if you're under

1343
00:57:03,409 --> 00:57:08,089
all that light during your regular day

1344
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:11,839
daytime let's say 9:00 to 5:00 shift

1345
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:15,380
you're actually winning because you're

1346
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:17,030
getting a ton of light you know you will

1347
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,800
not need a seasonal effectiveness

1348
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:21,650
disorder light box like you're getting

1349
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,240
all that at work and you're getting it

1350
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:24,680
at the right time in relationship to

1351
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,899
your sleep cycle so that when you go to

1352
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:30,559
sleep you'll be good to go to sleep yeah

1353
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:32,420
and and and then but if you if your

1354
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,059
second shift in the afternoon and you're

1355
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,829
still hoping to sleep at night you're

1356
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:39,829
kind of jacked because it's going to

1357
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:40,909
shift you off by 3 hours and disturb

1358
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:42,500
your night

1359
00:57:40,909 --> 00:57:44,659
let's say you're working the night shift

1360
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:47,869
if you work the night shift and you're

1361
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:50,719
sleeping during the daytime so your

1362
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:53,329
whole life is upside down will you be in

1363
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:56,179
good shape again because again you while

1364
00:57:53,329 --> 00:57:59,269
you might be on an artificial sleep

1365
00:57:56,179 --> 00:58:02,690
cycle that's not in jive with the planet

1366
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:04,848
you're actually set resetting your own

1367
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:07,909
circadian rhythm to night shift and

1368
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:09,829
you'd actually be okay again yeah so

1369
00:58:07,909 --> 00:58:11,989
that that's a that's a great question

1370
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:15,500
and it's it's it's the quandary that has

1371
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:19,608
plagued pretty much all shift work in

1372
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:21,619
all industries which is you know that's

1373
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:24,199
great we could totally do that and in

1374
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:26,900
this case you'll absolutely shift now

1375
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:28,969
the problem is what happens when you

1376
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,740
like live your normal life on your off

1377
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:34,879
days and stuff like that yeah because

1378
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:37,459
now maybe you're aligned with that that

1379
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,920
night shift but then you go out and

1380
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:41,659
normal life has a regular Sun that goes

1381
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,250
at a different time so now the Sun is

1382
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:46,190
the thing that completely throws off

1383
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:47,659
your schedule so so again it could be

1384
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:52,818
the exact same thing you wear those

1385
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:55,278
glasses when you go out in the Sun to

1386
00:58:52,818 --> 00:58:57,288
try to to try to minimize the disruption

1387
00:58:55,278 --> 00:59:00,230
that the the solar cycle is going to

1388
00:58:57,289 --> 00:59:01,940
have on you but really from a health and

1389
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:05,690
wellness standpoint what you want to do

1390
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:08,509
is try to create that same pattern same

1391
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:11,630
wakeup in sleep times over and over

1392
00:59:08,509 --> 00:59:13,400
again and unfortunately for some people

1393
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:18,170
that means you're you're kind of looking

1394
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:20,358
like a vampire on your off days so the

1395
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:22,099
the protection mechanism in all

1396
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:24,679
scenarios is to have some sort of blue

1397
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:26,900
blocking glasses to try to to try to

1398
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:28,818
make it to that light exposure at the

1399
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,769
wrong time doesn't doesn't throw your

1400
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:35,659
sleep cycles off kilter while we're

1401
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:37,788
talking about glasses and the eyes you

1402
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:40,278
know I don't spend a ton of time under

1403
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:41,869
cultivation lights but I know when I go

1404
00:59:40,278 --> 00:59:44,358
and I get tours and stuff and the tour

1405
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:46,670
goes especially long that when I leave

1406
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:50,000
sometimes my eyes feel tired like

1407
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:51,470
they've been worked too much and and I'm

1408
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,199
curious what

1409
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:57,529
you know being under intense light like

1410
00:59:54,199 --> 01:00:01,969
that as a full-time job might degrade

1411
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:04,130
the eyes are these are these spectrums

1412
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:06,019
that were growing under potentially

1413
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:08,150
dangerous for the eyes or is it just

1414
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,829
that I'm not used to that intensity and

1415
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:14,780
so when I go in it for a little while it

1416
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:19,369
tires my my eyes out yeah it's so I

1417
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:21,769
think that the the bigger thing is it's

1418
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:24,309
not the intensity it's not the spectrum

1419
01:00:21,769 --> 01:00:27,619
it's really kind of more the the

1420
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:29,509
gradient or the contrast it's you have a

1421
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:31,579
lot of bright and dark and your eyes are

1422
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:33,770
constantly trying to adjust to those if

1423
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:36,440
you think about being outside you know

1424
01:00:33,769 --> 01:00:38,420
it's usually you're either usually

1425
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,700
either shaded or you're you know in this

1426
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:43,280
bright you know ubiquitously bright

1427
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:44,750
space so it's nothing about the it's not

1428
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,700
nothing about the intensity and

1429
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:49,219
something really about the spectrum

1430
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:51,679
that's that's particularly harmful ful

1431
01:00:49,219 --> 01:00:53,598
what's causing this fatigue is Scott

1432
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:55,879
that your eyes are constantly going from

1433
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,849
a bright spot to a dark spot and it's

1434
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,410
trying to acclimate to these multiple

1435
01:00:57,849 --> 01:01:03,289
locations and and there's a little bit

1436
01:01:00,409 --> 01:01:05,629
of you know your eyes aren't acclimated

1437
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:09,289
to to that so there's a little bit of

1438
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:12,380
that but we know from the visual science

1439
01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:15,529
standpoint that high contrast ratios

1440
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:17,510
like you know it's just like when you

1441
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:19,070
when you watch it when you're watching

1442
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,349
TV at night and all the lights are off

1443
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:23,690
it it could be you know kind of glaring

1444
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:25,730
and off-putting but you just put a

1445
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:27,079
little bit of ambient light on and it

1446
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:29,150
makes that screen a lot more comfortable

1447
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:31,338
to see a lot of it has to do with the

1448
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:33,349
contrast ratios of light and dark that

1449
01:01:31,338 --> 01:01:35,389
you see so if I understand that right

1450
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:38,330
what you're suggesting is that actually

1451
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:40,608
it's the might like bite my pupils are

1452
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:42,949
tired that muscle or whatever it is that

1453
01:01:40,608 --> 01:01:45,529
meant that mechanism in my eyes it's

1454
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:47,299
it's it's opening and closing so much so

1455
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,760
it's closing when I'm directly under the

1456
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,470
light but then it's opening so when I go

1457
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,150
away from the light for a minute to take

1458
01:01:51,469 --> 01:01:55,039
something off of a shelf and bring it

1459
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,780
back to the light now it's back under so

1460
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,239
it's it's at that back and forth that's

1461
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:02,750
making my eyes tired that's right and

1462
01:01:59,239 --> 01:02:03,699
that that's super cool well like there's

1463
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,199
a con

1464
01:02:03,699 --> 01:02:08,259
you know there's actually a lot more

1465
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:11,289
fatigue on the cones itself because it's

1466
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:13,839
called lateral inhibition which is the

1467
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:16,929
contrast it amplifies a signal when it's

1468
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:19,179
contrasted against darkness so it's it

1469
01:02:16,929 --> 01:02:22,559
you're you're really giving your your

1470
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:24,789
cones and your eye a rollercoaster of

1471
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:28,449
emotion so it's a combination of that

1472
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:31,900
and the pupil your irises are kind of

1473
01:02:28,449 --> 01:02:34,449
going going back and forth so we talked

1474
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:36,010
about the the true dark glasses for

1475
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:40,149
people you know to help with their

1476
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:42,190
circadian cicle what what kind of a

1477
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:44,829
recommendation do you have for people

1478
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:46,750
who work under lights and so they have

1479
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:49,000
this experience of going back and forth

1480
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:50,980
from the bright environment to the

1481
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,050
darker environment and so they're their

1482
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:55,889
pupils are potentially getting tired at

1483
01:02:53,050 --> 01:03:00,820
work is there is there a hack for them

1484
01:02:55,889 --> 01:03:02,920
yeah I mean it should be just glasses I

1485
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,180
mean you want so with like the same kind

1486
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,470
of thing are we trying to cut out the

1487
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:07,899
blue or is it a different kind of

1488
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:12,189
glasses now and like the method 7s or

1489
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:13,358
something I'm I'm not sure if I know the

1490
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:15,818
method sevens

1491
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:18,400
what are those deal oh so they're just

1492
01:03:15,818 --> 01:03:21,068
often used for for folks and not only to

1493
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,660
to darken the eyes but from what I

1494
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:25,659
understand about the technology it's

1495
01:03:22,659 --> 01:03:28,088
it's it's taking out particular

1496
01:03:25,659 --> 01:03:30,250
spectrums the only the time that I

1497
01:03:28,088 --> 01:03:33,039
experience it most is when I'm trying to

1498
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:35,619
take photography in aggro and I get

1499
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:40,480
those those black bars on the

1500
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:42,940
photographs and so I had not used the

1501
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,539
method seven glasses I actually do use

1502
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:48,099
the method seven lens on my camera so it

1503
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:53,019
sounds like we may have waded into an

1504
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:55,300
area that that um yeah but I think that

1505
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:59,079
what's interesting those black bars are

1506
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:02,019
actually just a it's the DC ripple on

1507
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:06,510
your electrical current that interferes

1508
01:04:02,019 --> 01:04:10,179
with with the camera exposure usually

1509
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:11,880
I've seen on like iPhones and all you

1510
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:15,009
have to do is kind of change the

1511
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,720
aperture exposure and it'll it'll kind

1512
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:16,900
of wipe out I think iPhones really kind

1513
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,019
of

1514
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,519
fix that in software recently but that's

1515
01:04:20,019 --> 01:04:25,150
that's actually a really really

1516
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:28,929
interesting phenomenon on ripple current

1517
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:30,849
in your lighting system it it's nothing

1518
01:04:28,929 --> 01:04:32,919
wrong with anything that's going on but

1519
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:36,219
it's it's a it's just a conflict between

1520
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:38,769
the two electrical devices but I would

1521
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:41,049
say back to the main question is what

1522
01:04:38,769 --> 01:04:43,300
you do to try to if you're going on that

1523
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:46,450
back and forth is really just try to

1524
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,990
have overall intensity glasses if you

1525
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,909
can

1526
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:50,979
I don't think trying to filter out any

1527
01:04:48,909 --> 01:04:55,119
spectrum so that blue light is going to

1528
01:04:50,980 --> 01:05:00,010
is what drives your your what's called a

1529
01:04:55,119 --> 01:05:02,650
sustained pupil constriction so you

1530
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:05,710
probably don't want to have like a blue

1531
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:07,930
blocking glass because you know while

1532
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:10,389
that keeps your eye open it's also you

1533
01:05:07,929 --> 01:05:15,369
know letting a lot of that that light

1534
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:16,960
come in so so that's not good you really

1535
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:19,210
just want to lower the light level so

1536
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,639
what you're seeing in your office and

1537
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:25,389
what you're seeing in the grow space are

1538
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:27,190
close to the same so most most standard

1539
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:29,769
off-the-shelf glasses will cut ninety

1540
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:31,869
percent of the light level and that's

1541
01:05:29,769 --> 01:05:33,489
probably what you want to do there would

1542
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:37,239
then even though it certainly would

1543
01:05:33,489 --> 01:05:39,759
increase the the price of the operation

1544
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:41,679
just for the for this for the scientific

1545
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,450
basis would it would it then also make

1546
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,190
sense to let's say that you're in a

1547
01:05:43,449 --> 01:05:48,069
warehouse and you've got you know

1548
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:50,860
there's some part of it that is the

1549
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:54,100
artificial lighting for grows would it

1550
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:56,800
also make sense to pick up the you know

1551
01:05:54,099 --> 01:05:58,480
the ambient lighting of the entire space

1552
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,820
so there's less contrast just like your

1553
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,010
example watching television in the dark

1554
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,600
is not like the greatest idea of like

1555
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:07,510
perhaps the whole warehouse shouldn't be

1556
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:10,719
black except for the grow area yeah I

1557
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:13,150
mean that that is that's a great idea as

1558
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:15,939
well to to try to minimize those

1559
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:24,550
contrast ratios I mean I know this is a

1560
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:27,820
a non grow example but like in in

1561
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:30,670
buildings at least well designed ones

1562
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:33,370
they'll actually put if you have windows

1563
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:35,559
put light on the on the walls in between

1564
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:37,869
those windows to try to make sure that

1565
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:40,779
that says Brooke that wall in between

1566
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:43,739
the bright windows is as bright as it

1567
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:46,390
can be to minimize that contrast ratio

1568
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:49,419
well that's interesting you know it's

1569
01:06:46,389 --> 01:06:52,359
it's a I bet you it's only a matter of

1570
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:56,829
time before we start to see you know

1571
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:59,430
OSHA regulations around how bright the

1572
01:06:56,829 --> 01:07:02,319
ambient environment in cultivation

1573
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:05,859
warehouses have got to be just for the

1574
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:07,900
health of the employees yeah yeah I

1575
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:10,930
think that's that's interesting I mean I

1576
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:13,119
would say because we also do some work

1577
01:07:10,929 --> 01:07:14,619
with the Department of Energy that they

1578
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,679
would probably suggest that the glasses

1579
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:19,469
is probably the better solution then

1580
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:22,719
wasting all the extra electricity yeah

1581
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:24,489
yeah all right cool well let's go ahead

1582
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,169
and take our second short break we'll be

1583
01:07:24,489 --> 01:07:27,969
right back you are listening to shaping

1584
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:31,900
fire and my guest today is lighting

1585
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:33,819
scientist Robert solare in times like

1586
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,710
these when so many cannabis companies

1587
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:37,720
are growing their flower in gigantic

1588
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:40,119
warehouses and fields using synthetic

1589
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:42,009
nutrients it is good to know that there

1590
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,319
are authentic California heritage

1591
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:46,390
growers using natural farming techniques

1592
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:49,450
and sunshine to cultivate cannabis

1593
01:07:46,389 --> 01:07:50,769
flowers for you California has produced

1594
01:07:49,449 --> 01:07:53,169
the best cannabis in the world for

1595
01:07:50,769 --> 01:07:55,269
generations and the idea that massively

1596
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:58,480
scaled industrial cannabis production

1597
01:07:55,269 --> 01:08:00,969
could produce the same quality as small

1598
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,360
batch lovingly cultivated flowers is

1599
01:08:00,969 --> 01:08:06,279
just silly moon time medicinals is

1600
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,860
located in Humboldt County on the lush

1601
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:11,230
South Fork of the eel River watershed in

1602
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:13,750
the epicenter of the American cannabis

1603
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:16,000
heartland moon time medicinals

1604
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:18,489
grows under bright california sun in

1605
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,949
greenhouses using only natural farming

1606
01:08:18,489 --> 01:08:23,199
techniques like google culture compost

1607
01:08:20,949 --> 01:08:26,380
teas whole food fertilizers and

1608
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:28,420
fermented plant juices every part of

1609
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:30,400
their growing process plays its own part

1610
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:33,159
in nature and nothing synthetic is

1611
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:35,679
injected into the process the result is

1612
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:38,409
big beautiful cannabis flowers with

1613
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:41,530
wide-ranging terpene profiles that taste

1614
01:08:38,409 --> 01:08:43,659
like great cannabis should if you live

1615
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:44,979
in California ask your bud tender for

1616
01:08:43,659 --> 01:08:47,649
moon time Madison

1617

top-shelf cannabis grown in harmony with

1627
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:17,289
nature one of the reasons why no-till

1628
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:19,329
cannabis growing is so valued by farmers

1629
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:21,369
is because the mycelium networks in the

1630
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:23,559
soil remain established from year to

1631
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:25,539
year and we know these fungal networks

1632
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,789
are essential because they are the

1633
01:09:25,539 --> 01:09:29,500
nutrient super highways that extend far

1634
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,009
and wide in the substrate to feed your

1635
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,798
plants

1636
01:09:30,009 --> 01:09:34,960
the trouble with growing in new soils or

1637
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:37,028
blended cocoa substrates is that it

1638
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,909
takes most of the plants life just to

1639
01:09:37,029 --> 01:09:42,400
create these mycelium highways Dino

Michael endo mycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1641

reduces that time and gets your plant

1642
01:09:45,009 --> 01:09:50,229
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

1643

1652
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:12,130
vigorously trialed by cannabis and food

1653
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:14,620

1654
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:15,760
product first arrived here last year you

1655
01:10:14,619 --> 01:10:17,738

environment of indoor greenhouses can be

1683
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,900
the best of both worlds for many

greenhouse operators though building

1685
01:11:26,899 --> 01:11:30,979
their greenhouse before gaining insight

1686
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:33,169
into how cannabis greenhouses differ

1687
01:11:30,979 --> 01:11:36,529
from ornamental crops can be the start

1688
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:38,750
of a world of hurt Eric Branstad and his

1689
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:41,029
team at greenhouse advisory group have

1690

Branstad has been helping cannabis

1693
01:11:45,229 --> 01:11:49,788
growers find locations design build and

1694
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:51,679
equip their greenhouses for over a

1695
01:11:49,788 --> 01:11:53,658
decade first starting in Northern

1696
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,578
California but expanding over the last

1697
01:11:53,658 --> 01:11:57,439
five years to helping clients throughout

reputation for both depth of knowledge

1700
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:03,828
and kindness and communication you can

1701
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,599
hear Eric explains some of the

1702
01:12:03,828 --> 01:12:07,849
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses

1703
01:12:05,599 --> 01:12:09,770
and how to overcome them in episode

1704

number forty one of the shaping fire

podcast no matter where I go in the

1706
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:16,609
country good people with smart

1707
01:12:14,809 --> 01:12:19,250
backgrounds still are making the mistake

1708
01:12:16,609 --> 01:12:21,348
of building without knowing cannabis and

1709
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,729
it causes them to burn through capital

1710
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:24,619
and time fast

1711
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:26,509
everyone has their fill and failure

1712
01:12:24,618 --> 01:12:28,578
point for some it is improper

1713
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:30,230
ventilation planning for others it is

1714
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:32,960
surface temperatures of the building or

1715
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:34,339
the plants leaves or both some folks

1716
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,500
that build our greenhouse from scratch

1717
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:38,449
make really basic errors like placement

1718
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,710
of the greenhouse on the property or not

1719
01:12:38,448 --> 01:12:41,328
understanding the natural environment

1720
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:43,639
where the greenhouse sits

1721
01:12:41,328 --> 01:12:45,799
some have even built a decent greenhouse

1722
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:47,300
but are inefficient in their deployment

1723
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,599
of light deprivation techniques and

1724
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:51,949
never really hit their target yields

1725
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:53,719
it's great when you learn from your

1726
01:12:51,948 --> 01:12:55,969
mistakes but it's even better when you

1727
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:58,130
learn from the mistakes of others when

1728
01:12:55,969 --> 01:12:59,809
you bring on greenhouse advisory group

1729
01:12:58,130 --> 01:13:01,699
you will learn from the mistakes of

1730
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:03,320
their many clients and you'll take

1731
01:13:01,698 --> 01:13:05,509
advantage of the best practices

1732
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:07,340
developed by Eric Branstad over his

1733
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:10,250
years of working with clients just like

1734
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,719
you from location development to

1735
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:13,099
choosing a builder and

1736
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:15,170
freaking out your new greenhouse or

welcome back you are listening to

1743
01:13:27,979 --> 01:13:31,820
shaping fire I'm your host Shango losan

1744
01:13:30,408 --> 01:13:34,698
our guest this week is lighting

1745
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:35,960
scientists Robert solare so Robert one

1746
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:37,728
of the things that I've heard you say a

1747
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:41,840
couple times on your other interviews is

1748
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:43,940
that you know people and plants see

1749
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,860
light differently and that seems like

1750
01:13:43,939 --> 01:13:48,078
the kind of phrase that you like kind of

1751
01:13:45,859 --> 01:13:50,929
throw out there but that there's a whole

1752
01:13:48,078 --> 01:13:52,130
hell of a lot behind it and so I just

1753
01:13:50,929 --> 01:13:53,899
want to go on a little fishing

1754
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:56,328
expedition with this phrase that you use

1755
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:58,629
often what do you mean by plants and

1756
01:13:56,328 --> 01:14:03,649
humans seeing the light differently oh

1757
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:08,449
yeah I mean so I guess anyone who's

1758
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:10,819
familiar with early day LED light will

1759
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:13,009
show you know it's a purple light right

1760
01:14:10,819 --> 01:14:14,448
so or pink light and it's just comprised

1761
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:17,960
of blue in red well that's because

1762
01:14:14,448 --> 01:14:23,118
plants which are green reflecting sea

1763
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:25,819
blue and red most efficiently and people

1764
01:14:23,118 --> 01:14:28,848
actually see green most efficiently so

1765
01:14:25,819 --> 01:14:32,529
on a high level so there are things that

1766
01:14:28,849 --> 01:14:37,400
are what people see which are kind of

1767
01:14:32,529 --> 01:14:39,198
Luxor or lumens that's how we see light

1768
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:42,728
this is how we quantify how bright

1769
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:45,319
something is well plants which use ppfd

1770
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:47,719
see things differently but I think that

1771
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:51,049
it's even more complicated than that

1772
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:52,309
because when we talk about say comparing

1773
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:54,498
different light fixtures like a

1774
01:14:52,309 --> 01:14:57,829
high-pressure sodium light fixture or a

1775
01:14:54,498 --> 01:15:01,309
metal halide or an LED the way that

1776
01:14:57,828 --> 01:15:05,118
those spectral compositions are will see

1777
01:15:01,309 --> 01:15:08,719
them maybe like we could have a metal

1778
01:15:05,118 --> 01:15:12,738
halide that looks like we'll call it a

1779
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:14,929
5000 Kelvin color which is very cool

1780
01:15:12,738 --> 01:15:17,569
white light and we could get an LED that

1781
01:15:14,929 --> 01:15:19,849
matches it and so they look they could

1782
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:21,469
look the same to us but the plants

1783
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:23,900
actually will look at those lights and

1784
01:15:21,469 --> 01:15:25,550
they're very very different and so the

1785
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:27,979
it's all about these spectral

1786
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:30,619
power distribution of how that all works

1787
01:15:27,979 --> 01:15:32,719
out that that is really what you want to

1788
01:15:30,619 --> 01:15:35,210
think about when you're deciding what

1789
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:38,900
kind of LED light or whatever kind of

1790
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:41,779
lighting technology you have to that's

1791
01:15:38,899 --> 01:15:44,059
gonna work best for your grow so when

1792
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:45,710
you look at hyper sodium that doesn't

1793
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:48,490
mean you need an LED replacement that

1794
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:50,720
looks the same that means you you know

1795
01:15:48,489 --> 01:15:52,599
you might get better performance out of

1796
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:55,250
something that doesn't look the same

1797
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:58,220
same goes true with the with the metal

1798
01:15:55,250 --> 01:16:00,229
halide is that what the plant sees and

1799
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:04,039
what we see are fundamentally different

1800
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:06,439
and so we can't look at a light and say

1801
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:08,630
oh that's gonna perform you know really

1802
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:11,419
well or really poorly just because what

1803
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:13,640
my eye sees and this is really true as

1804
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:16,190
we start getting into the infinite

1805
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:20,329
possibilities that LED light provides

1806
01:16:16,189 --> 01:16:23,359
for us so if we can't use our eyes to

1807
01:16:20,329 --> 01:16:26,210
judge the spectrum and while that makes

1808
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:27,920
like intellectual sense to me you know

1809
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:30,289
I've been in plenty of grow rooms where

1810
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,840
the cultivator has told me that you know

1811
01:16:30,289 --> 01:16:34,579
that there but for example like bulbs

1812
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:37,369
get tired over time right and they'll

1813
01:16:34,579 --> 01:16:39,920
tell me oh the bulbs getting tired I can

1814
01:16:37,369 --> 01:16:42,380
tell because the spectrum is different

1815
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,880
and while you know I certainly defer to

1816
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:46,760
their experience and it's their grow

1817
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:48,859
room is that enough of a salty subtlety

1818
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:50,300
and change of an old bulb changing

1819
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:52,159
spectrum that they'll actually be able

1820
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:58,100
to see with this technology we have that

1821
01:16:52,159 --> 01:17:00,380
our eyes so with the older technology

1822
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:02,660
absolutely a metal halide will change

1823
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:06,350
and changes color once it gets

1824
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:08,449
quote-unquote tired and that's a visible

1825
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:10,789
change that it's a direction we can see

1826
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:15,409
that is a visible change in those

1827
01:17:10,789 --> 01:17:18,380
changes will so a new metal halide

1828
01:17:15,409 --> 01:17:20,599
versus old metal halide will get a

1829
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:23,180
little bit of a shift but that's not

1830
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:26,510
nearly as significant as what its gonna

1831
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:28,600
have versus an LED light spectrum and so

1832
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:30,860
what it comes down to is really kind of

1833
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,200
understanding the buckets of light that

1834
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:35,839
they have how much percentage of blue

1835
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:38,000
light you have how much percentage of

1836
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,078
red light you have and so when you're

1837
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,090
thinking of

1838
01:17:39,078 --> 01:17:44,149
you got to think about it in those terms

1839
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:47,539
and it all comes back to kind of hitting

1840
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:49,819
this threshold of you know a certain

1841
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:51,408
number of blue and this is really kind

1842
01:17:49,819 --> 01:17:56,029
of what drives most of the morphological

1843
01:17:51,408 --> 01:17:58,339
effects is I need you know again rule of

1844
01:17:56,029 --> 01:18:01,550
thumb about 30 micro moles as my minimum

1845
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:03,170
of blue light so when I measure light

1846
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:05,389
and weight think about how much light

1847
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:08,270
I'm gonna put out there you know if I

1848
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:10,670
have 20% blue light you know that's

1849
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:12,679
probably gonna do good enough if I have

1850
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:15,920
5% blue light that's probably gonna be

1851
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:19,969
pushing the boundaries of what I'm gonna

1852
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:22,239
get and so as I mentioned before hyper

1853
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:25,099
sodium has low amounts of blue

1854
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:26,928
metal-halide has you know higher amounts

1855
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:29,210
of blue fluorescents will have higher

1856
01:18:26,929 --> 01:18:32,719
amounts of blue an LED could be

1857
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:35,328
absolutely anything it really depends on

1858
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:37,819
what you what you're trying to do and

1859
01:18:35,328 --> 01:18:41,448
LED is is much more of an engineered

1860
01:18:37,819 --> 01:18:44,058
light source an engineered solution to

1861
01:18:41,448 --> 01:18:46,428
try to bring the benefits of those other

1862
01:18:44,059 --> 01:18:48,770
technologies but in a very targeted way

1863
01:18:46,429 --> 01:18:51,230
that's giving the light on the plant the

1864
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:53,510
right spectrum that it needs at the

1865
01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:55,939
right time and and just trying to to

1866
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:59,179
tailor that spectrum to what the plant

1867
01:18:55,939 --> 01:19:01,789
needs and at the basically benefit of

1868
01:18:59,179 --> 01:19:06,199
energy efficiency all right so let's

1869
01:19:01,789 --> 01:19:10,219
take this back one one step so if if

1870
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:14,299
there are limits to the usability of our

1871
01:19:10,219 --> 01:19:18,948
eyes to determine spectrum for those of

1872
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:22,730
us who are not lighting nerds what are

1873
01:19:18,948 --> 01:19:27,379
the tools that a cultivator would use to

1874
01:19:22,729 --> 01:19:29,299
measure these light attributes that the

1875
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:30,469
that the eyes cannot handle so if you

1876
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,489
know you've got these deep you know

1877
01:19:30,469 --> 01:19:33,469
you've got buckets and you've got

1878
01:19:31,488 --> 01:19:35,479
intensity what are the tools of the

1879
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:37,099
trade if you will for those of us who

1880
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:39,828
don't spend a lot of time with lights

1881
01:19:37,099 --> 01:19:42,590
yeah so I mean it's it's pretty simple

1882
01:19:39,828 --> 01:19:44,808
if you have high pressure sodium there

1883
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:48,199
are rules of thumbs metal halide is

1884
01:19:44,809 --> 01:19:52,760
about 15% blue high pressure sodium is

1885
01:19:48,198 --> 01:19:53,988
about 5% blue and so just think

1886
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:57,139
about it like that and then if you're

1887
01:19:53,988 --> 01:20:00,979
thinking about you know what LEDs gonna

1888
01:19:57,139 --> 01:20:04,010
do to replace either one of those think

1889
01:20:00,979 --> 01:20:06,169
about what's gonna have a similar blue

1890
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:10,010
light percentage as those two things

1891
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:14,170
five or 15% and that's what you want to

1892
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:18,110
match and so when you go to any credible

1893
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:19,190
LED lighting manufacturer that's the

1894
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:21,170
number that you want to have they should

1895
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:24,049
have published on there the percentage

1896
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:26,149
of blue light on their specification

1897
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:28,159
sheet and that's what you need to think

1898
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:31,939
about is if you're thinking about it for

1899
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:34,488
a for a flower space where you're gonna

1900
01:20:31,939 --> 01:20:37,518
have high pressure sodium normally you

1901
01:20:34,488 --> 01:20:39,618
want to have at least 5% blue which the

1902
01:20:37,519 --> 01:20:42,889
majority of them all do and if you want

1903
01:20:39,618 --> 01:20:45,488
to have something that is for a metal

1904
01:20:42,889 --> 01:20:48,469
halide or a cool for fluorescent space

1905
01:20:45,488 --> 01:20:51,468
you want to make sure that you're north

1906
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:52,760
of 15% so you actually took that in a

1907
01:20:51,469 --> 01:20:55,730
different direction that I thought I

1908
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,260
thought you I didn't realize that you

1909
01:20:55,729 --> 01:21:00,229
know I mean I I knew that the lights

1910
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:02,210
were sold with full spec sheets I mean I

1911
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:04,928
get that part but I actually thought you

1912
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:09,590
were gonna say oh we use these hand-held

1913
01:21:04,929 --> 01:21:12,408
technologies to to measure the the

1914
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:15,679
buckets of you know the spectrum and

1915
01:21:12,408 --> 01:21:17,689
then we go back and we just adjust our

1916
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:22,010
lights but what I'm kind of getting the

1917
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:25,279
idea is is that this the spectrum is

1918
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:27,530
going on most lights the spectrum is

1919
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:31,849
going to come hardwired and so you want

1920
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:34,399
to buy the spectrum from from from the

1921
01:21:31,849 --> 01:21:35,989
jump from from day one it isn't like

1922
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:37,488
you're gonna buy your light and then

1923
01:21:35,988 --> 01:21:40,729
tune your spectrum for what you

1924
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:42,229
personally like in your grow that's

1925
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:44,029
that's right I mean there are ways that

1926
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:45,279
you could do it again you're gonna pay

1927
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:48,288
through the nose for it

1928
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:51,948
you know those meters that that can do

1929
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:54,889
it are you know a couple thousand

1930
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:56,118
dollars for a meter that that could tell

1931
01:21:54,889 --> 01:21:57,440
you what the spectrum is and then you

1932
01:21:56,118 --> 01:22:00,799
don't really know what to do with it

1933
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:04,759
afterwards really it comes down to very

1934
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:05,820
simply saying okay if this is I just

1935
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:08,130
need to meet a minute

1936
01:22:05,819 --> 01:22:11,519
minimum criteria so that things don't

1937
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:13,380
get weird in my grow and so it's just a

1938
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:19,170
matter of looking at the spec sheet and

1939
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:21,510
usually what I've seen is that every LED

1940
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:24,779
light has kind of hit the threshold of

1941
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:27,930
what the minimum needs is minimum needs

1942
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:31,829
are for either one you might come across

1943
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:34,950
one that you know doesn't have enough of

1944
01:22:31,829 --> 01:22:37,550
the the blue light content but by and

1945
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:40,949
large they almost all do nowadays

1946
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:43,260
hmm well it's that's nice that way it's

1947
01:22:40,949 --> 01:22:47,369
a lot harder to screw up that's for sure

1948
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:49,320
yeah so um so as you and I talked about

1949
01:22:47,369 --> 01:22:51,449
before before we got going today you

1950
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:54,149
know I do a lot of work with patients

1951
01:22:51,449 --> 01:22:56,760
and and you know while while a lot of

1952
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:59,699
folks are you know focused on commercial

1953
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:01,320
cultivation my pate my passion will

1954
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:03,329
still always be with like these little

1955
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:06,869
home growers trying to give them self

1956
01:23:03,329 --> 01:23:08,939
relief and it is incredibly common for

1957
01:23:06,869 --> 01:23:10,949
them to have these like like these

1958
01:23:08,939 --> 01:23:12,839
little plastic greenhouses or hoop

1959
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:15,210
houses where they've they you know taken

1960
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:18,390
some kind of skeleton of wood and they

1961
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:21,840
wrap it around in plastic and you know

1962
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:24,270
you know I know from interviewing Eric

1963
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,940
Branstad the greenhouse specialist that

1964
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:30,230
you know at the very least we want to

1965
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:32,579
use four year or horticultural plastic

1966
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:34,619
but a lot of people are you still using

1967
01:23:32,579 --> 01:23:36,899
plastic sheeting you know just from Home

1968
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:38,489
Depot if thinking that well it keeps the

1969
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:40,559
plants dry

1970
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:44,670
would you tell it to just a little bit

1971
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:48,270
about what what the different plastics

1972
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:51,890
will do to the light when it hits our

1973
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:54,990
plants and maybe even more importantly

1974
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:56,400
how we will experience that in the

1975
01:23:54,989 --> 01:24:00,300
plants that were growing for our

1976
01:23:56,399 --> 01:24:05,239
medicine yeah sue that's that's a really

1977
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:10,170
good question so generally speaking

1978
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:12,840
plastics or design plastics don't do

1979
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:15,600
well with UV and we kind of talked

1980
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:18,360
earlier one of the one of the key

1981
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,420
benefits of sunlight is the UV that's

1982
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:21,189
going on to the

1983
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:24,730
their stuff that's happening out there

1984
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:27,009
in the in the non-visual region so a

1985
01:24:24,729 --> 01:24:30,250
horticultural grade lighting is going to

1986
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:33,100
is going to do better I'm sorry a

1987
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:34,899
horticultural grade plastic is going to

1988
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:37,120
do better it's going to understand that

1989
01:24:34,899 --> 01:24:39,179
those far ends of the spectrum are

1990
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:44,529
important and try to allow them through

1991
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:47,319
the cheaper plastics are not and they

1992
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:49,059
are not going to consider what those

1993
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:53,079
ends of the spectrum are going to do for

1994
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:55,239
for the plant and generally they're

1995
01:24:53,079 --> 01:24:56,979
going to be not the best outdoor rated

1996
01:24:55,238 --> 01:24:58,589
and what will happen you'll notice that

1997
01:24:56,979 --> 01:25:00,879
they'll start yellowing over time

1998
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:02,890
they'll start becoming very brittle and

1999
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,900
so that yellowing is going to take a lot

2000
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:06,730
of the blue out of the spectrum it'll

2001
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:08,979
drop the overall intensity but it's

2002
01:25:06,729 --> 01:25:11,289
going to take out all the UV all the

2003
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:12,549
blue light is the yellowing is the

2004
01:25:11,289 --> 01:25:15,189
yellowing in the plastic or in the

2005
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:17,020
plants the I'm sorry yeah the yellowing

2006
01:25:15,189 --> 01:25:20,319
is in the plastic okay please continue

2007
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:23,320
yeah so the plastic we yellow and that

2008
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:25,329
that means it's attenuating more of the

2009
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:28,750
UV it's attenuating more of the blue

2010
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:31,689
light and so it's so now the plants not

2011
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:34,869
getting things that are vital for it's

2012
01:25:31,689 --> 01:25:37,960
for normal growth right on then I would

2013
01:25:34,869 --> 01:25:40,840
strongly advise to get a horticultural

2014
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,698
grade plastic I love it that's that is

2015
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,869
the the decision rule that I was looking

2016
01:25:42,698 --> 01:25:46,269
for there because you know how it is

2017
01:25:43,869 --> 01:25:47,890
like when you're working with you know

2018
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:50,110
any kind of a home grower whether it's

2019
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:53,410
cannabis or vegetables there are so many

2020
01:25:50,109 --> 01:25:56,049
variables and so many people don't have

2021
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:57,429
complete knowledge that you go and you

2022
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:59,369
see and you're like okay they've got

2023
01:25:57,429 --> 01:26:02,109
they've got the they have non

2024
01:25:59,369 --> 01:26:04,659
horticultural plastic and they're their

2025
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:06,130
plants are not doing well but it could

2026
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:08,859
also because they screwed up some other

2027
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:12,100
variable right sure so it's good to hear

2028
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:14,019
without any question that not only does

2029
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:16,660
it make a difference but it makes a big

2030
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:19,510
enough difference where you know it's

2031
01:26:16,659 --> 01:26:21,880
definitely worth spring in for the extra

2032
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:25,119
money to get the proper plastic that's

2033
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:27,640
right yeah all right so hey before we

2034
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:29,979
before we wrap up here I want to I want

2035
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:31,079
to ask you one question specifically

2036
01:26:29,979 --> 01:26:33,659
about LED

2037
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:37,260
so you know you know even though you're

2038
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:38,489
an LED expert you know I really wanted

2039
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:40,680
to have you on the show today more

2040
01:26:38,489 --> 01:26:43,739
because you are a lighting and and

2041
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:47,010
horticulture scientist and at the same

2042
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:51,119
time you know there's a big competition

2043
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:54,210
in our scene between LEDs and and the

2044
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:55,590
traditional light mediums and you know

2045
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:57,630
they're they're kind of like street

2046
01:26:55,590 --> 01:27:00,000
gangs like they do not play soft really

2047
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:04,109
people get get angry if they are

2048
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,329
dedicated to HPS and and you do and put

2049
01:27:04,109 --> 01:27:08,609
out any kind of LED content and then on

2050
01:27:06,329 --> 01:27:10,079
the flip the LED people i'll find

2051
01:27:08,609 --> 01:27:12,509
themselves you know much more

2052
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:14,970
sophisticated and educated and they talk

2053
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:16,500
all this trash about the HPS people and

2054
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:19,770
I'm all like hey man I have had really

2055
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:23,430
kick-ass flowers of both but I do know

2056
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:25,200
that LED has kind of just kind of come

2057
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:27,630
into its own right there there's a lot

2058
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:30,659
of flowers over the last 20 well I'll

2059
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:32,789
say 12 years that that I've had from LED

2060
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:37,470
that just just didn't rock my world

2061
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:41,159
right and so as as somebody who you know

2062
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:43,530
does LED engineering and you know but

2063
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:47,519
also understands the fundamentals and

2064
01:27:43,529 --> 01:27:49,319
and why people choose HP s what are your

2065
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,100
thoughts on the threshold point like

2066
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:55,619
have we passed that threshold point now

2067
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:59,490
where LEDs have gotten to the point with

2068
01:27:55,619 --> 01:28:02,789
spectrum and intensity efficiency of

2069
01:27:59,489 --> 01:28:06,859
electrical usage and and price come

2070
01:28:02,789 --> 01:28:11,519
competition where even the most hardcore

2071
01:28:06,859 --> 01:28:13,259
HPS people should start to like like you

2072
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,900
know at least read some websites about

2073
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:18,600
the LED stuff because we've passed this

2074
01:28:15,899 --> 01:28:22,049
threshold because you know I have now

2075
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:23,700
had LED flower that is fabulous and and

2076
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:26,340
while there's this whole secondary thing

2077
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:27,630
about electrical usage in in my mind I'm

2078
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:30,360
looking forward to the day where we can

2079
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:31,920
have solar-powered indoor right and I

2080
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:33,210
and I know we got we got a while we got

2081
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,680
a you know there's there's some

2082
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:38,399
technologies that need to get developed

2083
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:40,500
but um you know I prefer growing

2084
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:42,960
outdoors because the sunshine is free

2085
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:44,020
but the day will come where we can do

2086
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,300
solar powered in

2087
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:47,770
and so then so then it's all going to be

2088
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:50,230
on the technology and it's going to

2089
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:52,770
decrease the question of efficiency will

2090
01:28:50,229 --> 01:28:54,279
be out the door so with that very

2091
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:57,700
significant and yet potentially

2092
01:28:54,279 --> 01:29:00,869
convoluted setup where do you see that

2093
01:28:57,699 --> 01:29:05,099
threshold point is and have we passed it

2094
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:08,739
yeah so the threshold point really was

2095
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:11,320
can LED lighting serve as a thousand

2096
01:29:08,739 --> 01:29:13,149
watt HPS replacement and I think until

2097
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:17,769
just very recently the answer has been

2098
01:29:13,149 --> 01:29:19,420
no and so what I think that the majority

2099
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:23,640
of people who have kind of been

2100
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:28,779
naysayers of LED have either been burned

2101
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:30,930
from generations past or they've just

2102
01:29:28,779 --> 01:29:34,059
kind of heard about it or they've

2103
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:36,760
they've kind of got this stigma that it

2104
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:42,970
just can't put out the the output and

2105
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:44,860
anyone who's who said that say five

2106
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:48,420
years ago were a one hundred and one

2107
01:29:44,859 --> 01:29:52,389
hundred percent correct I think that the

2108
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:54,430
lighting industry did them well some

2109
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:57,070
people in the LED lighting industry did

2110
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:59,140
themselves just gave themselves a black

2111
01:29:57,069 --> 01:30:01,630
eye by trying to say it was a thousand

2112
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:04,030
watt HPS replacement by you know putting

2113
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:06,100
a meter directly underneath it and going

2114
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:08,050
see you get the same light levels but no

2115
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:11,110
one's thinking about what happens at ten

2116
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:14,680
degrees from underneath that light

2117
01:30:11,109 --> 01:30:17,319
source but now they have reached that

2118
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:20,260
threshold where they can and and it has

2119
01:30:17,319 --> 01:30:23,049
been you know not everyone could do it

2120
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:27,130
it's a it's a thermal exercise to try to

2121
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:28,949
get all that heat out so so there's a

2122
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,869
fundamental difference between how

2123
01:30:28,949 --> 01:30:35,470
traditional lights work like high

2124
01:30:31,869 --> 01:30:37,809
pressure sodium versus LED high pressure

2125
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:40,030
sodium it you know it has a certain

2126
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:44,170
amount of efficiency and whatever else

2127
01:30:40,029 --> 01:30:46,689
is waste heat is is heat and it radiates

2128
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:49,329
that heat LEDs are different because

2129
01:30:46,689 --> 01:30:52,989
what is waste heat is actually conducted

2130
01:30:49,329 --> 01:30:53,939
away sorry do I need to go over that

2131
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:56,619
again

2132
01:30:53,939 --> 01:30:58,429
did you hear my phone ring just now uh

2133
01:30:56,619 --> 01:31:01,430
no no I did okay

2134
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:08,960
I call it no no we got it okay I'm so

2135
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:11,930
and what happens is when when that he is

2136
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:15,199
conducted away it takes a certain amount

2137
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:20,810
of a thermal like device in order to get

2138
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:23,630
that heat away but what I could say very

2139
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:27,230
certainly is that LED has been able to

2140
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:29,810
to hit that threshold and go over that

2141
01:31:27,229 --> 01:31:33,289
hurdle of really truly being a thousand

2142
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:36,950
watt high pressure sodium replacement so

2143
01:31:33,289 --> 01:31:39,260
there's you know you know I have a

2144
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:42,229
company and and my company does it but

2145
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:43,869
we're not the only one so there are you

2146
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:47,089
know kind of these Tier one

2147
01:31:43,869 --> 01:31:49,970
manufacturers that can absolutely hit

2148
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:53,539
these thresholds and if you you know if

2149
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:57,170
you were a naysayer you know you're a

2150
01:31:53,539 --> 01:31:59,510
smart man but the time has come for LEDs

2151
01:31:57,170 --> 01:32:01,310
to kind of hit hit that threshold and I

2152
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:04,130
would say if you're looking for a very

2153
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:08,710
specific threshold if it could get over

2154
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:12,100
1600 micromoles per per second

2155
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:14,090
preferably 1750 micromoles per second

2156
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:15,230
that is going to be something that

2157
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:17,810
you're going to have a really good

2158
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:20,449
experience with fantastic that is a

2159
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:22,370
great answer so Robert our time is done

2160
01:32:20,449 --> 01:32:24,229
thank you so much for all of this

2161
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:26,449
interesting information and some of the

2162
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:28,579
you know atypical insights that we don't

2163
01:32:26,449 --> 01:32:31,159
usually hear when you know people are

2164
01:32:28,579 --> 01:32:33,890
either talking about strictly the botany

2165
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:36,050
or strictly the light technology your

2166
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:38,150
your ability to kind of weave those two

2167
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:40,070
together to provide some some answers

2168
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:42,019
that straddle both disciplines was

2169
01:32:40,069 --> 01:32:44,420
really enjoyable so thank you very much

2170
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:44,840
yeah thanks for having me I really had a

2171
