00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,320
we humans have been enjoying psychedelic

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,320
mushrooms for so long that it may have

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,000
even been before we were Homo sapiens

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,079
and even though most of us get our

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,600
mushrooms from our weed dealer they

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:24,239
really are nature and occur outside and

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,840
grow nearby in the forest for free you

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,358
just have to be really clear in your

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,480
identification so you don't end up dying

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,239
we may be taking mushrooms to talk to

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,520
God but that doesn't mean we want to see

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,238
God in person after accidentally eating

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,680
a truly poisonous

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,599
mushroom today's episode is about a

16
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:43,159
special group of psilocybin mushrooms

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,520
who love growing on hardwood and how you

18
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:48,279
can Wildcraft them and also grow a patch

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,680
in your yard or your neighbor's yard or

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,399
your local park if you want to learn

21
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,039
about cannabis Health cultivation and

42
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,640
there he created the first Sops for

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,719

Provisions mushroom farm in Olympia

53
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,560
Washington Provisions is the first CSA

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,159
supported agriculture mushroom farm in

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,199
the United States he sells over 1,000

56
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,120
pounds of culinary mushrooms per week

57
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,799
through local farmers markets grocery

58
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,519
stores and restaurants he also produces

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,800
tinctures and various melium and

60
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,560
mushroom products for wholesale and

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,760
Retail finally Christian maintains a

library for food and medicinal

64
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,599
production his company is so respected

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
that his internship opportunities are

66
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,079
accredited by The Evergreen State

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,400
College during the first set today we

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,400
will learn about the wood loving

69
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,560
mushrooms who they are and how they

70
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,760
function in the second set we will

71
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,360
discuss wildcrafting wood lovers their

72
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,399
ecology and responsible harvesting and

73
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,480
during the third set we go step by step

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,840
through creating and sustaining a wood

75
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,560
loving siloc cybin mushroom plot at home

76
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,519
welcome to shaping fire

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,878
Christian it's great to be here thank

78
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,840
you excellent so let's get right into it

79
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,560
so you know for for folks whose

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,120
familiarity with mushrooms stops at um

81
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,959
like are they hallucinogenic or not

82
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,480
let's create a little bit of context to

83
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,878
bring everybody on the same page you

84
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,039
know people talk about these mushrooms

85
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:17,759
as as psilocybin mushrooms kind of

86
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:20,079
generally but the genus is pilos and so

87
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,919
let's start with that context would you

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,440
give us a quick summary of the pilos

89
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,598
genus of fungi and and maybe a little

90
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,239
bit of their

91
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:32,759
characteristics yeah definitely I like

92
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:35,400
to kind of categorize the different

93
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,679
species in the philosopy genus in three

94
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,438
different categories

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,519
basically wood lovers that we want to

96
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,199
talk about

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,920
today Co Tropic or coprophilic mushrooms

98
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:52,318
that like manure feces and also grass

99
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,759
loving varieties and some can be

100
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,318
intermixed like the they're all

101
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:01,878
basically sapat trops that like a dead

102
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:04,518
or decaying materials substrates but

103
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:09,438
some will also integrate in manure and

104
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:12,000
grass and some just in wood so I I think

105
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:15,438
um those are distinguishing factors that

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,279
are kind of delineate all the slos of em

107
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:21,040
mushrooms is is the fact that they have

108
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:23,959
psilocybin a key attribute of them I

109
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,520
would think that since pilos is the name

110
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,959
you know is in the name of the genus

111
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,599
that would be true but I don't know that

112
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:33,758
to be

113
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:37,560
true yeah they they vary in potency but

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,759
generally all cilos mushrooms have

115
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,160
psilocybin okay so you've given us like

116
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,160
these three General baskets in cilos the

117
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,919
the wood lovers the manure lovers and

118
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,560
the grass lovers so so we're going to

119
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,399
focus on the wood lovers today so I

120
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,240
think our next step would be to identify

121
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:57,679
that next smaller basket if if if those

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,600
three are all part of the soloc genus

123
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,639
what would you say are the attributes

124
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,680
specifically of the wood

125
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,519
lovers they all have very similar

126
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,600
phenotypes uh there's different varying

127
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,639
potencies the more research that we do

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,400
on

129
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,120
analyzing the constituents the

130
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,318
psychoactive properties in these species

131
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,360
we'll find that they each have differing

132
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,080
compounds and differing potencies but

133
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,400
generally the wood lovers all have very

134
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:35,800
similar characteristics their stem uh

135
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:39,079
morphology and their their caps all have

136
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,918
kind of a similar resemblance the spores

137
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,198
so they they all are distinguished

138
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,639
that's why they're in that

139
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,879
distinguishable category basically

140
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,000
they're so similar it sounds like not

141
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,519
only are there morphological

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,360
similarities between them meaning they

143
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,399
look the same but the more science we're

144
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,919
able to do on them we're probably also

145
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,159
going to find a lot of similarities in

146
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,519
the chemistry of them as that as that

147
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,600
research gets done I'm guessing

148
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,598
definitely that you know their their

149
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,879
caps may vary you know some are more

150
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,360
rounded some are pointed on top some are

151
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,879
a little more Brown some are more

152
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,199
caramel cap some are even white so there

153
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,360
are some very

154
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:24,439
macroscopic big differences within the

155
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,919
wood lovers but they are very you know

156
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:32,519
similar that we we're discovering a lot

157
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:36,879
still today and so you know out of

158
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:40,359
around two 250 300 different species in

159
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:43,120
the cocy genus you know I think we're

160
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,639
dealing with close to a dozen or so in

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,079
the wood lovers that we know of so

162
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,598
there's still a lot to learn and that's

163
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,598
exactly where I'm going next you know is

164
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,560
is how many of these you know how many

165
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,959
of the wood lovers exist I I I know I I

166
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,478
mean at least I don't think that's a

167
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,000
scientific definition I think that's

168
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:03,000
more like a uh um convenience definition

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,199
but when I was doing my homework for the

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,120
program um some people were suggesting

171
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,240
like oh there are you know there there

172
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,680
are only really three main wood lovers

173
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,800
and then there's a couple rare ones and

174
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,400
then somebody else like oh there's

175
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,598
really five major wood lovers and then

176
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,519
there's the rest of them but you know

177
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,598
you know in my research I came up with

178
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,000
like 11 and so I don't know whether or

179
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,159
not you know there are 11 or like a 100

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,560
and I only found 11 but but you're

181
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,199
you're suggesting that there's really 12

182
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,199
that really like fit the definition eh

183
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,160
yeah I'm you know taxonomy isn't my

184
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,840
strong suit so I'll just put that out

185
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,879
there right off the bat I'm specialized

186
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,959
in

187
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:50,000
cultivation so um I leave a lot of these

188
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:53,519
bigger taxonomy questions to the

189
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,879
taxonomist out there but yes the on

190
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,878
average you know we're finding more and

191
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,199
more every year and so that number is

192
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,439
changing

193
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,560
and as well as the taxonomy work that's

194
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,158
being done we're finding that those

195
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,759
scientific names are changing too so

196
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:14,560
what we thought was sosop bohim is now

197
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,479
being correlated to

198
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,038
ca and so the names change as well as

199
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:22,038
the discoveries and that really is a

200
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,800
confusing thing in science too you know

201
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:27,038
um I have a long history of keeping uh

202
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,079
freshwater fish aquariums and it was

203
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,918
always weird when we I'd go to like you

204
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,639
know the the Seattle Aquarium club

205
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,759
meetings and they'd announced that you

206
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,360
know some fish had changed from one name

207
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,439
to another and we're all like what the

208
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,080
hell man and and I can imagine that that

209
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,800
you know that happens in every branch of

210
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,519
science I actually have got bohemica in

211
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,838
my notes and also CA in my notes and

212
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,080
didn't realize that they were the same

213
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,959
thing I have a feeling that's probably

214
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,959
going to happen for a while yeah just

215
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,919
ever increasing more people out there

216
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:59,879
hunting looking for new species there's

217
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:03,159
more collaboration online on all the

218
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:06,278
different websites that are documenting

219
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,439
the data so it's really exciting so so

220
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:09,919
if we're you know we're not going to

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,000
necessarily go into every one of the the

222
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,479
12 wood lovers uh specifically but just

223
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,559
for like name recognition um would you

224
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,120
just tell us the names of some of the

225
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:22,599
real Cornerstone wood lovers that that

226
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,480
people tend to have access to and

227
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,720
like yeah there's you

228
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,959
know starting from the top some of the

229
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:36,680
most mushrooms are the wood lovers

230
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:38,319
solos aurescent in the Pacific Northwest

231
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,239
known as one of the most

232
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,800
potent also in the southern hemisphere

233
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,600
in New Zealand Australia you have

234
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:50,479
solos sub

235
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:53,000
orosa which is also they say probably

236
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,639
equally as potent as the azur rescence

237
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,639
just on a different part of the world so

238
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,000
it it all comes down to like we talked

239
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,639
about before for the

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,480
analysis of um the compounds are going

241
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:08,799
to come out more and more of of what

242
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,399
variety is going to be more potent over

243
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,799
time as we include all the different

244
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,078
precursors to

245
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,519
psilocybin um you know like we talked

246
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:22,199
about bohemica is kind of next the

247
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,440
ca the uh cyan Essence also here in the

248
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,480
Pacific

249
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,760
Northwest the thing about wood lovers is

250
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,839
now that we have more interest around

251
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,078
the world World both in

252
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,800
cultivation and in

253
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:38,919
identification that these these

254
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,278
mushrooms are being distributed

255
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:43,599
worldwide and so their habitats are

256
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,399
changing what used to be found just in

257
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,200
the Pacific Northwest is now found in

258
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,639
Central Park in downtown New York City

259
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,200
because people have taken samples of the

260
00:10:51,639 --> 00:11:00,560
culture or the spores and transfer them

261
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:04,160
as they travel or maybe mistakenly or

262
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,078
directly um consciously so we're

263
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,319
starting to see all these different

264
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:13,759
varieties be distributed all over the

265
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:17,480
world so um yeah I I think like I would

266
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:21,720
say to name a few others uh the spring

267
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:25,800
solos known as ooid or the ovoid

268
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:29,120
cytia found in Ohio Pennsylvania area

269
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:31,199
was recently discovered uh well it was

270
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,759
discovered a while back but the taxonomy

271
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,600
work was just recently

272
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:40,120
done and uh the aleni also was something

273
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,079
that was discovered by John Allen back

274
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,799
in the 80s and

275
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:49,278
then kind of got back into circulation

276
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:52,759
around 2004 2005 and

277
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:55,240
now Alan Rockefeller and his crew have

278
00:11:52,759 --> 00:12:00,679
done the taxonomy work on that and

279
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:02,680
renamed it to solos elenia to kind of

280
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,199
celebrate John Allen's work over the

281
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:08,039
years that's cool that's cool you know

282
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,440
the with with many species one of the

283
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:14,278
things that controls their geographic

284
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,079
location is the fact that they work in

285
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,639
any particular bio region but the wood

286
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:22,319
lovers the thing that they have in

287
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,639
common is um the habitat and I would

288
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,240
think that um any anywhere that you're

289
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,600
going to find one of these species um

290
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,600
bringing in another wood lover species

291
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,879
is likely to catch on there as well

292
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
because what the the habitat they need

293
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,159
is so similar is that a is that a

294
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,399
realistic assumption I'm making

295
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:46,679
definitely I've seen multiple species in

296
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,519
one location so there's they they love

297
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,799
the same habitat for the most part some

298
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,879
might like grassier areas you know the

299
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:57,519
Azure Essence is typically found on the

300
00:12:53,879 --> 00:13:02,198
coast near Wood and sedge grass so

301
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,919
there's different kind of symbiotic or

302
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:09,120
not symbiotic but just

303
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,159
synergistic kind of symbiosis of uh

304
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,519
growing

305
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,519
mediums and so as long as you have wood

306
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,639
though generally these varieties are

307
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,639
going to

308
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,278
thrive to to anthropomorphize it they um

309
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,278
they they they they may all be

310
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:25,639
scientifically love wood lovers but they

311
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:28,919
do have their own

312
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:31,320
personalities oh yeah definitely both

313
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:34,120
both in in you know what you get

314
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,160
internally as well as macroscopically or

315
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,759
microscopically yeah so let for for most

316
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,639
people the reason why these wood levers

317
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,759
matter and come up on their on their

318
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,159
radar is because they have cybin in them

319
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,039
and they are um you know they're

320
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,799
hallucinogenic and so whether or not

321
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,480
somebody is looking to have a you know a

322
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,359
hallucinogenic experience or whether or

323
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,800
not they're looking to micro do it's

324
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,399
that attribute that they are most

325
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:05,159
interested in and for me you know I have

326
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,159
come across you know all the other

327
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,879
salasi genus mushrooms way more than I

328
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,639
have come across the wood lovers in my

329
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,159
own life which is you know V variable

330
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,560
like for example where I live on Vashon

331
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,958
Island if if if you were one of the kids

332
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,599
who grow grew up here on Vashon the

333
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,439
mushroom that you've been most in

334
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,440
contact with is cyan Essence because

335
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,360
they grow abundantly here on the island

336
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,480
but like I didn't live somewhere where I

337
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,120
knew

338
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,199
you know that there were naturally

339
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,480
occurring mushrooms so so the mushrooms

340
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,559
that that I came across were all uh

341
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,800
cultivated indoors and so where I'm

342
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,719
going with this is that um I'm curious

343
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:46,278
to know you know when you compare them

344
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,480
do the wood lovers produce psilocybin in

345
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:51,720
in comparison to the amounts of

346
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,199
psilocybin that we find in other pilos

347
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,440
cultivated varieties like you know

348
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,799
golden teacher and penis envy like like

349
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,320
can they compete with these very popular

350
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,838
uh mushrooms on

351
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,120
potency oh yeah they're more than likely

352
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,199
more potent uh depending on the the

353
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:14,519
species of the wood lovers Azure Essence

354
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:17,958
sub orosa is up to 1% more

355
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:21,078
potent when you know you're looking at

356
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,559
uh superactive species is going to have

357
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:27,719
about

358
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:32,719
1% uh Sil cybin content in uh dried form

359
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:36,360
so if um you have almost a 1% degree

360
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,920
increase in psilocybin content from that

361
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,759
initial potency of 1% that's a a

362
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:46,399
significant amount the thing that

363
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:50,000
changes the experience internally is all

364
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:55,559
the precursors to psilocybin so what's

365
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:59,318
actually happening is uh sosin is being

366
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:05,039
def phosphorated in our body and um

367
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:07,838
created into siloc cybin so this is um

368
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,439
it depends so cues a lot of times have

369
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,680
equal parts psilocybin and equal parts

370
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,360
pelosin so this is why you're getting

371
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,399
kind of an extreme experience in cubes a

372
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,639
lot of times which is different than

373
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:26,120
some of the more potent wood lovers

374
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,480
because you have more psilocybin than

375
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,278
sosin in some of these wood lovers so

376
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,680
as

377
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:34,879
we learn more and have more research in

378
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,559
dialing

379
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,720
in what what's happening with these

380
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:44,119
precursors in our experience Bostin

381
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,720
neurobiotin are basically identical

382
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,278
twins to serotonin and these are all

383
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,199
acting on our the same serotonin

384
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:55,679
receptor we we'll find

385
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:59,318
the you know the potencies are different

386
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:01,919
as we of course um take them person to

387
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,159
person but also mushroom to mushroom and

388
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,798
species to species depending on those

389
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,919
different precursors and constituents

390
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,199
rayon if I understand you correctly what

391
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:15,079
I think you're what you're saying is

392
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,959
that um you know even though some of the

393
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:21,519
wood lovers are more potent in

394
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:24,000
psilocybin cubensis have the experience

395
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,759
of being more potent for some people

396
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,200
because the wood lovers are very

397
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:32,720
psilocybin rich and S cbin is a what do

398
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,400
they call it a a prodrug which means

399
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,960
that it's it's a drug that we take in

400
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,200
our body and then our body turns it into

401
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,240
something that is actually the

402
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,279
hallucinogen in this case sosin right so

403
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,759
so psilocybin is in the mushroom and

404
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:49,240
it's the pro drug and then and then we

405
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,960
eat it and our body turns it into sosin

406
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,160
which is really what gives the

407
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,360
experience and so cubensis instead of it

408
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,720
being you know 8020 psilocybin into

409
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,759
soloin for example ex Le it's more like

410
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,440
50/50 so that when you take a cubensis

411
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,720
you are having the experience more

412
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,400
intensely and faster because it's

413
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,960
already got soloin on board ready to

414
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,640
give you an experience exactly I think I

415
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,600
said that backwards initially I said

416
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,520
sosin turns into psilocybin but I meant

417
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,959
like you were saying psilocybin being

418
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,839
def phosphor related into soloin right

419
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,319
on um honestly it's very helpful for me

420
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:32,279
to hear the word solos

421
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:34,839
uh stated by an actual myologist too

422
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:38,639
because so many of us we we learn from

423
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:40,359
books right and so um uh you know whe

424
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,799
I've discussed this before on the show

425
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,319
whether or not it was uh sisin or sosin

426
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:46,480
or whatever but I wasn't talking with my

427
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:48,599
colist and we're like I don't know and

428
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,200
we're not the right people to ask you

429
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,759
know when it comes to the Latin versions

430
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,960
I no no one's really an expert on

431
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,960
pronunciation it it kind of just goes

432
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,038
with what a whatever feels comfortable

433
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,319
these days so soloin or solasan or you

434
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:08,879
know however we say or tomato or tomato

435
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:11,480
kind of thing right on Fair good so um

436
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,480
so if if if we call Wood Lovers Wood

437
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,079
lovers um are mushrooms that are not

438
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,440
wood lovers would we just call those

439
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,839
like regular or would we call them

440
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,798
manure lovers or grass lovers it's just

441
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:25,558
a simple way of how to talk about this

442
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,000
casually is it like wood lovers and like

443
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:30,678
regular mushrooms or or is wood lovers

444
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,798
so not actually scientific that that it

445
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,480
wouldn't actually be used in a

446
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:38,918
conversation anyway I've kind of seen it

447
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,120
as wood lovers are categorized as that

448
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,080
and everything else is kind of in its

449
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:47,879
own category you we talked about being

450
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:50,439
coer Tropic or copper philic that's kind

451
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,720
of a technical term for manure

452
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,558
lovers so you know you could say that

453
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,038
those censes in particular are copper

454
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:01,918
tropic

455
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,679
but um I I have never really

456
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,159
differentiated it like regular mushrooms

457
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:10,320
or wood lovers um they they kind of just

458
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:13,799
are what they are and I think as we

459
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,798
progress into research and and knowing

460
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,359
more about these different species that

461
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:21,240
maybe different names will come about

462
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,519
right on so um I want to I want to save

463
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,079
um more most of our time from this first

464
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,480
set for the second and third set which

465
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:28,359
are going to be much longer due to the

466
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,798
nature of the questions but they the

467
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,918
last thing I want to ask you before we

468
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:34,599
go to our first commercial break and I

469
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,679
and I want to readily admit that we may

470
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:39,359
not have a good answer for this so so if

471
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,519
that's true feel free to say it but you

472
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,918
know like I want to talk about like the

473
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,798
secondary uh alkaloids in Wood lovers um

474
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:50,720
you know there's a lot of excitement

475
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:54,679
about um about uh the the rest of the

476
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,480
soloc genus in that uh you know they

477
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,200
they've got the these aromatics and

478
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,839
Tarpin that we know are so so important

479
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,400
in cannabis and we're just now beginning

480
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:07,158
to study them in in mushrooms and then

481
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,880
also there's all these like secondary

482
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,120
alkaloids that are are rich and we can

483
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,000
we can test for them in Labs but we

484
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:18,038
don't really know what they do and so my

485
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,359
my question for you is um are is that

486
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:22,359
same does that same excitement apply to

487
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:26,079
Wood lovers as well that they've got

488
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:30,119
this same uh aromatic and secondary you

489
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:33,480
know biochemical um story to tell where

490
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:36,199
they too are are going to be receiving a

491
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,079
lot of aromatic research to find out

492
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,558
what on Earth they're doing other than

493
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:43,639
just delivering us uh

494
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:46,359
psilocybin I agree I think all mushrooms

495
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,120
are in this category you know even if

496
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,719
they're culinary mushrooms or the

497
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,079
functional mushrooms as they call them

498
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,480
today Lion's

499
00:21:52,079 --> 00:22:01,359
man uh shitake and others very aromatic

500
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,480
turpine rich I think too that uh the

501
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,158
amino

502
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,519
acids um deriving from tryptophan uh for

503
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,400
these tryptamine alkaloids are extremely

504
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,480
exciting there's all kinds of new

505
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,360
research that's happening this is

506
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,360
research that was done clear back in the

507
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:23,399
60s by a friend of mine Albert L long um

508
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:26,399
discovered beo syy with another

509
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,759
colleague and uh Arc Paul I believe his

510
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,600
name is and

511
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,599
the research stopped you know it we we

512
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,719
could have been so far along 40 years

513
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:40,199
later practic you know

514
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:43,278
406 almost 50 years uh it's really sad

515
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,319
but now we're here and I'm hopeful that

516
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,759
yeah we're going to find

517
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:51,240
more uh research uh we're going to find

518
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,519
more data that's telling us you know

519
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,960
exactly what all these different amino

520
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,558
acids are doing maybe why they're there

521
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,759
what the function is of it and how can

522
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,678
we use this in mental health and other

523
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:06,079
things for our physiological wellbeing

524
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,759
well-being as well as like getting to

525
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,558
know ourselves and

526
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,640
um

527
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,278
and understanding who we really are and

528
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,600
what we're doing on this

529
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:20,200
planet right on so all right so let's go

530
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,599
ahead and and take our first commercial

531
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,400
break so so our first set was all about

532
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,798
like you know uh getting to know what

533
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,519
we're talking about today in the wood

534
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,079
lovers but during the second set we're

535
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,879

536
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,798
Wildcraft cultivation and in the third

537

know without these advertisers shaping

544
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,278
fire would not happen so please support

545
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:50,389
them and let them know that you heard

546
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:52,240
about them on shaping

548
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,440
fire revenue is tight for cannabis

549
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:58,439
businesses right now there is no

550
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,558
question about it and when when Revenue

551
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,038
tightens businesses need to spend

552
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:05,000
Smarter on Advertising instead of

553
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,879
throwing obscene money at Hanging your

554

company's logo from the rafters at your

555
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,080
next convention perhaps consider placing

556
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,158
commercials on shaping fire and if you

557
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,038
are a very small business there is

558
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,600
simply no better bang for your buck than

559
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:20,200
commercials on shaping fire especially

560
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,439
if your products are for regeneratively

561
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,840

562
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,640
cultivators advertising on this show

563
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,038
allows us time to talk about your

564
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,640
product service or brand in a way that

565
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:32,200
really lets people know what sets your

566
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,159
company apart from the others bold

567
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,798
people who own companies know that

568
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,399
getting into relationship with their

569
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:41,000
customers is essential that is what we

570
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:43,719
offer we will explain your service or

571
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,599
product what sets it apart as desirable

572
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,038
and help our audience get in contact

573
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,480
with you it's pretty simple really

574
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:52,558
advertising does not have to be all

575
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,640
whizbang smoking mirrors nowadays I find

576
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,000
that people prefer just to be spoken to

577
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
calmly accurately and with good

578
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,679
intentions

579
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,000
if you want to make your own commercial

580
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,000
spot you can do that too with a

581
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,720

that they will start to flower at 16 1/2

613
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:24,798
hours of daylight instead of the typical

614
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,079
14 1/2 hours of daylight that means in

615
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,839
most regions your plants will start to

616
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:31,599
flower out outdoors in the middle of

617

July instead of the middle of August

618

663
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,399
which further enhanced nutrient

664
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,719
availability for the plants because

665
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:36,000
plants are limited by the absence of any

666
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,558
essential micronutrient these Trace

667
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,519
nutrients are the difference between

668
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,158
having a decent garden and having a

669
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,200

00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:56,038
base of nutrients not all fish poop is

675
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,359
created equally most products with added

poop welcome back you are listening to

697
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,480
shaping fire I am your host Shango Los

698
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,720
and my guest today is myologist

699
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,919
Christian Kalin so before the break we

700
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,038
were talking about wood lovers who they

701
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:04,640
are what they are and where we tend to

702
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:06,119
find them in literature but now we're

703
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,720
going to talk about where we tend to

704
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,639
find them in the wild so we're going to

705
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,399
talk more about wildcrafting here so you

706
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,880
know Christian I've I personally have

707
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:17,879
only ever heard of wood lovers being

708
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,240
grown outside whenever I hear about wood

709
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,919
lovers people are talking about either

710
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,599
wildcrafting them literally you know

711
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,278
walking into the forest and looking for

712
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:30,839
them or doing a version of I don't know

713
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,720
wild cultivation where people are you

714
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,879
know intentionally inoculating their

715
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,960
yard so so you know they're outside

716
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,320
they're not inside but maybe they're one

717
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,319
step less wild because they're you know

718
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:42,960
because they are intentionally

719
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,319
inoculated or not but um they always

720
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,319
seem to be you know these wood lovers

721
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:50,439
always seem to be more of a wild type

722
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:53,038
mushroom versus the ones growing indoors

723
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,720
is there any like scientific reality to

724
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:58,398
that or is that just me and how I've

725
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,759
come to know wood lovers

726
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:04,319
no you're right that they are generally

727
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:06,079
found Outdoors there is however a lot of

728
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,519
experimentation that's been going on

729
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:12,079
over the last decade or so even maybe

730
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:16,759
longer with trying to grow some of these

731
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:18,678
varieties indoor with decent success it

732
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:21,398
takes longer you you have to go through

733
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,240
like a multi-seasonal kind of situation

734
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:28,759
so uh but for the most part yes you're

735
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:33,440
right uh found outside uh in the wild or

736
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:35,960
in landscape habitats as well as people

737
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,558
intentionally making patches outside

738
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:43,440
right so so this habitat that generally

739
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:46,638
happens Outdoors because it it it it is

740
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,320
it needs to have seasons and it needs to

741
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:51,678
have a big spance of time what are these

742
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:55,278
habitats that are most conducive to the

743
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,159
gross to the growth of Wild Wood loving

744
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:02,960
psybin mushrooms

745
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:07,159
Hardwoods deciduous trees the those uh

746
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:11,319
substrates generally any kind of wood

747
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:15,639
substrate leaves that fall off trees and

748
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:18,678
create more substrate these are places

749
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:20,079
where you'll find um the aurescent

750
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,880
actually like we talked about before are

751
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:26,278
found on the beaches out on the coast

752
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,200
connected to Wood drift that's in the

753
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:34,000
sand more than likely on top of s

754
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,399
Grassroots so yeah but technically the

755
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,519
the habitats are generally very similar

756
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,959
grassy

757
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,919
Woody and you want to stay away from the

758
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,840
Conifer Evergreen wood that is too

759
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,799
acidic they they they don't do well

760
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,240
there you could combine if you didn't

761
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:50,480
have enough wood sometimes you can get

762
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,960
away with combining a little bit of

763
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,519
hardwood with some Conifer chips to make

764
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,278
patches work but generally just found

765
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,200
around the deciduous trees yeah I have

766
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,278
definitely not found any success using

767
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,200
you know pine chips before you know when

768
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,240
I was a younger man and I did not

769
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,840
realize the important of the hardwood I

770
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,919
would get frustrated I'm like why why

771
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,678
isn't there these this you know pine

772
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,080
tree working and it's like yeah wrong

773
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,960
wrong game Shango um so so all right so

774
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,759
it sounds like you know we're looking

775
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,319
for edges of things like kind of like

776
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:27,440
where where the the coastal grasses meet

777
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:30,000
the coastal sand with wood and and where

778
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,080
the forest with the forest Duff meets

779
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
the grass and it it's it sounds like a

780
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:37,879
lot of these are are are found in areas

781
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,319
where there's a transition and so there

782
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,278
are different varieties of nutrition and

783
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:46,398
habitat involved yeah definitely they're

784
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:48,638
secondary metabolizers too so they're

785
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,239
used to being kind of second on the

786
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:52,719
scene they they love to be first on the

787
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,759
scene if you're intentionally trying to

788
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,839
make patches and they'll do even better

789
00:33:54,759 --> 00:34:01,200
that way but where you find them is

790
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:03,918
taking the last bits of the of the

791
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,159
substrate and digesting it and then

792
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,159
producing fungus or mushrooms from that

793
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,159
so when you say not the first one on the

794
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,280
scene um you're talking about that there

795
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,838
are other mushroom varieties that are

796
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,599
the first one on the scene right yeah

797
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,239
either micro risal that are in the roots

798
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,760
of the trees and plants or other sapat

799
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:26,039
tropes that are competing for the top

800
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,800
layer of lignon and cellulose right on I

801
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,800
I've always liked the idea of mushrooms

802
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,560
that there's so many varieties that

803
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,960
really Excel when they're playing well

804
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:37,679
with others you know yeah I think you

805
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,599
can have some symbiotic relationships

806
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,000
there that are synergistic and then you

807
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,960
can have others that are definitely out

808
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
competing each other MH so let's talk

809
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,119
about uh the climate and seasonal um

810
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,239
effects because you know that's one of

811
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,599
the reasons why indoor cultivation of

812
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:59,879
wood lovers is so challenging and why

813
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,800
people work so meticulously to try to um

814
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,320
you know make a synthetic environment

815
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,000
that replicates these Seasons indoors so

816
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,359
so you know what is their what is the

817
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,880
mushrooms life cycle uh generally and

818
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:16,400
when do they fruit and and what kind of

819
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,680
environmental conditions do they like

820
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,280
other than just purely the location that

821
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:23,519
we've already

822
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,359
discussed they yeah they can be very

823
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,320
finicky uh when you're trying to

824
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,440
cultivate them

825
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,480
uh mushrooms in general a lot of times

826
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,159
I've noticed when people stress out

827
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,400
trying to grow them they want them to

828
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:38,519
grow so bad sometimes I feel like this

829
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,680
is too much of a stressful environment

830
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:45,759
on the organism it sounds crazy but yeah

831
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,480
um just letting like trying to see what

832
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,280
happens in nature and mimicking that

833
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:54,280
same thing basically just setting up you

834
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,680
know knowing what the species is so

835
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,640
basically breaking it back down into

836
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,000
three different categories you need a a

837
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:01,838
good culture something that you've

838
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,358
either found in the wild you can do stem

839
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,159
butt transfers uh you take the The Roots

840
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:08,199
off the bottom of the stem put it into

841
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,440
wet cardboard or other substrates and

842
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:16,318
let that culture kind of grow through

843
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:20,440
and um transplant that into other new

844
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:21,480
substrates um you know there's uh places

845
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,838
out there where you can start with

846
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,480
spores you know spores generally are

847
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,799
legal so you can if you know what you're

848
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,199
doing

849
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,560
um you can you know start from Spore and

850
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:36,279
then have that broadcast out into a

851
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:38,400
patch but generally um most of these

852
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,040
wood lovers fruit in the fall so you

853
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,639
want to time it either 6 months to a

854
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:47,559
year before that harvest date so before

855
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:49,318
we go too far into the cultivation cuz

856
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:51,358
all of third set is going to be about

857
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:54,000
cultivation okay I want to I want to I

858
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:58,078
want to uh narrow our scope a little bit

859
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,159
specifically about the seasons and um

860
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,519
you know we have we have mentioned you

861
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,480
know that there's a whole bunch in the

862
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,039
Pacific Northwest right which which

863
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,960
tells me they like moisture a lot right

864
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:10,679
and then there then there are varieties

865
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,720
like the ooids which are coastal East

866
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:16,078
Coast right which also tells me that

867
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:18,759
they really like wet um but then you

868
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,880
were talking about um some variety

869
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:25,480
earlier in the show where they're

870
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,480
actually in the Midwest and so um uh

871
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,599
what is going on climate wise in all

872
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,400
three of these places which which um you

873
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,880
know creates this great environment for

874
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,880
wood

875
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,880
lovers the the wood lovers love a cold

876
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,760
snap a winter kind of situation with

877
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,480
like you're

878
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:51,280
saying a humid nice wet environment

879
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,960
so if you don't have this cold snap

880
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,640
seasonally this can change your Harvest

881
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,960
year toe in your wild uh you know your

882
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:03,358
wild harvesting

883
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,720
foraging or also when you're

884
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:09,759
intentionally trying to make

885
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:12,000
patches um that timing of how your melum

886
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,079
is digesting your patch how much food

887
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,199
source you know you've given it there's

888
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,359
a lot that goes into the timing of both

889
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:23,439
your melium growing in the substrate and

890
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:25,880
the seasonality of your season it's it's

891
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,039
not always certain that you're going to

892
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,838
get mushrooms you're playing outside is

893
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:34,199
playing with nature you're playing with

894
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:37,719
nature both in the culture and in your

895
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:39,759
temperature and humidity outside so

896
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:42,000
basically setting up a patch like we'll

897
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,319
probably talk about here in a little bit

898
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,039
will um the the location your culture

899
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:53,000
and the substrate are the three main

900
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:57,079
issues with setting up a a

901
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,838
a a patch a patch that is um going to be

902
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,400
successful do we know why the cold snap

903
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,078
is so relevant to the fungus I mean

904
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,119
there's I'm guessing that there's some

905
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,240
mechanism internal to the mushroom that

906
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,000
without the cold snap it doesn't have

907
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,039
the gumption to um fruit as much um when

908
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,280
it's

909
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:20,079
time yeah there's a lot of even culinary

910
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,880
mushrooms are similar shitaki rely on a

911
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:28,079
cold kind of uh primordial stage where

912
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,039
the melium needs to get almost shocked

913
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,119
uh it needs to come out of its normal

914
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:37,559
character and then that stresses the

915
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:40,200
melium out to induce Fring so these are

916
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,519
and this can be oxygen related CO2

917
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:46,000
related temperature related or humidity

918
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:48,000
related so a lot goes into it similarly

919
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,280
you know they're they these mushrooms

920
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,318
like the moisture but then there's a

921
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,160
certain point when there's so much rain

922
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:56,880
that um that the mushrooms are done for

923
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,960
the season right so do we have any

924
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,318
understanding of of why the mushrooms

925
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,079
like you know x amount of moisture

926
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:07,838
versus X Plus moisture like do we

927
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,200
understand at all what the biology is

928
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,639
where the the the mushroom finally says

929
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,358
all right there's just too much rain

930
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:15,239
we're

931
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:18,519
done you know it's a lot of times

932
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:22,000
temperature instead of moisture that

933
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:24,920
terminates the end of the season I found

934
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,039
the yes if you have kind of if you have

935
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,519
an intentional patch outside

936
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,960
that isn't deep in like you know a foot

937
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:35,239
or more of substrate then you're more

938
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,679
susceptible to either drying out with

939
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:42,719
lack of water or being too swamped with

940
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:46,919
too much water but the wild varieties

941
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:49,118
are just in nature they're they're more

942
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,318
permeable to these

943
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,079
fluctuations and as long as it doesn't

944
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:55,318
freeze freeze like a hard freeze

945
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:57,359
generally is what terminates the

946
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:00,159
season you know that makes a lot of

947
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,119
sense to me I I actually saw the biggest

948
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:05,358
um sin Essence patch I have ever

949
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:08,920
personally seen um this year and I was

950
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:10,719
really surprised to find it in um in

951
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,920
January right because that's awfully

952
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:15,039
late here for the Pacific Northwest for

953
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,240
S Essence and my friend called me over

954
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,159
and said here you got to come over and

955
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,519
check this out and it ended up being

956
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:23,559
this like this very large outcropping

957
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,838
maybe like 10 ft by 8 ft and it was just

958
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:28,039
like just like you know I probably

959
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,159
shouldn't say thousands but like a whole

960
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,519
bunch were were there like the most I've

961
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,480
ever seen and and I said what you know I

962
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:37,440
was you know as a as a citizen scientist

963
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,519
I'm like what what what's different here

964
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,838
right um and and and then my friend told

965
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:47,039
me oh you know I had this tarp on here

966
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:48,880
and uh over all these wood chips to keep

967
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,440
the wood dry and then they pulled off

968
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,480
the tarp and there it was and so the

969
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,639
tarp was providing this extension of

970
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,440
warmth and then the ground was all

971
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:02,759
soaked with water but the the mushroom

972
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,519
fruiting bodies were not soaked which

973
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,839
can you know often lead to rotting and

974
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:12,000
so uh it was amazing how a tarp

975
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:13,920
unintentionally put on a wood chip pile

976
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,880
actually created this perfect

977
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,400
environment for the extension of their

978
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,920
fruiting phase which which was just

979
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,240
exceptional to see yeah that or

980
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,519
cardboard some people layer with straw

981
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:30,679
anything to kind of give a little bit of

982
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:33,159
a insulative barrier to the extreme

983
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:35,598
temperatures or fluctuations in moisture

984
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:38,519
will help a lot if you don't have a

985
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,599
treed area that is a natural canopy to

986
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,559
kind of protect your patch from the

987
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,680
sunlight in the summer time or the rains

988
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,559
in the wintertime then tarping or

989
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:52,759
cardboard can greatly increase the

990
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,160
success of your patch so you know the

991
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,960
these these mushrooms you know we call

992
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,598
them wood lovers right but but do we

993
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,519
know know why they like wood is there

994
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,599
some I mean clearly there is some

995
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,838
attribute in wood that for example

996
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:07,800
appears in Hardwoods that doesn't appear

997
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:11,480
in soft Woods that they that that these

998
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,640
mushrooms um you know appreciate do we

999
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,920
know what this attribute is which

1000
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:20,239
creates this like symbiosis between um

1001
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,358
these soloe mushrooms and um and

1002
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,799
hardwood

1003
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:27,159
trees you know I've noticed Hardwoods

1004
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:30,880
seem to be a little

1005
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:33,199
uh condu you know they you see a lot of

1006
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,920
different organisms growing on Hardwoods

1007
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,838
compared to conifers look at all the

1008
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:41,119
lyans you know I was just noticing the

1009
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:43,000
other day how many lyan you see all over

1010
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,400
deciduous trees in the Northwest

1011
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
compared to Conifer um like I was saying

1012
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,880
I think there's some kind of a pH acid

1013
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:56,280
kind of thing happening maybe there's

1014
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:58,280
more to it with the the resins and the

1015
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,720
different protective layers that Conifer

1016
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,040
trees have uh compared to the deciduous

1017
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,480
trees but that's a great question I'm

1018
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:08,639
uncertain right on so there's another

1019
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,400
aspect of it um where people so often

1020
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,719
find um you know these mushrooms and

1021
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,240
others like including for where I live

1022
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:19,279
morel's um when when humans get involved

1023
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:21,799
with nature right like like my first

1024
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,240
time ever having a mushroom outcropping

1025
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,318
on my own property fruiting bodies was

1026
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:29,838
when we got a whole bunch of wood Chi

1027
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:32,039
for our garden and and then in in the

1028
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,159
spring it was like boom all these morels

1029
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:36,639
and I you know I felt like like wealthy

1030
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,960
and abundant you know being able to have

1031
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,598
a a five gallon bucket full of full of

1032
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,720
morels I'm all like man this is great um

1033
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,160
but I I think that is also one of the

1034
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:50,358
attributes of wood lovers isn't it where

1035
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:55,118
where if if if humans are are messing

1036
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:58,159
with the wood that that the wood lovers

1037
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,039
are in a symbiotic relationship with it

1038
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:03,838
they're more likely to

1039
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:05,318
fruit yeah like we're I definitely

1040
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:09,599
there's this

1041
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:11,159
crazy thing with cyan Essence where you

1042
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,480
know in the wild there's some kind of

1043
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:15,318
Spore load in the Alder trees but you'll

1044
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,559
never find cyan Essence in an Alder

1045
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:20,920
Grove it it takes humans interaction

1046
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:24,079
taking the Alder chopping it down

1047
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,559
chipping it taking those chips using it

1048
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,960
in landscape and then there's the Spore

1049
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:32,960
load is what a lot of us

1050
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,240
think that is in the bark or in a dead

1051
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,838
area of the bark and then as we chip

1052
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:38,759
we're spreading these spores and then

1053
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:41,279
the melium starts and this is how we're

1054
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,000
finding these cyan Essence in

1055
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,680
landscaping so like I know I'm about to

1056
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,440
ask you to make a you like a little

1057
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,279
conjecture here and I'm I'm comfortable

1058
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,519
with that like you've got a deep Science

1059
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,960
Background but I'm asking for a little

1060
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:55,280
of opinion here like like what do you

1061
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,039
think this tells us about the ecological

1062
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,040
role of wood lovers like it what you

1063
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,079
describe them it it sounds like a job

1064
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:05,759
they're doing right it's like it's like

1065
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,920
it's like it's like oh you know wood

1066
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,440
lovers have got a job to do in nature

1067
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,639
when when trees are damaged or something

1068
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,119
like like you have a lot of experience

1069
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,879
with these these particular types of

1070
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:20,800
mushrooms what is it Vibe like to

1071
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,559
you I I have a strong feeling that the

1072
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,440
genus

1073
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:30,440
solos we have this relationship it's

1074
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,760
this it's it predates our relationship

1075
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,838
with the B Vine the cows you know that's

1076
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,920
the longest relationship we've had with

1077
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:39,318
any other

1078
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,519
organism and there's something there

1079
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:46,000
that we still are missing I you know I'm

1080
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:47,719
uncertain I'm excited by these wonders

1081
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,039
and Mysteries

1082
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:54,919
and you know just understanding all the

1083
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:57,960
different species on the earth is a

1084
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,200
multigeneration task on top of the

1085
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,240
constituents and all the different cool

1086
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:04,078
things about each of those mushrooms and

1087
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,279
what we're going to find it's just it's

1088
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,000
amazing to me yeah one of the things

1089
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,920
that I find interesting about um

1090
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,119
studying wood lovers is um you really

1091
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:17,559
need to have patience um in a way that

1092
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,280
like kind of old school scientists used

1093
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:22,720
to have patience because since um wood

1094
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,839
lovers have not very successfully been

1095
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,558
brought into indoor cultivation you

1096
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:30,039
actually H you know you have to set up

1097
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:31,960
your experiment whatever it might be and

1098
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:33,519
then you have to let the whole season go

1099
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,960
through and then you see what the

1100
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:39,119
mushrooms do it reminds me a lot of how

1101
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,000
um I mean we still do but how people

1102
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,599
primarily used to breed cannabis right

1103
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,920
where um you know you were you were

1104
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,359
doing your cannabis through your full

1105
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,119
cycle and and then when you got your new

1106
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:52,639
seeds then you you know would do that

1107
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:55,440
again the following year Outdoors right

1108
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:58,440
and so you were really only doing um you

1109
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,119
know one one experiment or one breeding

1110
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,318
project a summer because you you were

1111
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,079
doing this in cooperation with with

1112
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:08,119
cycles and then eventually lighting um

1113
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,680
got improved and we brought we brought

1114
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,119
the the cannabis plants indoors and so

1115
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,078
we started being able to do you know

1116
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:16,599
three or four Cycles in a year instead

1117
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,640
of just one and then now we're breeding

1118
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:20,559
with you know spreadsheets and

1119
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:23,039
laboratory and I'm not talking about

1120
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,880
genetic modified particularly just just

1121
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,079
like you know analytically supported

1122
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,280
cannabis where where you can you know

1123
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,760
and you can take these plants and and

1124
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,519
and breed them a lot faster taking that

1125
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,599
example and cross applying it to

1126
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:41,480
mushrooms it's interesting because so

1127
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:44,960
many mushrooms can be can be isolated

1128
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:47,199
and breed so quickly in a home lab but

1129
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,000
the the the wood lovers are going like

1130
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:53,919
no we're we're going to do this outside

1131
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,838
our way only and um uh you know I'm sure

1132
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:00,159
that frustrates a lot of wood loving

1133
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:02,639
scientists um but I I find that

1134
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:05,719
interesting stubborn nature of the wood

1135
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:08,318
lovers to be like kind of a Charming

1136
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:10,798
trait yeah definitely I I like that

1137
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:13,960
analogy with cannabis it you took me to

1138
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:16,199
the Dark Ages there for a second okay

1139
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:21,000
but you're right you're right as

1140
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:23,480
interest and ambition kind of pushes

1141
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,920
technology I think for sure the wood

1142
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,159
lovers are saprotrophic so we know that

1143
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,680
you know we can grow them we can

1144
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,798
cultivate them but they're like the opp

1145
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,679
opportunistic morale like you're saying

1146
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:39,000
that it takes just the right combination

1147
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:42,440
of different seasonality and substrates

1148
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,280
to make that all happen and I'm sure as

1149
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,880
people experiment with different things

1150
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,359
just like Corps you know we weren't

1151
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,079
cultivating Corps uh not too long ago

1152
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,078
and as people experiment with all the

1153
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:56,519
different things that we kind of break

1154
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:59,640
these little codes of cultivation is fun

1155
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:02,039
and exciting so in the wild which is you

1156
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:05,199
know my main interest with these um wood

1157
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:07,318
lovers since um since you know it's fun

1158
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:11,118
to find them they're free when you find

1159
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:12,558
them out there and um and uh it always

1160
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,358
feels like I'm getting away with

1161
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,280
something when I find something out in

1162
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:18,798
nature that we typically pay for right

1163
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,000
it doesn't matter if it's a culinary

1164
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:24,239
mushroom or or you know bringing in

1165
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,639
Nettle outside to make ravioli or

1166
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:27,479
something right I totally feel like

1167
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,920
getting like something from nature for

1168
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,639
free which is pretty dope um are there

1169
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:36,880
any companion plants or other fungi that

1170
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:40,719
we will often find with the wood loving

1171
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:43,838
soloc cybin mushrooms other than um you

1172
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:48,000
know just generally hardwood

1173
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:50,078
trees yeah I you know just the grasses

1174
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,119
and some of the vegetation helps because

1175
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,760
it opens up the Airways and the

1176
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:56,119
substrate you know so if you have some

1177
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,799
plant life

1178
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:01,680
the have root systems that can help in

1179
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:06,119
that I think those can

1180
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:08,000
help um yeah but it's not but it isn't

1181
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,798
as kind of it's not it sounds like it's

1182
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,199
not as specific as like oh this variety

1183
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:16,480
of grass is necessary for the fruiting

1184
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:18,279
cycle of the mushroom like we find that

1185
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,318
in other types of species but there

1186
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,760
really isn't any kind of companion plant

1187
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:25,838
that's that's necessary to the cycle I'm

1188
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,839
I'm hearing yeah not necessary neily I

1189
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:31,838
mean I've I've had Azure Ence grow in

1190
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:34,078
normal grass not sge grass you know so

1191
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:36,318
they I don't think they're particular to

1192
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:39,359
SED grass they just were opportunistic

1193
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:42,279
with what was their in their habitat mhm

1194
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:44,639
so we certainly won't be able to teach

1195
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,119
identification of wood lovers on this

1196
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:50,039
you know in an audio only program today

1197
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:52,559
right um so for for folks who are very

1198
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,519
interested in in the wood for the excuse

1199
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,200
me the wild crafting um you know know

1200
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:01,759
just for the joy of mushroom hunting and

1201
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:05,759
perhaps for the actual taking of of the

1202
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:09,839
natural Bounty um

1203
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:13,480
uh what are the the signs that we would

1204
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:16,960
look for to know when a a Wild Wood

1205
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:19,318
lover is is ready to be harvested um is

1206
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,639
it is it as soon as you can identify it

1207
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:23,480
or is there a certain point where like

1208
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:25,679
if you come across a patch and you

1209
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,559
identify it as for example s Essence

1210
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,639
where you're like like that's what these

1211
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:34,440
are but I need to come back in like 5

1212
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:37,759
days yeah I think you know it's it's for

1213
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:40,519
the newcomer it's easy to just Harvest

1214
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,960
everything you see cuz you're excited

1215
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:44,559
but if you you know if you're in a place

1216
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,920
where you're safe and you want to check

1217
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,720
it out and learn more I I would

1218
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,880
recommend kind of letting things grow

1219
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:54,118
out you know your last question you said

1220
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,200
uh kind of a companion kind of thing

1221
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:59,480
happening I know notice that there are a

1222
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:01,919
lot of galleras the deadly galleras that

1223
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,838
pop up pretty close to a lot of the wood

1224
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,760
lovers here in the Pacific Northwest so

1225
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:12,119
you you do want to pay particular

1226
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:16,040
attention to the patch might not be all

1227
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:18,519
one species of mushroom so there are

1228
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:20,920
easy ways macroscopically to identify

1229
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:23,280
these mushrooms so that you can be safe

1230
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,920
and if nothing else take a spor print

1231
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,599
where you take the stem off the bottom

1232
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:30,400
of the cap and lay your cap skills side

1233
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,838
down on a piece of paper overnight and

1234
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,639
see analyze what the color of the spores

1235
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:38,558
are the next day is a Telltale sign

1236
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:40,639
whether they're poisonous or not so the

1237
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,079
um do you want me to go further on

1238
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:43,759
identifying well I'm actually going to

1239
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,880
take one more step down that same

1240
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,760
pathway which is you know there's lots

1241
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:51,838
of ways to get educated about um you

1242
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,799
know mushroom identification you can you

1243
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:56,119
can join a mushroom group there are

1244
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:58,280
videos online there are certainly some

1245
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:01,599
like really great Cornerstone Books you

1246
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:04,280
know you are not only self-taught but

1247
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,720
you you know you teach this at you know

1248
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,119
the university level you are you know I

1249
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,078
don't know if you are you know

1250
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:12,119
technically a professor but you teach

1251
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:15,200
coursework at the college level right so

1252
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:19,440
you are a professor for as far as I care

1253
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:22,558
um so so so what for people who are new

1254
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,159
to identifying mushrooms um what would

1255
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,798
you recommend as the best way to go

1256
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:29,558
about learning about wood lovers

1257
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:33,480
identification yeah even though I'm

1258
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:35,359
self-taught I have had a lot of friends

1259
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,920
that have given me

1260
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:40,078
firsthand knowledge by going out and

1261
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,760
harvesting I'd recommend joining a

1262
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,798
mological group or even just being

1263
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,640
online the different social media

1264
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,400
platforms where there's groups that can

1265
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:51,558
help identify things taking pictures

1266
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,519
helps out a lot having guide books like

1267
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:56,640
you're saying helps out just whatever

1268
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:59,759
you can do to educate your self both in

1269
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,598
in the library sense in books but also

1270
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,079
firsthand knowledge of going out and

1271
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:06,119
foraging actually touching these

1272
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:08,720
mushrooms cuz it's important um the the

1273
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:11,920
way the stem feels the the smell of the

1274
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:14,199
mushroom even so there's all kinds of

1275
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,599
different characteristics that we can

1276
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:21,239
identify before consuming and taking the

1277
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:22,640
wrong choice right on so so in set three

1278
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:24,358
we're going to set three is going to be

1279
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:27,000
the biggest set and we're going to focus

1280
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:29,358
on know cultivating these Outdoors on

1281
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,440
your own property but but before we go

1282
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:34,400
to the commercial break I think it's

1283
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:37,519
really important to um to talk a little

1284
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:42,358
bit about um mushroom harvesting and the

1285
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:45,318
ecology right so so you know anybody

1286
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:47,838
who's interested in mushrooms wants

1287
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:50,000
mushrooms right but but wanting

1288
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:53,038
mushrooms now you have to remember that

1289
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
there is also o wanting mushrooms later

1290
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,119
and then other people wanting to par

1291
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,318
participate with the mushroom as well

1292
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:02,720
you know what are the ways that we

1293
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:05,960
should Harvest mushrooms when we find

1294
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:08,838
them in the wild which sets up a

1295
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,639
situation where it'll encourage food

1296
00:56:08,838 --> 00:56:14,838
further growth so that you can Wildcraft

1297
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:18,598
them the next season as well there are

1298
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:20,159
different culinary mushrooms uh more so

1299
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:24,280
than the wood

1300
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:26,838
lovers um to be discretionary in the way

1301
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,160
the methods to Harvest a lot of people

1302
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:30,519
that Harvest chantrell will cut them

1303
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:33,279
because there's little primordial

1304
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:36,519
mushrooms behind in the stem area that

1305
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,880
will come back in weeks to come so you

1306
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:41,480
could have more to harvest in the future

1307
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,280
That season a lot of these mushrooms are

1308
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,639
micro risal so you're not going to

1309
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,119
damage them necessarily by pulling them

1310
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:49,798
out of the ground because they're in the

1311
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,599
roots of the trees and the plants but

1312
00:56:49,798 --> 00:56:53,798
there are other types of mushrooms like

1313
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:57,359
the pine mushroom it's also a micro

1314
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:59,920
risal with the pine it's a matataki the

1315
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:02,400
pine mushroom the pine tree and people

1316
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,798
rake around those trees and damage a lot

1317
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,920
of the ecology around the trees by

1318
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:09,318
really raking up because the mushrooms

1319
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:15,639
are found underground generally in the

1320
00:57:09,318 --> 00:57:18,318
the dove so it's generally with um soloe

1321
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:20,960
mushrooms you're not going to have like

1322
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,000
a damaging effect unless people are

1323
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,240
damaging the ecosystem around where the

1324
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,760
mushrooms are you know so TR tread

1325
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:31,919
lightly don't leave your your garbage

1326
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,200
your um your stuff around and um maybe

1327
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,680
leave a few mushrooms for others to see

1328
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:38,960
right on it's nice to know though that

1329
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,838
if we're leaving mushrooms um it is

1330
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,039
because you want to be kind to somebody

1331
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:44,639
that comes behind you and it isn't like

1332
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,480
culinary which is where I got the idea

1333
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,838
from the question where they're always

1334
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:53,719
like you know only um only Harvest a

1335
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:56,199
half to 2/3 because you don't want to

1336
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:57,959
impact the sustainable life force of the

1337
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:00,358
patch as a whole and it sounds like

1338
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,159
that's just not that's just not the way

1339
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:05,798
the the biology works when it comes to

1340
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:08,078
Wood lers no not at all in fact a lot of

1341
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:12,239
times patches are just that season that

1342
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:14,480
are outside uh very rarely do I go year

1343
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:17,959
after year after year and find wood

1344
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:21,318
lovers in the same area unless there

1345
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:24,358
is wood debris or plant debris that's

1346
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:25,358
falling every season to help feed that

1347
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:28,480
area

1348
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:30,358
every year interesting yeah I uh I

1349
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,039
didn't realize why I know that I don't

1350
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:34,038
see them year to year but I wasn't sure

1351
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:35,839
why but it's because they consume all of

1352
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:38,160
the nutrition in that area I'm get I'm

1353
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:40,798
starting to hear and so if you have an

1354
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:44,440
area that you like to Wildcraft you know

1355
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:47,880
be a be a steward and um you know put

1356
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:50,480
put cardboard and or Forest Duff and or

1357
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,599
local leaves there and and and help out

1358
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,280
its

1359
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:57,680
process yeah um sometimes you patches

1360
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,839
just don't work even like you've done

1361
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:03,239
everything you can and no matter what

1362
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:06,960
happens the chips just kind of degrade

1363
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:09,000
and and they move away or you'll have a

1364
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,079
successful patch for one or two seasons

1365
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,760
and you try to give them more food and

1366
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:16,119
something happens and they just die off

1367
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,119
so there is a bit of die off here and

1368
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,280
there but there's also a lot of success

1369
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:21,798
season to season so oh that sounds so

1370
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,559
sad so

1371
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:27,960
sad all right so so um this has all been

1372
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:29,559
a setup for set three though set three

1373
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,480
is probably why you're here dear

1374
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:35,160
listener in set three now that we know

1375
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,358
uh who the wood lovers are and where

1376
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:39,038
they are in the wild set three probably

1377
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:41,318
going to be the longest set is all about

1378
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:43,240
setting up a patch at home so stick with

Instagram one of the reasons why no

1450
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,079
until cannabis growing is so valued by

1451
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:31,240
Farmers is because the mycelium networks

1452
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:33,599
in the soil remain established from year

1453
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:35,519
to year and we know these fungal

1454
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,838
networks are essential because they are

1455
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:40,000
the nutrient super highways that extend

1456
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,558
far and wide in the substrate to feed

1457
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,838
your plants the trouble with growing in

1458

New Living soils or Blended cocoa

1459
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:50,440
substrates is that it takes most of the

1460
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:53,640
plant's life just to create these melium

1461

highways dinico endom micral fungi

inoculant reduces that time and gets

1463
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,559
your plant eating a wider array of

1464
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:02,640
nutrients faster and it's three times

Los and my guest today is myologist

1500
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:34,239
Christian Kalin so here we are in the

1501
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:36,160
big finish and probably for what you are

1502
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:38,439
here for dear listener because we're

1503
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:41,318
going to talk about how to set up one of

1504
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:43,559
these wood lover cultivation Patches at

1505
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:45,599
your house and I got to tell you they

1506
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:48,440
are a lot of fun to put together in

1507
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,440
preparation for this episode um uh I

1508
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:52,760
produced a a few of my own which you'll

1509
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,639
be hearing about in a moment and uh it's

1510
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,039
it is sure a lot of fun fun and I'm

1511
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:59,558
looking forward to seeing um what kind

1512
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:02,599
of fruit they show here in the winter uh

1513
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:04,720
or in this coming fall so so Christian

1514
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:07,000
you know I think right at the top we

1515
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:09,639
should probably hit the legal aspect

1516
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,480
right here uh to get us off the hook and

1517
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:16,038
and that that is that um you know be

1518
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:19,039
aware of what the laws are wherever

1519
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:21,480
you're looking to grow these it is true

1520
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,640
that these are naturally occurring but

1521
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,960
based on where you live you could get in

1522
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:28,400
trouble for intentionally cultivating

1523
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:31,720
them or possessing them or God help us

1524
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,200
selling them and um be really aware of

1525
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:35,000
what's going on because the rules are

1526
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:37,078
changing fast in different you know

1527
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,440
state county municipality all the way

1528
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:41,760
down and you know shaping fire we're an

1529
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,400
international show right and so even

1530
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,400
though you know cultivation of these

1531
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,240
mushrooms may be illegal in much of the

1532
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,720
United States because it's a schedule

1533
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:51,798
one drug um that is not the case

1534
01:05:49,719 --> 01:05:56,078
everywhere where where the shaping fire

1535
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:57,759
audience is so um you know be smart and

1536
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:00,599
uh you know either stay legal or stay

1537
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,520
quiet don't get yourself in trouble and

1538
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:04,278
you know uh be be respectful we don't

1539
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:06,798
want anybody you know you know taking

1540
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:08,838
your property from you or anything so uh

1541
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:11,000
and we're also not making any claims to

1542
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:13,400
what is legal where you happen to live

1543
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,639
so so you know be an adult about it and

1544
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,720
make sure that uh you are clear about

1545
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:20,598
what is legal in your area all right

1546
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:22,399
there we go moving on so so Christian

1547
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:24,680
you know what are the key factors for

1548
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,240
successfully cultivating wood loving

1549
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:27,838
psilocybin mushrooms we're going to

1550
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,318
we're going to talk about details in a

1551
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,318
moment but as somebody who is you know

1552
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:34,880
intimately familiar with it I'm sure

1553
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:37,400
that there are the major pillars that

1554
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,400
any uh you know outdoor cultivation has

1555
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:43,119
to include and what are

1556
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:45,639
those the culture is primary you know

1557
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:48,838
where where you get your base culture

1558
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:51,798
from what species is it what does it

1559
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:54,679
need and do you have the location the

1560
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:57,639
habitat the substrate

1561
01:06:54,679 --> 01:07:00,038
to give it the best opportunity so what

1562
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:02,679
are what is that habitat so let's say

1563
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:05,039
that that um you know a listener is is

1564
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:09,480
looking at their yard and they've got

1565
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:11,520
you know some variety um uh what what

1566
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:13,880
are the questions that I would be asking

1567
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:18,079
myself when deciding what part of the

1568
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:21,480
yard to um to to make my

1569
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,920
planting where where you live determines

1570
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,358
how

1571
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:28,880
much going out of your way you have to

1572
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:30,519
to make your patch successful here in

1573
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,798
the Pacific Northwest or places where

1574
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:35,000
it's humid it doesn't get super hot

1575
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:37,239
these are where they like to thrive

1576
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,519
naturally we are in the best place and

1577
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:43,278
we don't have as many fir walls that we

1578
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:46,519
have to put up so to speak to give them

1579
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:49,798
the best opportunity possible so other

1580
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:53,599
places maybe in the midwest uh Southwest

1581
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:56,239
arid places not very humid you're going

1582
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:59,760
to have to make a lot of different

1583
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:01,719
layers and put it in a nice location

1584
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,520
where it might not get direct sunlight

1585
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:06,679
and go out of your way to give it the

1586
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:09,199
best possible chance so yeah that's kind

1587
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:13,239
of it in the nutshell all right so so so

1588
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:16,000
you've described um shade and and also

1589
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:18,000
you know some amount of moisture so you

1590
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,479
know where we live the moisture is

1591
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,238
everywhere it's in the air it's on the

1592
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:24,198
ground that's easy um but if somebody is

1593
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,158
looking at their property they're first

1594
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:29,079
choice would be shade because they don't

1595
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:31,759
want the area to cook but then second

1596
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:34,039
maybe they are looking at the more damp

1597
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:35,640
part of their property right maybe maybe

1598
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:38,880
the part of their property that's maybe

1599
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:42,319
more Wetlands or maybe has a stream near

1600
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,880
it or or maybe has got a uh you know

1601
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,279
during the winter that's where water

1602
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:48,560
pools these are the kinds of things

1603
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:51,319
right yeah definitely you don't want it

1604
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,880
to get soaked so you don't want it in a

1605
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:55,839
flood zone and you don't want it

1606
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:59,640
necessarily to be

1607
01:08:55,838 --> 01:09:05,000
facing uh the sun all summer so you want

1608
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:07,440
you know to be in a a South sloping

1609
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,960
area you know all these things can make

1610
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,838
a huge difference ultimately how about

1611
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,560
what kind of trees they're under I mean

1612
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:16,719
we know they love the hardwoods should

1613
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,000
we be planting them underneath a

1614
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:22,239
hardwood tree um it definitely sounds

1615
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,319
like we should be avoiding Furs because

1616
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,838
their their root structure

1617
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,199
definitely doesn't provide the

1618
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:30,719
environment we're looking for right you

1619
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:34,479
know it's actually opposite because you

1620
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:36,719
think the deciduous trees don't offer

1621
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:40,079
much protection in the

1622
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:43,960
wintertime and this can be just as kind

1623
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:47,359
of harmful depending on the extreme the

1624
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,359
extremeness of your winter so you would

1625
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,120
think that having it in I mean it's not

1626
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,798
going to hurt to have it in a deciduous

1627
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:55,760
treed area it's just depending on what

1628
01:09:53,798 --> 01:10:00,119
kind of winner you're going to have so

1629
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:02,640
it is kind of nice I I have seen success

1630
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:05,719
around conifers just because they are a

1631
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,480
shade tree basically year round and so

1632
01:10:05,719 --> 01:10:10,039
this can be a very nice place for them

1633
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:12,599
they're you're you're building your

1634
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:14,760
patch on top of the roots so it's not

1635
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,480
like they're going to impede with the

1636
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:20,520
success of the patch because you're

1637
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:24,759
topically on top of the Conifer Roots so

1638
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:26,520
I don't see any problem with that um um

1639
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,560
you know bamboo is another one that

1640
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:31,239
people have used a lot because bamboo

1641
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,640
loses its leaves every year but it's

1642
01:10:31,238 --> 01:10:36,119
also an evergreen so you have shade your

1643
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,280
round plus you have a food source for

1644
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:41,079
your

1645
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:42,759
patch there's uh cardboard and tarps

1646
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:45,119
like we talked about before too if you

1647
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:47,760
just don't have a location with trees or

1648
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:50,800
any kind of shade maybe even a building

1649
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:55,520
on the side of the house can work uh

1650
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:58,920
then using topical methods tarps and

1651
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,480
cardboard and straw will greatly benefit

1652
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,279
so it sounds like we're talking about we

1653
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:05,519
want we want moisture we want shade so

1654
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:08,880
we don't get too much direct sunlight

1655
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,719
and then we want food and so putting it

1656
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,520
somewhere where uh there's going to be

1657
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:17,319
Forest Duff or leaves falling from above

1658
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,800
or um you know uh plants that just drop

1659
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:22,399
lots of like you know sticks or flowers

1660
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,640
or petals or we're looking for anything

1661
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:27,839
that is going to drop on your pile and

1662
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,840
degrade that's a win yes definitely all

1663
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,760
right it doesn't have to be that way but

1664
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,600
that's definitely a plus right on um

1665
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:39,039
good all right so um a lot of folks uh

1666
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,440
me included um you know we start this

1667
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:42,519
we'll be you know we'll be I'll be

1668
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:44,719
asking you to describe this lasagna

1669
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:47,679
technique in a moment but but one of the

1670
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:52,239
main the most important uh input for the

1671
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:54,600
the the lasagna style is the wood chips

1672
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:57,039
um you know

1673
01:11:54,600 --> 01:12:00,679
what what best practices are there for

1674
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:03,359
choosing your wood chips other than it

1675
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:06,679
sounds like them being hardwood the only

1676
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:12,119
one that I for sure came up with was um

1677
01:12:06,679 --> 01:12:15,239
uh being careful grabbing the uh the the

1678
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:17,559
wood ships that come from like the city

1679
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:21,039
parks and things like that because many

1680
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:23,320
cities used pesticides and perhaps there

1681
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:25,039
will be chemicals in those wood chips

1682
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:27,399
but but other than those I'm not sure

1683
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:29,519
what other um best practices there might

1684
01:12:27,399 --> 01:12:32,319
be for choosing wood chips what might

1685
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,719
you have for us that's true if you were

1686
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,479
to Source from arborous you know

1687
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:38,960
depending on where they got their trees

1688
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:42,000
from there could be risk of herbicides

1689
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:44,319
or other things generally when you deal

1690
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,279
with here in the Pacific Northwest we

1691
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:49,279
we're a tree state so there's lots of

1692
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:52,880
wood which is nice uh other places might

1693
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:54,800
not have that but I would say on the

1694
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,159
whole you know if you're getting wood

1695
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,760
chips from an actual chip company then

1696
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:03,879
generally they can be certified organic

1697
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:05,760
actually so there's in the wild you know

1698
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,920
they're just the Alder here in the

1699
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,039
Pacific Northwest is what you'll usually

1700
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:13,158
find and they're a weed tree for the

1701
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:14,279
most part they're everywhere and they're

1702
01:13:13,158 --> 01:13:19,279
they're free of

1703
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:22,759
contamination so um definitely want to

1704
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:24,399
know where the the chips came from but I

1705
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,159
think on the whole you know even if

1706
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:28,599
they're in someone's yard people

1707
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,719
generally aren't spraying their their

1708
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:35,679
hardwood trees it's more like Plants and

1709
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:37,679
Things down below um and then also like

1710
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:40,199
just making sure that the chips haven't

1711
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:42,679
been somewhere where they've soaked up

1712
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:44,799
or they've aged or they were from trees

1713
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:46,399
that were already dead and decaying and

1714
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,840
had all kinds of contamination in them

1715
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:49,960
that would be something you want to

1716
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:54,079
start with nice fresh chips that were

1717
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:56,000
from healthy trees mhm um this may seem

1718
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:57,238
like a laughable question considering

1719
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,800
we're doing this interview in the

1720
01:13:57,238 --> 01:14:01,919
Pacific Northwest but um you know not

1721
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:05,199
everybody has got trees like we've got

1722
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:07,239
and um somebody on Instagram asked me uh

1723
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:09,919
during a discussion whether or not they

1724
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:12,919
could use bagged hardwood chips that

1725
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:15,119
they use for smoking meat so like just

1726
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:16,840
like bagged hardwood chips is there any

1727
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:21,279
reason why that would be

1728
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:23,119
excluded no just the lack of information

1729
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:24,679
maybe of not knowing where they came

1730
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:27,920
from from or how they were handled would

1731
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:29,800
be the only uncertainty but I would say

1732
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,279
any kind of chip basically if you're

1733
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:35,119
willing to just rehydrate it that's all

1734
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:38,399
that needs to happen is just take dry

1735
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:40,359
wood and soak it in a bucket of water

1736
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:43,359
and get it as hydrate as possible before

1737
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:47,599
you inoculate it right on so so let's

1738
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:51,319
talk about um uh uh where to get our our

1739
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:54,239
starting spores or melium now um my

1740
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:55,519
favorite way um my favorite way I sound

1741
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:57,000
like I've been doing this for a long

1742
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,199
time I have been doing this for one

1743
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,119
month right so so in my in that one

1744
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:04,960
month though I've made a I made a few of

1745
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:06,760
these installations and so um but all of

1746
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:10,000
them came from that one patch that I

1747
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:12,920
mentioned earlier that 8 by10 patch um

1748
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,359
because uh my friend was uh selling

1749
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,639
their house and they're all like hey you

1750
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:18,960
know um this is this is this patch is

1751
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:20,440
probably going to get ruined anyway so

1752
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,560
you know feel free to come and collect

1753
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:25,599
my celium and so um you know we went and

1754
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,679
we we scraped the surface and we grabbed

1755
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:31,639
a bunch of mycelium so we had like

1756
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:35,119
really nice rich myceliated wood chips

1757
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:37,119
and degrading and and that's what you

1758
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:38,960
know we used for these patches that that

1759
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:40,519
we've installed in the last month and so

1760
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,158
that's that's a great source so if you

1761
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:46,199
can if you can grab melium from the wild

1762
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:49,158
respectfully there there there's a great

1763
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:51,039
option but but you know I you and I

1764
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:54,000
talking casually you've mentioned many

1765
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:57,399
times um you know getting spores and

1766
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,079
doing the inoculation yourself so so

1767
01:15:57,399 --> 01:16:03,158
maybe talk a little bit about where to

1768
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:06,279
get spores because um even though the

1769
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:08,960
possession of uh these mushrooms are

1770
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:10,519
illegal many places oddly selling of the

1771
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:14,960
spores is

1772
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:17,800
not yeah you you can get spores online I

1773
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:22,319
you know it I I don't

1774
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:25,199
necessarily plug anyone in particular I

1775
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:27,559
I've had Spore syringes where um there

1776
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:29,559
weren't any spores in it so there's it's

1777
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:32,199
kind of funny it's hit and miss it's

1778
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:35,920
kind of the Wild West still as far as

1779
01:16:32,198 --> 01:16:40,519
what you can get out there um definitely

1780
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:45,440
would rather find a wild specimen and

1781
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:47,920
use fresh a a fresh culture fresh melium

1782
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,960
is the easiest basically to get started

1783
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,960
spores you're dealing with a lot of

1784
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,399
different

1785
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:57,359
DNA uh

1786
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:59,879
characteristics and you're you know if

1787
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:04,158
you start spores on cardboard even just

1788
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:05,960
as a low Tech way or um broadcasting the

1789
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:09,559
spores

1790
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:13,880
into uh wet wood debris can also help

1791
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:16,400
but it's it's variable you will get a

1792
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:20,520
couple spores to germinate and then that

1793
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:23,119
melium is very kind of primitive in ways

1794
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,120
it's not necessarily the most aggressive

1795
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:26,960
lines to start from generally when you

1796
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:29,479
start from a Spore you have to put it on

1797
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,920
a petri dish in the laboratory get

1798
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:34,000
really aggressive lines to sequence out

1799
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,000
and it might take three or four or five

1800
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,158
months of transferring from plate to

1801
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:42,399
plate to actually get an aggressive line

1802
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:47,039
that will fruit mushrooms so spores can

1803
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:50,119
be a a legal way um to get to acquire

1804
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:52,479
the culture but then you also you know

1805
01:17:50,119 --> 01:17:54,800
once you Spore once you germinate the

1806
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:56,559
spores and start my selling that is

1807
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,600
considered you

1808
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:04,159
know illegal so it it's one of those

1809
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:07,400
things where um if you can find it in

1810
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:09,039
the wild or you have somebody that has a

1811
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:10,439
little bit of a culture or a patch that

1812
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,439
you can borrow from you can literally

1813
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:16,119
take a piece of someone's patch and

1814
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:19,119
transfer it to your patch and have a

1815
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:22,238
successful patch so you caught me off

1816
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:23,960
guard describing purchased spores uh

1817
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:27,479
taking them into the lab into the Petri

1818
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:30,399
dises to grow them out um uh does that

1819
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:33,879
have to be done or can you just buy wood

1820
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:38,119
loving spores online and and literally

1821
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:40,880
go over to your wood chips and squirt it

1822
01:18:38,119 --> 01:18:43,279
out you know in drops all over your wood

1823
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,400
chips like can you do it that directly

1824
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:48,359
or do you have to grow it out

1825
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:50,679
first you can do it that directly it

1826
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:53,639
it's just variable as far as your

1827
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:55,880
success you're you generally when people

1828
01:18:53,639 --> 01:18:57,679
buy spores they just are hoping to get

1829
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:59,560
one or two mushrooms that then they can

1830
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:02,679
culture and have a fresh mushroom to

1831
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:05,039
culture oh and then from there they can

1832
01:19:02,679 --> 01:19:06,359
have a more direct clone that's more

1833
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:08,920
aggressive that will fruit more

1834
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:11,359
mushrooms in the future so starting from

1835
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,719
spores you're generally not going to get

1836
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:17,439
a very successful Harvest right off the

1837
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:19,319
bat it takes time to get that mycelium

1838
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:22,439
to the point of like a kind of a

1839
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:25,479
commercial Fring strain so when Wild

1840
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:27,799
Harvest your start as I did you're kind

1841
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:31,599
of excuse me you're kind of stuck with

1842
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:34,840
whatever um you have nearby or that you

1843
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:37,280
can borrow from um if you are looking to

1844
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:40,760
have success right off the bat is there

1845
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:42,719
a particular variety of wood lover that

1846
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:45,000
you would recommend someone buy the

1847
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:47,158
spores of just to increase their

1848
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,880
likelihood of success if they're going

1849
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:51,319
to do it the janky way I described where

1850
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,520
you're just going to like squirt the

1851
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:55,479
spores out of the syringe on the pile

1852
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,719
because I know there's a lot of people

1853
01:19:55,479 --> 01:20:00,959
out there like me who who as soon as you

1854
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:03,119
said Petri dishes their eyes rolled you

1855
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,520
know and they're like oh God I'm just

1856
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:05,679
I'm just not that kind of person I'm

1857
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,639
going to buy this thing and I'm going to

1858
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:09,319
go squirt it on my pile and then I'm

1859
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:12,039
going to let it rot and I hope for good

1860
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:15,079
stuff in the fall and so so for all of

1861
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:17,198
those people which include me like like

1862
01:20:15,079 --> 01:20:19,840
like is is there one particular variety

1863
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:22,439
that we that we might want to focus on

1864
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,600
that is more I don't know aggressive

1865
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:25,079
perhaps

1866
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,039
yeah that's a good question I think

1867
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:30,880
Azure Essence are definitely more

1868
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:33,319
technical as far as uh cultivating

1869
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:36,239
they're a little more finicky the cyan

1870
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:40,079
Essence you'll find more frequently out

1871
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:42,238
in public and they are more aggressive

1872
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:44,920
and like different substrates so you'll

1873
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:47,238
probably that I would say my top three

1874
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,760
would probably be

1875
01:20:47,238 --> 01:20:53,638
cyence

1876
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:57,679
ooids and aleni as far as uh the the the

1877
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:59,600
ease of success ovoids tend to fruit

1878
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:02,600
both in the fall and the spring which

1879
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,800
are really cool they technically fruit

1880
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,679
more in the spring than in the fall

1881
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:09,039
which is kind of a cool thing because

1882
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:13,760
most fruit in the fall and then also

1883
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:16,800
I've seen ooids that really just

1884
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:19,199
aggressively consume whatever substrates

1885
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,719
available like they they'll

1886
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:26,359
consume Evergreen and other plant life

1887
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:28,279
and all kinds of different wood so

1888
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:29,759
they're they're a lot more aggressive

1889
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:32,759
they just like give me something to eat

1890
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,920
I don't care what it is let's go yeah so

1891
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:38,239
I you know I would say maybe ooids would

1892
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:41,399
be top top on the list as far as ease

1893
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:43,198
and flexibility in the seasons I like

1894
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:45,719
that idea that you get two flushes a

1895
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:47,479
year too um which leads me to my next

1896
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:48,960
question which is going to be you know

1897
01:21:47,479 --> 01:21:53,238
most of the wood lovers are known for

1898
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,920
being fall um fruiters um is there a

1899
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:56,879
reason why they don't fruit in the

1900
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:59,480
spring as well because you know with

1901
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,400
with many species of plants you you they

1902
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:03,919
they will go through the same experience

1903
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:05,960
in the spring because there's this this

1904
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:09,079
window when the when the temperature's

1905
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:10,960
right and the moisture is right and and

1906
01:22:09,079 --> 01:22:12,840
and then they do their thing and then

1907
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,960
and then in the fall they do it again

1908
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,279
because the moisture is right and the

1909
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,239
the heat is right and so they're like

1910
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:20,238
there's two windows a year but then

1911
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:21,879
there's also lots of fungi and lots of

1912
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:24,079
plants where they're all like no we are

1913
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:26,000
going to going to flower during this one

1914
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:28,359
time of year and that's it so you better

1915
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
pay attention so you can see the flowers

1916
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:32,679
and and so now you just described the

1917
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,119
ooids often have a spring and a fall

1918
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:39,079
flush whereas the cyan essin I'm

1919
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:41,238
gathering um is really just fall and

1920
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:44,439
there isn't a spring one do we know

1921
01:22:41,238 --> 01:22:46,839
about that those mechanics I wish I

1922
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:50,638
that's a great question that would be an

1923
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:53,520
intriguing mystery to solve I I'm not

1924
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:55,920
sure um you know can't even really think

1925
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,719
of it I can't think of anything really

1926
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,719
off the top of my head of why and that

1927
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:03,239
is one of the reasons why it would be so

1928
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:05,880
cool to be back in college and be a

1929
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:07,559
mushroom nerd and suddenly be coming

1930
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,119
into mushrooms because you know when

1931
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:12,600
when you and I were you know in our 20s

1932
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:15,639
back in the day um you know if you had

1933
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,880
this interest um you had to do it like

1934
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:19,639
totally on the down low and you had to

1935
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,279
make sure nobody knew about it and you

1936
01:23:19,639 --> 01:23:23,760
know you'd have your spot in the forest

1937
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:26,119
or whatever and um because it was not

1938
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,679
nearly as acceptable as it is now but

1939
01:23:26,119 --> 01:23:29,639
now you know we've got we've got

1940
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:32,199
universities with cannabis cultivation

1941
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:34,560
programs and and you know everybody and

1942
01:23:32,198 --> 01:23:36,759
their neighbor is into um you know

1943
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:40,400
functional mushrooms for this or that

1944
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:44,600
what a great time to be you know in your

1945
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:46,960
20s or you know or or at at the start of

1946
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,880
a career and being able to go into this

1947
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,520
because there is so much research to be

1948
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,800
done just like the question I asked you

1949
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,520
on so many levels it it is amazing I'm

1950
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,880
so glad that I was able to see it in my

1951
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,800
lifetime I was getting a little worried

1952
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:02,840
there yeah well hopefully it'll all

1953
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:05,639
continue then yeah all right so so the

1954
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:08,880
next thing I want to do is is uh you

1955
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:09,880
know I you you you taught me how to make

1956
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,480
these

1957
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:17,119
installations um from from a wildcrafted

1958
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:18,599
mycelium Source um but instead of me

1959
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:23,359
talking about it I would love you just

1960
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:24,560
to walk us through the steps of making a

1961
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:26,559
what we've just started calling on the

1962
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,639
island a lasagna installation which is a

1963
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,960
little wordy for what it is I guess but

1964
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:32,840
but at least everybody knows what we're

1965
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:35,480
talking about so so so the assumptions I

1966
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:37,360
want you to start with is um we we we

1967
01:24:35,479 --> 01:24:41,599
have identified a place on the part on

1968
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:44,000
the property um that has got some um uh

1969
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,560
tree cover and and yet it's on the edge

1970
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,520
of the of trees and so it it gets

1971
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,400
partial sunlight during the day and that

1972
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:53,199
it's going to be moist most of the

1973
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:54,439
Season except EX for maybe during the

1974
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:56,599
drought part of the Season where you

1975
01:24:54,439 --> 01:25:00,439
might have to water it so so we've got a

1976
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:03,000
decent place and we have identified some

1977
01:25:00,439 --> 01:25:05,198
hardwood chips that we can use so so

1978
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,800
we've got our hardwood chips and we've

1979
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:09,678
got a couple of shovel fulls of

1980
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,960
inoculated mycelium that we found in the

1981
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:16,079
wild please walk us through how to do

1982
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:21,279
the install uh at home okay there there

1983
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:25,198
is a precursor to this patch that can

1984
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:28,599
be very positive in the success of your

1985
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:32,118
future patch a lot of people you know

1986
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:33,440
with cues grows monotub is kind of a

1987
01:25:32,118 --> 01:25:35,359
frequent word that you might hear but

1988
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:37,839
it's basically just a plastic container

1989
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:41,198
that people start their mushrooms in and

1990
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:44,600
Growers that are experimenting with wood

1991
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:47,479
loving varieties are having good success

1992
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:50,800
with starting their melium in a monotub

1993
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:53,439
basically and so you you have your

1994
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:55,639
melium that you've got from a friend's

1995
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:58,039
patch or wherever out in the wild you

1996
01:25:55,639 --> 01:26:00,039
could layer a little piece of cardboard

1997
01:25:58,039 --> 01:26:03,198
down on the bottom of the plastic

1998
01:26:00,039 --> 01:26:05,238
container to kind of be an absorption of

1999
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:07,719
excess moisture as well as like a

2000
01:26:05,238 --> 01:26:10,158
platform for this the culture to really

2001
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:12,399
run through the paper and have a nice

2002
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:15,359
Foundation I find

2003
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:17,799
that as uh mushrooms are used to being

2004
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:20,559
in the ground or inside something and

2005
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:22,840
then growing outwards so to have your

2006
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:25,679
melum at the bottom of your container

2007
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:28,679
and then growing outwards at the top is

2008
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:30,279
seems to be a little more successful and

2009
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:34,560
then like you're saying the lasagna

2010
01:26:30,279 --> 01:26:36,719
layer is just a you know a metaphor for

2011
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,320
creating layers in your container of

2012
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:42,158
different substrates so um with your

2013
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:47,479
melium at the base then you want another

2014
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:50,039
fresh layer of either sawas or um sawas

2015
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:53,158
mixed with wood chips or just wood chips

2016
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:55,479
and then layer more wood chips maybe a

2017
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:57,920
little bit of sawdust if you have it you

2018
01:26:55,479 --> 01:26:59,879
could even use straw if your straw

2019
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,239
doesn't have you know if you can find

2020
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:05,118
organic straw is best it doesn't have

2021
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:07,559
herbicides but you can layer straw in

2022
01:27:05,118 --> 01:27:10,279
with your wood mixture as well to kind

2023
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:13,280
of give it a little different airspace

2024
01:27:10,279 --> 01:27:16,238
so that there's you don't want to create

2025
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:19,559
like a Anor robic condition where it

2026
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:21,718
can't breathe but creating enough food

2027
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:23,800
source that that my stone will just keep

2028
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:26,399
Rising up through your substrate until

2029
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:29,119
it reaches the top and then this is like

2030
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:32,879
your spawn that you can take clumps from

2031
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:36,439
this monot tub of Spawn of substrate and

2032
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:39,560
then use that as a seed or a spawn for

2033
01:27:36,439 --> 01:27:42,158
all the patches that you want to make so

2034
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:45,119
that's kind of a a better way to to

2035
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:47,638
increase your culture before you

2036
01:27:45,118 --> 01:27:49,000
actually get started in your patch if

2037
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:50,719
you didn't want to go through that

2038
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,760
process and you're just excited to start

2039
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:56,039
a patch you basically do the same thing

2040
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,320
just without the plastic container

2041
01:27:56,039 --> 01:28:02,000
outside like you said you found your

2042
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:04,759
your location you might want to uh

2043
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,439
saturate some cardboard in water till

2044
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:10,159
it's completely soaked put your culture

2045
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:12,960
or your melium down on that gives it a

2046
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:14,960
nice platform Foundation to leap off of

2047
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:17,198
and then layer up your chips and your

2048
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,679
sawdust and chips or whatever you have

2049
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:21,439
available and maybe top it off with a

2050
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,800
little bit of cardboard on top to

2051
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:28,198
protect it if if you don't have a lot of

2052
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:29,880
tree cover or uh wet straw basically

2053
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:32,279
when we were doing our installs two

2054
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:34,159
weeks ago from uh from that Source I was

2055
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:36,079
telling you about somebody asked me how

2056
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:38,599
many layers they should put in their

2057
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:41,279
lasagna and I had no idea I was just

2058
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:44,719
doing three layers because that's how

2059
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:47,279
much um mycelium inoculant and cardboard

2060
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:49,359
I had right um but does it does it

2061
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,719
matter whether it's two layers three

2062
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:54,399
layers five layers I mean is there is

2063
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:57,439
there any analysis in that that's a good

2064
01:28:54,399 --> 01:29:00,599
question the more food that you give

2065
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:03,559
your mushroom or your melium the longer

2066
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:05,840
it might take to actually fruit because

2067
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:07,960
we have to remind the viewers that

2068
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:11,079
mushrooms are like the last reproductive

2069
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:13,399
cycle of the melium and it thinks it's

2070
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:16,279
dying so it's creating a mushroom to

2071
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:18,799
create spores to reproduce so we're in

2072
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:22,319
essence trying to give it just enough

2073
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:24,199
food to really grow out make the Mel

2074
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,319
strong and get it to the point where

2075
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:29,759
it's ready to burst and start creating

2076
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:33,198
these little mushrooms so it is a lot of

2077
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:35,159
timing and experimentation in your area

2078
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:37,599
of like your culture how fast it's

2079
01:29:35,158 --> 01:29:40,519
growing through your substrate it might

2080
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:43,719
take a year or two seasons of like

2081
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:46,960
experimenting to see oh I I should have

2082
01:29:43,719 --> 01:29:50,319
you know this season it the spring it

2083
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:52,679
was really cold I got my patch in late

2084
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:55,279
it got really hot in the summer I didn't

2085
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:56,719
water it it dried out you know there's

2086
01:29:55,279 --> 01:30:00,880
there's lots of different variables

2087
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:03,039
season to season but I technically think

2088
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,480
the more the better you might have to

2089
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:07,519
wait longer for your Harvest but the

2090
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:10,839
more substrate and the more layers that

2091
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:12,800
you put in with um a lot of if you can

2092
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:15,360
create your melium first like I was

2093
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:18,880
saying in the little plastic tub then

2094
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:22,399
you you can really inoculate heavily

2095
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:25,480
with melium in a lot of substrat

2096
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:28,479
that then will create a really

2097
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:30,439
aggressive robust patch that will

2098
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:32,759
potentially fruit for a couple seasons

2099
01:30:30,439 --> 01:30:36,039
for you so I'd start bigger than smaller

2100
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:38,159
if you're really serious about like

2101
01:30:36,039 --> 01:30:40,639
trying to get a successful patch going

2102
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:42,679
because it can be it there's so many

2103
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:44,039
variables you yeah totally well that's

2104
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:46,199
why you know kind of you're kind of

2105
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:48,840
giving us like a loose recipe right and

2106
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:51,359
then and then depending on where we live

2107
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:53,679
and what materials we have access to we

2108
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:55,759
kind of apply that recipe like however

2109
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:59,880
we can where we live you know I had

2110
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:03,760
never heard the idea of starting um your

2111
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:05,480
melium in a monot tub Outdoors that is a

2112
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,719
really interesting idea because you're

2113
01:31:05,479 --> 01:31:09,599
kind of uh creating an incubation right

2114
01:31:07,719 --> 01:31:15,079
you're kind or like you know we talk

2115
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:17,560
about um uh uh aerated compost teas a

2116
01:31:15,079 --> 01:31:19,600
lot right so you take your basic uh

2117
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:22,560
oxygen loving microbes and you're

2118
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,920
putting it in your in your uh bubble

2119
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,119
and then you're bubbling it so that you

2120
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,679
make a lot a lot lot more microbes and

2121
01:31:26,118 --> 01:31:29,839
then you and then you put that on your

2122
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,679
plant this is the kind of the same thing

2123
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,719
where we're talking about okay we've got

2124
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:36,118
we've got this you know shovel full of

2125
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:38,359
melium and we we want to make a big

2126
01:31:36,118 --> 01:31:40,519
patch so let's put it in the monot tub

2127
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:43,679
with a whole bunch of um hardwood

2128
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:47,400
sawdust and chips and cardboard and let

2129
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:50,960
it grow through the tub so that when we

2130
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:53,519
go to make the outdoor installation

2131
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:55,960
we're not just just using one shovel

2132
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,280
full we've got you know this this

2133
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:00,600
quarter of a tub full and we're like

2134
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:02,519
hell yeah let's go that's a really great

2135
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,840
idea especially if you only have a

2136
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:08,760
little bit to work with now I want to

2137
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:11,279
ask you how much do you think like when

2138
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:13,079
we say a lot or a little how should

2139
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:15,000
people think about that like how how do

2140
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:17,359
they know how much they have to make

2141
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,479
their installation and let's use let's

2142
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:23,039
use me as an example so from so from

2143
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:26,479
this huge 8 by 10 area we didn't even

2144
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:29,840
take like half of it um but we got five

2145
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:33,559
five gallon buckets full right so that's

2146
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:34,480
I to me that sounds like a ton of you

2147
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:38,000
know

2148
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:40,599
myceliated um mushroom or wood chips for

2149
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,319
us to use and then we we took those five

2150
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,760
and then we split it up between five

2151
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:47,079
locations right and so we used you know

2152
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:50,960
more or less a five gallon bucket along

2153
01:32:47,079 --> 01:32:54,359
with the other cardboard and um hardwood

2154
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:56,840
chips Now using that as the example was

2155
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:59,039
that like you know is is a 5 gallon

2156
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:01,239
bucket like a whole ton where or where

2157
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:05,039
we only need a little bit kind of like

2158
01:33:01,238 --> 01:33:07,599
think it through for us yeah I I would

2159
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:12,639
say a 5 gallon bucket of myceliated

2160
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:14,079
ships would be enough spawn to inoculate

2161
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:16,400
I mean you can stretch it out however

2162
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:19,039
you want but to make a nice successful

2163
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:21,839
patch I think more is better

2164
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:24,639
so amplifying your melium like like you

2165
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:27,319
said in in the Tupperware and then using

2166
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:32,760
like or a 5 gallon bucket and then maybe

2167
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:36,158
a 4T by 4T squared space almost 2 feet

2168
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:39,360
in depth of substrate would be like a 5

2169
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:42,158
gallon bucket of an oculum you could

2170
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:44,519
maybe do like a you could push that to 5

2171
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:47,439
foot by 5T or you know whatever you

2172
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:50,159
think but the depth of the substrate too

2173
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:52,638
is something to consider because um that

2174
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:54,439
melium needs to to get mixed into the

2175
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,359
bottom all nice and thoroughly and then

2176
01:33:54,439 --> 01:33:58,399
you want it all to kind of expand out

2177
01:33:56,359 --> 01:34:02,279
together instead of having a lot of

2178
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:05,439
patches that aren't colonizing and so

2179
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:08,279
yeah I'd say 5 foot x 5 foot for a 5

2180
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:10,759
gallon bucket of my son okay so so if we

2181
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:13,079
have a 5 gallon bucket we know we have

2182
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:15,280
tons of we know we have plenty of

2183
01:34:13,079 --> 01:34:17,800
myceliated wood chips and and we're

2184
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:19,960
clear but but like give us an idea of

2185
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:23,239
what is the the least amount that we

2186
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:25,840
should uh try to start a pile with

2187
01:34:23,238 --> 01:34:29,359
without trying to incubate and make more

2188
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:34,520
in a monotub first like if we only have

2189
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:37,000
a uh you know a a um one shovel full um

2190
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:40,400
is is that just like too precariously

2191
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,719
low amount to like try to make a 3ft x

2192
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:44,679
3ft bed withd and and we should

2193
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,399
definitely go with the monotub first

2194
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:48,719
like like give it give me a threshold

2195
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:51,559
Point how do we know when we have too

2196
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:54,319
little amount to go right to Nature and

2197
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:57,280
we should incubate first oh that's a

2198
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:59,118
great question I you know I always tell

2199
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:01,000
my students to push the boundaries if

2200
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:04,279
you don't have what you need maybe go a

2201
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,439
little bit smaller yeah shovels worth of

2202
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:11,960
really decent melum would probably be

2203
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:15,439
able to do a 3ft by 3T um by 2T little

2204
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:17,719
patch you know um I it just depends on

2205
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:19,479
the culture and how aggressive it is and

2206
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:21,000
all the different variables I can't say

2207
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:22,519
for sure I don't want to promise anybody

2208
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,479
but I would say you'd be on the safe

2209
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:26,239
side to still be able to have a

2210
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:28,439
significant patch just with the shovel

2211
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:30,118
full okay good well that that's a lot

2212
01:35:28,439 --> 01:35:31,960
less than I thought so that's great that

2213
01:35:30,118 --> 01:35:34,238
really opens up uh the door for a lot

2214
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:35,960
more folks because God knows it's you

2215
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:37,479
know a lot easier to find a small patch

2216
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,800
than it is like that big one that I

2217
01:35:37,479 --> 01:35:41,158
stumbled upon right which will be you

2218
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:44,159
know given out to people on the island

2219
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:46,759
for for years to come now um a little

2220
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:49,238
little side point on the monotubs people

2221
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:51,560
actually grow and fruit in the monotubs

2222
01:35:49,238 --> 01:35:54,319
as well so they're creating these these

2223
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,400
little mini habitats within the monot

2224
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:57,679
tub

2225
01:35:55,399 --> 01:36:00,679
actually having maybe a little grass

2226
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:03,840
seat on top producing a little carpet so

2227
01:36:00,679 --> 01:36:06,279
that they have like this ground cover

2228
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:08,000
Essence but it's still all in a monotub

2229
01:36:06,279 --> 01:36:10,679
basically and they're Fring out of the

2230
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,158
monotubs but it is a seasonality thing

2231
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:16,199
outside where you're keeping things

2232
01:36:13,158 --> 01:36:18,198
outside but they're cultivated you'd

2233
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:20,599
have to drill drill holes for drainage

2234
01:36:18,198 --> 01:36:22,799
in the bottom right yep yep that

2235
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:25,320
actually sounds like a of fun like I'm

2236
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:27,520
not I'm not like a big proponent of like

2237
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:30,399
like like let let's add plastic tubs

2238
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:32,760
Outdoors but but it sure sounds like fun

2239
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:35,359
to like to do it with this more more

2240
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:38,880
controlled environment yeah not everyone

2241
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:41,319
has a a backyard or access to a yard or

2242
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,760
they live in could do it in a deck yeah

2243
01:36:41,319 --> 01:36:45,639
yeah yeah totally that's a really good

2244
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:49,800
point yeah thank you for that um a

2245
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:51,679
question about the twoot depth um so

2246
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:54,760
that got my attention because none of

2247
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:57,239
the five we made was 2 ft deep right um

2248
01:36:54,760 --> 01:37:00,679
um each of them they all ended only

2249
01:36:57,238 --> 01:37:04,039
ended up like you know 12 or 13

2250
01:37:00,679 --> 01:37:07,560
in do you know if if they're if if we're

2251
01:37:04,039 --> 01:37:09,920
building this lasagna on bare ground

2252
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:11,440
does the ground count for some of this

2253
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,840
two

2254
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:16,719
feet if the ground is soft and has the

2255
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:18,159
same kind of substrate that the mushroom

2256
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,960
likes then

2257
01:37:18,158 --> 01:37:24,359
yes it's okay that your patches weren't

2258
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:26,158
too deep you're going to need more care

2259
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:28,839
in the long run to make sure that they

2260
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:31,158
don't dry dry out so in the summer

2261
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:33,239
definitely go out there and water uh you

2262
01:37:31,158 --> 01:37:36,960
might want to put a cardboard layer over

2263
01:37:33,238 --> 01:37:39,079
the top in the extreme heat as you water

2264
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,840
your Watering your cardboard that then

2265
01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:45,039
helps create a humid environment for

2266
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:46,840
your patch so the the less depth in your

2267
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:48,519
patch the more care is going to take

2268
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:50,760
throughout the year just to make sure

2269
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:52,440
the extreme temperatures don't that

2270
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:53,800
makes sense yeah that that happens with

2271
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:55,719
aquariums too you know if you have a

2272
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:58,039
little aquarium the environment of the

2273
01:37:55,719 --> 01:37:59,960
aquarium changes really quickly but if

2274
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:02,439
you've got a you know a big 100 200

2275
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:04,118
gallon it really takes a more push to

2276
01:38:02,439 --> 01:38:06,439
change the environment that the fish are

2277
01:38:04,118 --> 01:38:09,238
in kind of the same thing for this patch

2278
01:38:06,439 --> 01:38:13,039
as well um

2279
01:38:09,238 --> 01:38:15,678
so straw straw would be another good uh

2280
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:17,479
al Ally when we're when we're watering

2281
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:19,158
we're not going to be using Municipal

2282
01:38:17,479 --> 01:38:20,919
Water right because it might have

2283
01:38:19,158 --> 01:38:22,960
chlorine or chloramines in it which I'm

2284
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:25,639
guessing

2285
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:28,198
melium and we want

2286
01:38:25,639 --> 01:38:31,279
toture some rain water and use that

2287
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:34,198
right it definitely helps uh chlorine

2288
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:36,920
definitely is

2289
01:38:34,198 --> 01:38:42,000
problematic you're going to get some

2290
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:44,560
growth but it just tends to inhibit yeah

2291
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,279
so if we have if if we don't have if we

2292
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:50,039
don't have access to rainwater and our

2293
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:53,279
city is using um you know you know

2294
01:38:50,039 --> 01:38:55,399
chloride Chlor and maybe fluoride is it

2295
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:57,399
reasonable for us to just pick up some

2296
01:38:55,399 --> 01:38:59,158
uh you know distilled or ar water and

2297
01:38:57,399 --> 01:39:00,479
just use that and we just know know it's

2298
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:04,279
kind of like neutral

2299
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:05,959
water yeah people can leave their normal

2300
01:39:04,279 --> 01:39:08,399
water out in 5 gallon buckets too and

2301
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:10,279
just let the the chlorine evaporate you

2302
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:15,079
know if you leave buckets of water out

2303
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:17,559
for I don't know maybe a week or two um

2304
01:39:15,079 --> 01:39:19,760
then you could use that as a watering

2305
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:23,280
agent too if you don't have access to

2306
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:25,320
clean water that's not ated um we've

2307
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:26,880
already talked about uh you know several

2308
01:39:25,319 --> 01:39:30,079
different issues of things that could go

2309
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:32,719
wrong um is there any other Big

2310
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:35,279
Challenge in growing these wood lovers

2311
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:37,520
that we haven't um addressed for you

2312
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:38,719
know as far as it goes for the patches

2313
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,119
uh something that I should have asked

2314
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:46,079
you about that I haven't

2315
01:39:41,118 --> 01:39:46,079
yet oh good question

2316
01:39:46,118 --> 01:39:50,559
um yeah I mean you're pretty thorough

2317
01:39:48,599 --> 01:39:52,800
Shango well it helps that you taught me

2318
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,000
this just a few weeks ago right so so it

2319
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,639
is it is kind of fresh so all right so

2320
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,158
let's let's talk about the next fun part

2321
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:02,000
which is the the the harvesting so um so

2322
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:05,679
so they're they're they're growing up

2323
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:08,760
and you've got your caps and um you know

2324
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:10,679
generally speaking uh do we want to do

2325
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,560
we want to harvest when the when the

2326
01:40:10,679 --> 01:40:15,319
veils start to break and the and the and

2327
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:18,239
the Caps start to

2328
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:21,319
flatten I like to harvest earlier than

2329
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:22,959
later generally and it's funny the wood

2330
01:40:21,319 --> 01:40:25,559
lovers a lot of times they cluster

2331
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:28,118
together so tight that it's hard to not

2332
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:30,719
just pull up huge clusters together so

2333
01:40:28,118 --> 01:40:33,079
you'll you'll have some kind of immature

2334
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:35,319
ones and some mature ones but you

2335
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:37,079
generally will just start harvesting the

2336
01:40:35,319 --> 01:40:38,439
patch all at once you know if your patch

2337
01:40:37,079 --> 01:40:40,279
is big enough you might it might take

2338
01:40:38,439 --> 01:40:42,519
you a couple days or something you can

2339
01:40:40,279 --> 01:40:44,719
just kind of start taking the more

2340
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:47,199
mature mushrooms and as you're working

2341
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:50,560
through it they just keep maturing but I

2342
01:40:47,198 --> 01:40:51,678
like more uh younger specimens so the

2343
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,800
caps

2344
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:56,560
don't just uh break apart into nothing

2345
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,159
and you can have these nice beautiful

2346
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:01,239
mushrooms but I'm into the aesthetic

2347
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:02,479
look of them as well so I don't know

2348
01:41:01,238 --> 01:41:04,039
they look really cool together when

2349
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:07,439
there's lots of different stages of

2350
01:41:04,039 --> 01:41:12,840
growth together um it's it's I mean it's

2351
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:14,238
cute yeah um uh but you can wait um wait

2352
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,119
for them to flatten out some people

2353
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:17,759
think that you know they might get a

2354
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:20,639
little more weight from that or

2355
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:23,360
something but I I I feel like it you

2356
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:25,880
know if anything you might be degrading

2357
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:28,719
the content the potency of your fruit

2358
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:32,239
bodies by waiting longer um I know that

2359
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:35,239
some mushroom varieties once the veil is

2360
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:37,519
ripped and it starts to drop spores this

2361
01:41:35,238 --> 01:41:40,519
sporulation gives a signal to the

2362
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:42,719
substrate to stop fruiting are wood

2363
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:45,199
lovers one of those variety of mushrooms

2364
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:47,118
where we you know we really want to keep

2365
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:50,279
it from dropping too many of the spores

2366
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:53,039
cuz it's working against us no not that

2367
01:41:50,279 --> 01:41:56,118
I know of um that patch just it'll just

2368
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:58,760
keep keep going you'll you'll have um

2369
01:41:56,118 --> 01:42:01,559
some contamination from spores sometimes

2370
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:06,079
where you know that it just creates kind

2371
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:08,440
of a dirtiness that will you know it it

2372
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:10,639
degrades the mushroom caps when they

2373
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:12,919
have large spores from another mushroom

2374
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:14,359
cap on top of that cap kind of thing and

2375
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,560
then it can degrade the mushrooms

2376
01:42:14,359 --> 01:42:18,799
quicker yeah I've gotten that in my

2377
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:20,360
monotubs and it's like a it makes them

2378
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,079
very unattractive looking they still

2379
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:26,880
work it's just very unattractive looking

2380
01:42:23,079 --> 01:42:29,639
yeah um for wood lovers do you recommend

2381
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:32,118
um harvesting uh for example with like

2382
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:34,159
you know a razor blade around the bottom

2383
01:42:32,118 --> 01:42:37,000
where you're leaving the base in the

2384
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:38,960
soil or are we good to just like pop

2385
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,560
them out and take some of the soil with

2386
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,880
us and then just clean them up in the

2387
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:45,560
house that's what I generally do the

2388
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:49,520
ladder uh and then you can save those

2389
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:52,080
little stem pieces the little roots and

2390
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:55,480
Transplant those and and create more

2391
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:58,039
myum or give them to friends or whatever

2392
01:42:55,479 --> 01:43:00,879
so some people will wash the roots off

2393
01:42:58,039 --> 01:43:05,039
you know the stems and try to salvage as

2394
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:08,159
much as possible you know Maria Sabina

2395
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:10,599
um back in the day said you know don't

2396
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:14,799
cut the feet off cuz the little saints

2397
01:43:10,599 --> 01:43:16,639
those feet are important too so good so

2398
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:18,639
so so go you know if we're going to pull

2399
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:20,039
them up go ahead and cut off the feet

2400
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:21,199
and and clean them up if you're going to

2401
01:43:20,039 --> 01:43:23,238
do that for

2402
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:26,238
but then take the feet and reintroduce

2403
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:28,319
them to your pile um and you know giving

2404
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:30,718
giving back to your pile and and being

2405
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:32,799
as efficient about it as you can yeah

2406
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:35,399
we're starting those little monotubs and

2407
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:38,599
creating more melium right on so now so

2408
01:43:35,399 --> 01:43:40,559
let's say now you've got um you know a

2409
01:43:38,599 --> 01:43:42,800
couple of paper plates or whatever full

2410
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,280
of mushrooms how do you recommend going

2411
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:47,039
about uh drying them and obviously we're

2412
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:48,158
talking about in a non-commercial

2413
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:50,118
application here right we're just

2414
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:51,399
talking about somebody's house so how do

2415
01:43:50,118 --> 01:43:55,639
you recommend that they go about drying

2416
01:43:51,399 --> 01:43:58,638
them out just your typical dehydrators

2417
01:43:55,639 --> 01:44:01,920
that you can buy online or at stores uh

2418
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:04,039
they can just be a simple little

2419
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,560
electrical heat element in the bottom

2420
01:44:04,039 --> 01:44:09,198
and then they have the rack trays they

2421
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,320
can be round or Square sometimes people

2422
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:16,359
will just make a

2423
01:44:11,319 --> 01:44:19,359
mini at home de de hydrator by you know

2424
01:44:16,359 --> 01:44:21,118
creating a little box with a fan and

2425
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:24,439
room temperature if you're house is

2426
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:26,198
around 68 70° with a little fan that can

2427
01:44:24,439 --> 01:44:27,559
be enough in a little container to dry

2428
01:44:26,198 --> 01:44:31,399
out mushrooms as long as they're on a

2429
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:34,119
screen or something that it allows

2430
01:44:31,399 --> 01:44:37,399
breathability right on I I done both of

2431
01:44:34,118 --> 01:44:39,719
those yeah yeah I I I don't suggest

2432
01:44:37,399 --> 01:44:41,799
using the oven much cuz ovens have too

2433
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:45,840
high of a low setting to really you know

2434
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:48,480
it tends to kind of get too hot heat

2435
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:50,840
heat can be damaging to the potency of

2436
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:54,439
psilocybon so yeah we want to evap at

2437
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:56,679
them not cook them yeah exactly yeah so

2438
01:44:54,439 --> 01:44:58,598
so now that they are dried um how do you

2439
01:44:56,679 --> 01:45:00,560
recommend the storage of these mushrooms

2440
01:44:58,599 --> 01:45:03,159
and like I know that storage could be a

2441
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:04,760
you know a third of a show and of itself

2442
01:45:03,158 --> 01:45:06,960
but but considering we're to this part

2443
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:09,280
and it's just for personal you know use

2444
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:12,118
how would you store these so they last

2445
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:15,679
longest the there's differing research

2446
01:45:12,118 --> 01:45:17,679
out there that says that

2447
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:19,480
potency is

2448
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:24,480
maintained

2449
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:27,158
through like 50° and you know limited

2450
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:28,799
humidity at room temperature you're not

2451
01:45:27,158 --> 01:45:31,279
going to have any kind of degradation in

2452
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:34,360
the potency and then there's also kind

2453
01:45:31,279 --> 01:45:37,880
of a side that says like freezing fruit

2454
01:45:34,359 --> 01:45:39,439
bodies could also be long-term storage

2455
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,679
but then there's also a little bit of

2456
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:43,519
information out there saying that

2457
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:45,560
freezing actually degrades cybin so

2458
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,760
there's a lot of differing opinions and

2459
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:51,280
information out there right now as far

2460
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:53,560
as um storing long-term in room

2461
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:57,238
temperature freezing but I think both

2462
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:59,400
I've had good results in both uh at room

2463
01:45:57,238 --> 01:46:01,638
temperature if you're not sealed up

2464
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:04,279
completely and you were growing outside

2465
01:46:01,639 --> 01:46:08,159
there is chance of fly

2466
01:46:04,279 --> 01:46:10,679
larvae uh germinating so freezing can

2467
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:13,118
technically keep that from happening so

2468
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:17,158
your your mushrooms would last longer in

2469
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:21,158
a dried Frozen environment rather than

2470
01:46:17,158 --> 01:46:23,519
um taking a risk with fly larv

2471
01:46:21,158 --> 01:46:26,158
eggs in the future so I haven't run into

2472
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,599
that I hope I don't yeah I mean that's

2473
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:30,920
common in the culinary world with Morel

2474
01:46:28,599 --> 01:46:35,159
and pinis where people will have a

2475
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:36,560
beautiful mason jar of morel or pinis

2476
01:46:35,158 --> 01:46:38,000
and they come back a couple months later

2477
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,119
and it's just powder because

2478
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,920
everything's germinated so uh freezer

2479
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:47,039
will not allow that so one thing I will

2480
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:49,639
add that I have I have added to my uh

2481
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:53,599
best practices that I really like is um

2482
01:46:49,639 --> 01:46:57,760
they they set sell these um vacuum seal

2483
01:46:53,599 --> 01:46:59,520
devices for largemouth mason jars and so

2484
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:01,480
you can you can put whatever you know

2485
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,560
cannabis or mushrooms into your mason

2486
01:47:01,479 --> 01:47:06,959
jar and then you put the the Mason jar

2487
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,400
lid on but then you put this device over

2488
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:11,399
the top and you push a button and it

2489
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:14,399
sucks out all of the the oxygen from the

2490
01:47:11,399 --> 01:47:18,079
jar and then it seals the flat part of

2491
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:21,198
the two-piece lid to the jar because um

2492
01:47:18,079 --> 01:47:25,399
you know the the the things that destroy

2493
01:47:21,198 --> 01:47:28,799
these mushrooms are um you know not only

2494
01:47:25,399 --> 01:47:31,638
uh heat and and bright light but also

2495
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:35,639
oxidation and so if you if you you know

2496
01:47:31,639 --> 01:47:38,599
Jam your mushrooms into a jar and then

2497
01:47:35,639 --> 01:47:41,359
and then remove the oxygen so there's a

2498
01:47:38,599 --> 01:47:42,920
there's a small ratio within the jar

2499
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:44,479
meaning that your your jar is packed you

2500
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:46,319
don't have a small amount of mushrooms

2501
01:47:44,479 --> 01:47:48,678
to a big jar and then and then you

2502
01:47:46,319 --> 01:47:49,960
vacuum out all of the air um and then

2503
01:47:48,679 --> 01:47:52,000
you know just throw it underneath your

2504
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:53,760
bed you know you're in a dark place

2505
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,599
that's you know more or less temperature

2506
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:58,760
stable and now you're in a non oxy

2507
01:47:56,599 --> 01:48:01,400
oxygenated environment you should be

2508
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:04,039
good until your your next round of

2509
01:48:01,399 --> 01:48:06,319
fruiting the next fall I like that

2510
01:48:04,039 --> 01:48:07,599
that's great I I didn't mention freeze

2511
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:09,840
drying either it's a little more

2512
01:48:07,599 --> 01:48:11,719
expensive but they do make the desktops

2513
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:14,360
that are a little more affordable for

2514
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:16,880
the homeowner and freeze drying is

2515
01:48:14,359 --> 01:48:19,598
pretty amazing too I don't know what the

2516
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:22,000
research is as far as potency levels but

2517
01:48:19,599 --> 01:48:23,800
the texture and just what the mushroom

2518
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,679
looks like after it's freeze-dried is

2519
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:28,039
just amazing it looks like it's fresh

2520
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:30,599
basically yeah it it is actually really

2521
01:48:28,039 --> 01:48:33,279
remarkable how how it doesn't um you

2522
01:48:30,599 --> 01:48:36,000
know it doesn't do the shrivel thing so

2523
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:37,920
um all right Christian so so um we're

2524
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,520
going into the wrapup here but I I want

2525
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,639
to give you a chance to kind of wax

2526
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:44,560
philosophical because um I have heard

2527
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:46,480
you do that before and and I have liked

2528
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,320
it um and also you're you know you're

2529
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:50,678
pretty because you are still very much

2530
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:52,880
in the mixed both you know at you know

2531
01:48:50,679 --> 01:48:55,199
with the academic part and the science

2532
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,000
part and also the entrepreneur part you

2533
01:48:55,198 --> 01:49:00,039
know your your your thumb is definitely

2534
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:02,560
in the mushroom Pie as it were so so

2535
01:49:00,039 --> 01:49:05,840
wrapping up what future research

2536
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:08,520
directions do you find most promising um

2537
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:10,960
for understanding or utilizing these

2538
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:14,520
wood loving soloc cybin mushrooms I mean

2539
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:17,880
right now we focus on their their beauty

2540
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:19,880
and their ability to heal but like we're

2541
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:23,079
just we're just at the beginning of our

2542
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:24,800
Rel relationship um with this mushroom

2543
01:49:23,079 --> 01:49:28,359
since we're we've started learning the

2544
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:30,199
actual science of it so so what excites

2545
01:49:28,359 --> 01:49:32,399
you looking into the future of wood

2546
01:49:30,198 --> 01:49:35,559
lovers and our relationship to

2547
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:38,319
them yeah that's a deep question um we

2548
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:41,080
didn't touch much on wood lover

2549
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:42,439
paralysis and I think probably because I

2550
01:49:41,079 --> 01:49:44,840
don't even know what that is I didn't

2551
01:49:42,439 --> 01:49:46,879
even know to ask you so what so go ahead

2552
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:48,679
and address that if you'd like well

2553
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:53,079
that's kind of been my little mission of

2554
01:49:48,679 --> 01:49:55,880
late because Oregon is Banning the use

2555
01:49:53,079 --> 01:49:59,118
of wood lovers for

2556
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:05,239
mental and you know for whatever reason

2557
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:07,399
in their new legislation for legalizing

2558
01:50:05,238 --> 01:50:09,799
basically everything but they're not

2559
01:50:07,399 --> 01:50:12,960
going to allow wood lovers because of a

2560
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:16,279
wood paralysis that happens in people

2561
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:20,560
it's very does does it happen yeah I I

2562
01:50:16,279 --> 01:50:23,800
would say it does but it's it's I I'm a

2563
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:26,199
little uncertain about what it really is

2564
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:28,599
and I think everyone else kind of is

2565
01:50:26,198 --> 01:50:31,919
there there's no

2566
01:50:28,599 --> 01:50:36,760
real understanding as of yet there's

2567
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:40,599
just kind of uh people's opinions and

2568
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:43,280
experiences and some people just feel

2569
01:50:40,599 --> 01:50:45,599
like within an hour of eating a lot of

2570
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:47,000
times they're fresh fresh mushrooms and

2571
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:50,279
a lot of times they've been in New

2572
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:53,719
Zealand and Australia with the sub orosa

2573
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:56,319
uh which I think is uh you know a super

2574
01:50:53,719 --> 01:50:59,000
potent mushroom and that might be part

2575
01:50:56,319 --> 01:51:00,679
of why there is paralysis because you

2576
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,639
know anyone that's taken a large amount

2577
01:51:00,679 --> 01:51:03,920
of mushrooms can feel paralyzed

2578
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,039
throughout their

2579
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:09,960
experience whether it's like this

2580
01:51:06,039 --> 01:51:10,880
physicalness or this um in in your mind

2581
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:16,158
in your

2582
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:18,400
Consciousness so it I'm I I I'm

2583
01:51:16,158 --> 01:51:21,198
interested to know more

2584
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:24,799
about if there is the

2585
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:26,319
physiological paralytic response in

2586
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:30,679
people

2587
01:51:26,319 --> 01:51:34,078
and but more so I I just

2588
01:51:30,679 --> 01:51:36,800
think psilocybin and sosin in general

2589
01:51:34,078 --> 01:51:40,359
and all these different

2590
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:42,320
precursors and pro drugs that's that's

2591
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:43,679
my interest in the future I've always

2592
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:48,118
been intrigued with the different

2593
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:51,399
varieties of coces and why each one has

2594
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:55,359
its own kind of characteris istics as

2595
01:51:51,399 --> 01:51:59,319
you ingest them um ovoids they grow in

2596
01:51:55,359 --> 01:52:02,000
the spring and they have just this nice

2597
01:51:59,319 --> 01:52:05,679
uplifting energetic light-heartedness to

2598
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:09,000
them playful almost as if you know as a

2599
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:12,199
spring like mushroom would give you um

2600
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:15,920
the Azure Essence is just knock your

2601
01:52:12,198 --> 01:52:19,359
socks off melt melt your face off go uh

2602
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:21,480

2603
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:24,319
and and come back to find out who you

01:52:21,479 --> 01:52:28,198
really are you know

2605
01:52:24,319 --> 01:52:30,599
there's so much um within this genus to

2606
01:52:28,198 --> 01:52:35,118
offer and there's we've delayed the

2607
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:37,560
research for way too long and there's so

2608
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:40,719
much that we're doing to our world and

2609
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:44,800
to ourselves and so much

2610
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:48,319
unrest that I just I feel like this is

2611
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:51,360
kind of The Last Hope and ways for us to

2612
01:52:48,319 --> 01:52:54,238
get together and

2613
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:56,118
understand why we're here and who we are

2614
01:52:54,238 --> 01:52:58,959
and how

2615
01:52:56,118 --> 01:53:02,399
to like group together to be like

2616
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:06,359
mushrooms to work symbiotically

2617
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:08,479
to get rid of the things that don't

2618
01:53:06,359 --> 01:53:11,920
serve us

2619
01:53:08,479 --> 01:53:16,598
and um understand the true meanings of

2620
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:19,399
things so um yeah that's you got me

2621
01:53:16,599 --> 01:53:20,920
going deep there yeah well it I you know

2622
01:53:19,399 --> 01:53:22,799
you been friends for a while I know it

2623
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:26,520
doesn't take much

2624
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:30,520
so well um well I I mean this molecule

2625
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:32,920
does this like um this this there's this

2626
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:35,079
is a bigger thing you know this it's

2627
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:37,760

that makes you feel good like there's

2629

there's a lot more to it and I hope that

2630
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:47,158
more and more people that are scared of

2631
01:53:42,599 --> 01:53:49,239
it or that are tentative that um they

2632
01:53:47,158 --> 01:53:52,439
would come to the Forefront too um

2633
01:53:49,238 --> 01:53:55,839
legisl ERS and people that need this

2634
01:53:52,439 --> 01:53:59,118
that can make a difference um there

2635
01:53:55,840 --> 01:54:00,760
