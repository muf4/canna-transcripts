2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,638
patients always want exact answers I

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,619
know when I go to the doctor I too want

4
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:15,539
specific answers to specific questions

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,939
and I rarely get them

6
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,399
similarly when cannabis patients ask me

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,160
detailed questions often the answers are

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,778
also elusive the best medicine is

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,640
individualized medicine and by

10
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,660
definition

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,179
individualized medicine is going to be

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,340
somewhat unique to every person that

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,960
said when it comes to cannabis if you

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,600
identify the proper blend of

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,058
cannabinoids and start Slow and Low in

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,800
the dosage a path to resolving the issue

17
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,679
usually presents itself

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,419
cannabis is safe for nearly everyone and

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,399
humans have had thousands of years to

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,200
get into relationship with the plant and

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,460
learn it to be reliable and with few

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,460
side effects

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,500
however when you add complex chemical

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,600
Pharmaceuticals to the mix sometimes

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,100
things don't go as planned and most

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,840
Pharmaceuticals have only been around

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,359
for a mere fraction of the time that

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,640
cannabis has been used by humans and

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,439
also while a layperson can easily

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,019
understand the dosing Dynamics for

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,298
cannabis that is entirely untrue for

32
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,340
most Pharmaceuticals whose contents are

33
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,900
intentionally obscured and instructions

34
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,299
for use are shrouded in Legally

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,240
defendable double talk it is enough to

36
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,220
frustrate anyone just trying to get well

37
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,478

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,680
and pharmaceutical interaction and give

115
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,719
you a road map for doing this research

you care for during the second set we

will review red flag Pharmaceuticals and

119
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,319
Drug families that present especially

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,720
high risk and how the availability of

121
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,060
new cannabinoids and concentrates has

122
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,680
exacerbated these issues and in the

123
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,418
third set we look at the differences

124
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,180
between endocannabinoid and

125
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,439
phytocannabinoid drug interaction

interaction research and we encourage

back on episode 29 and that seems like

139
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,680
such a long time ago in fact it was the

140
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:06,899
week of Christmas in 2017.

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,800

the before times you know

143
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,120
so much as it seems like that seems like

144
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,319
a lifetime ago for so many things and

145
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,040
projects

146
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,860
um

147
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,180
that's amazing yeah for sure so um and

148
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,800
that was in the early days of shaping

149
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,600
fire when we focused a bit more on

150
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,879
business so

151
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,340
um episode 29 is a great one about

152
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,079
canvas product manufacturing uh

153
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,839
standards and we don't cover the license

154
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,519
Market as much anymore but um folks if

155
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,619
you're if you are in licensed cannabis

156
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,659
or in in you know in medical cannabis

157
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,579
and in production that's a really

158
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,160
excellent show that has remained

159
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,779
Evergreen over the years so so I

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,660
encourage you to go back and and check

161
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,698
out episode 29 if you haven't uh let's

162
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,620
say uh you know the big update to that

163
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,939
though is I've gone from

164
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,560
you know voluntary certification

165
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,300
assessments for Regulatory Compliance on

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,860
all types of cannabis operations around

167
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,819
the world and since then I actually got

168
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,460
to visit hemp facilities in China Europe

169
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,259
and I've started to work with state

170
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,299
governments on

171
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,979
you know determining compliance

172
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,560
assessment criteria and updating

173
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:19,258
regulations you know driven by science

174
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,399
from that experience so you know I feel

175
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,560
like you're you're like the

176
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,138
paleontologist Shango you got to walk

177
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,560
with uh you know a dinosaur like me in

178
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,939
the early days that's that's I guess

179
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,399
that's one way to put it except you're

180
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,360
you're still so young though so I hope

181
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,560
so because I think you're younger than

182
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,600
me so

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,939
um so so but but today we're here to

184
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,819
talk to talk and focus on the interplay

185
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:44,399
between cannabis and the Pharmaceuticals

186
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,660
that cannabis patients may be taking and

187
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,459
we both want to be clear right off the

188
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,460
bat that we are not giving you medical

189
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,978
advice today we have no way of knowing

190
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:55,318
your actual whole situation and our goal

191
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:58,019
today is to flesh out some of the

192
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,000
intricacies of this topic and and help

193
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,099
you gain some perspective so you can

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,740
figure out effective individualized

195
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,780
medicine for yourself or the people that

196
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,600
you care for so so all right let's get

197
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,978
right into it so jaehan the idea that

198
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,900
anyone and of so many phytocannabinoids

199
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:18,120
interacting with any one of thousands of

200
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,279
prescription drugs that they could have

201
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,098
an unintended side effect seems like a

202
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,899
pretty realistic thing nowadays but for

203
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:27,000
years in the medical cannabis community

204
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:29,279
no one wanted to admit that it was

205
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,779
possible including me and and maybe it

206
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,359
was simply because there were so little

207
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:35,459
research into it or and we just hadn't

208
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,800
seen it but also it could also just be

209
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,079
that we're all really protective of our

210
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,939
favorite plant cannabis but now we know

211
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,939
that these interactions actually do

212
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:47,038
exist as as more and more people use

213
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,800
cannabis and we're able to collect more

214
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,959
data are we actually seeing more reports

215
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,240
of interactions nowadays

216
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,839
yeah

217
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,360
um the potential for drug drug

218
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,818
interactions regardless of the substance

219
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,620
you know cannabis has compounds that

220
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,620
interact with receptors and are

221
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,360
metabolized by our body l-set wouldn't

222
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,478
have all these you know Wonderful

223
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,460
therapeutic benefits that we hear about

224
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,079
um but but drug drug interactions or

225
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,839
ddis are

226
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,359
are increasing generally across the

227
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,659
board not just for cannabinoids or

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,300
cannabis but it is the primary cause of

229
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,939
adverse drug reactions and it's it's

230
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,399
something that creates over half a

231
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,139
billion dollars of estimated burden on

232
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,860
our health care System annually and

233
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:40,259
there's a lot of efforts to avoid these

234
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,120
drug drug interactions

235
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,519
um you know drug relegatory agencies

236
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,339
like the FDA usually mandate this sort

237
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,399
of thing and we know a lot about them

238
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:52,740
for some stuff for like Marinol which

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,240
was approved you know a decade or so

240
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,339
before we knew there were cannabinoid

241
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,600
receptors as well as for epidiolex or

242
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:02,399
CBD so these have been explored but what

243
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,100
we're dealing with now is you know we

244
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,360
live in a really lucky time and in a

245
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,500
really lucky place if you're listening

246
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,659
to this in the United States we have the

247
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,580
FDA and I know that people like to

248
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,019
criticize the FDA well that's that's

249
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,160
great that's that's one of the great

250
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,019
things about being alive you get to

251
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,139
criticize things but it's also the best

252
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:22,620
drug regulatory agency in fact it's so

253
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:25,139
good that most of us simply throw away

254
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,778
the insert on any medication we get it's

255
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:29,399
like as this long fold-out map of

256
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:32,519
potential issues we're like up just

257
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,980
throw that away this is FDA approved so

258
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,019
we do live in a time where we buy a loaf

259
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,600
of bread we buy a bottle of aspirin we

260
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:42,720
get our prescription medications and we

261
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,060
just assume that if it's on a shelf it's

262
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
safe and and the risks

263
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:49,439
um you know are known or they wouldn't

264
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,399
or it wouldn't be on a shelf however you

265
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,500
know there's

266
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,839
interesting things are happening with

267
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,559
cannabis compounds you know due to a

268
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,959
strong patient and consumer demand

269
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:03,359
cannabis based products don't follow the

270
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,699
traditional standard drug development

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,159
pipeline that we hold pharmaceutical

272
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,100
drugs like you know antidepressants or

273
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,838
other drugs too they just you know you

274
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,320
package and label them at the state

275
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,959
level and so there is a lack of

276
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,980
understanding or appreciation of the

277
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,379
potential

278
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,860
drug drug interactions

279
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:28,559
um and again a lot of these occur from

280
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,500
you know oral administration of multiple

281
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,299
substances sort of the more drugs that

282
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,419
you use the more pharmaceutical drugs

283
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:41,338
the more medicines you take the higher

284
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:43,319
your chances of interactions and

285
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,060
you know this is not you know we have to

286
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,620
kind of like you know I've been a

287
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:49,139
passionate advocate of

288
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,899
product safety particularly for medical

289
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:54,360
cannabis patients for for almost two

290
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,399
decades and you know I remember a time

291
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,919
when the plant products weren't even

292
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,139
tested before giving to people who had

293
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,620
compromised immune systems

294
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:07,259
um I remember arguing with uh operators

295
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,519
to put voluntarily put expiration dates

296
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,919
and people saying thing like well

297
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,919
cookies don't go bad

298
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:16,379
um and but again we we see drug drug

299
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,958
interactions all the time we talk about

300
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,059
them all the time but we don't know that

301
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,119
we're talking about them some of them

302
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,939
are for our benefit and some of them can

303
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,259
increase risk

304
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,140
let me give you an example of a

305
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:34,019
conversation I had 15 years ago maybe 20

306
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:36,480
years ago I was just a just a little

307
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:39,539
researcher at the time an undergraduate

308
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,459
and I approached a cannabis operation

309
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,500
started talking them up about CBD you

310
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,299
should carry CBD products this is like

311
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,860
going to be a great thing and people

312
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:48,599
that started small circles to talk about

313
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,659
and they asked me what it did and I said

314
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,180
oh well it it actually blocks the

315
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:56,159
intoxicating effects of THC and they're

316
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:59,219
like oh my God that sounds terrible

317
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,500
nobody will ever want that but CBD and

318
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,660
THC is a form of a drug drug interaction

319
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:09,360
it's not quite what we're talking about

320
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:11,759
but it can be one that may not be ideal

321
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,079
um for some people uh you know so I

322
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,659
think that when we talk about drug drug

323
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,578
interactions we talk about them we talk

324
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,919
about oh this variety of cannabis has

325
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:23,039
this mixture of compounds it's good for

326
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,199
this it helps with this it it's has

327
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,899
these indications

328
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,240
um there's an array that can be present

329
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,278
um so I think we always have to keep in

330
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,320
mind that we are familiar with this we

331
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:37,078
talk about it you know it's like saying

332
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,360
I like to talk about you know baseball

333
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,458
statistics but I don't like math well

334
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,100
clearly you do like math because you're

335
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:46,078
analyzing averages and percentages so we

336
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,540
we do have the fundamentals of this I

337
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,159
think in the industry so we're not

338
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:53,219
really talking about I think anything

339
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,679
new today that you that you probably

340
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,139
haven't you know discussed before how do

341
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,479
drugs interact together to produce an

342
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,278
effect and let's talk about that how a

343
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,680
little bit because the different

344
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,958
mechanisms I think it's important for

345
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:09,419
people to wrap their heads around the

346
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,719
the first interaction that I I was aware

347
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:15,360
of was years ago learning that CBD can

348
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,639
increase the potency of some seizure

349
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,459
medications meaning that the seizure

350
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,680
patients taking CBD could sometimes take

351
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:25,199
less of that seizure medication and get

352
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:28,138
the same effect in some cases let's

353
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,600
dissect that idea because the CBD could

354
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:33,180
be causing the seizure medication to be

355
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,639
more potent for many reasons one being

356
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:38,099
perhaps at the CBD and the seizure

357
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,860
medication are doing the same thing and

358
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,399
working side by side instead of actually

359
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,259
on each other or secondly CBD could be

360
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,899
acting in a way that the seizure

361
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,778
medication has gets more resources or

362
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,278
something there's a lot of different

363
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:56,700
mechanisms for why that could be

364
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:59,399
happening and um you know I know that

365
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,680
you have studied in detail these

366
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,958
different mechanisms of drug drug

367
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,239
interaction I'd really appreciate if you

368
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,919
would tease them apart and explain a few

369
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,778
of them and like take your time give us

370
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,139
give us like three or force that we can

371
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:15,600
really grok the different mechanisms

372
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:17,820
you know absolutely and when we talk

373
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,480
about mechanisms

374
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,639
um

375
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,339
you know we can I like to think about

376
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,419
them in three ways

377
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:29,880
one is cannabinoids as victim right

378
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:32,458
where the mechanism is that the levels

379
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:34,980
of the cannabinoid is changed you take a

380
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:37,559
drug and it makes the you take you you

381
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,659
take it with THC let's call it drug X

382
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,119
right and you take it with a THC product

383
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:45,419
and suddenly you're feeling way more

384
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,339
sedated or have way higher Munchies side

385
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,198
effect or whatever pick your side effect

386
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,820
for your conceptual example and it's

387
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,039
just it's increased because the

388
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,899
cannabinoid levels are changed by

389
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,179
another drug so cannabinoid is a victim

390
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,198
where its levels in your body are

391
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:00,539
changed

392
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:03,479
well cannabinoids can also be

393
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:06,778
perpetrators they can cause changes in

394
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,220
the levels of another drug

395
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:10,198
um and so in this case you know they

396
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,240
might be increasing or decreasing the

397
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,379
amount of like you said like

398
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,079
anti-epileptic medication or a pain

399
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:18,299
medication and if this information is

400
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:22,620
well understood you're absolutely right

401
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:24,778
it can be leveraged to improve uh Health

402
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,839
Care outcomes you know if you're like oh

403
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:29,338
there's a drug drug interaction between

404
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,980
cannabinoids and opioids you can take

405
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,260
less opioids and get the same effect wow

406
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,420
we thank goodness we knew about those

407
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:39,539
interactions so that we could take steps

408
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:42,360
to make that a benefit instead of an

409
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,740
increased risk now there also are so

410
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,860
we've talked about cannabinoids as

411
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,680
victims cannabinoids as perpetrators and

412
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,360
there are also pharmacodynamic effects I

413
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,439
think that's the first five syllable

414
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,220
word we've used so far but there are

415
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,980
pharmacodynamic effects and what this

416
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,720
means is that both drugs have

417
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:04,680
overlapping effects and our concepts of

418
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,959
victim and perpetrator don't apply here

419
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:10,319
but you know one thing is like if we

420
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,778
take a research on THC and Baclofen

421
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,120
individually at doses given to people

422
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,939
and studies is a little bit of sedation

423
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,639
not too much to write home about but you

424
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,440
put them together there's like sedation

425
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,000
coming from that drug sedation came from

426
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,060
the other drug and put it together

427
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
sedation plus sedation equals a lot of

428
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:33,259
sedation and that could be an unwanted

429
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,539
side effect and adverse effect

430
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,980
and so as we continue with this victim

431
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,198
in perpetratory analogy you know you

432
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,120
mentioned

433
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,379
cannabidiol CBD I think this is a great

434
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,360
example because

435
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:48,899
you know here we have

436
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,139
a drug that is given to Pediatric

437
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,120
patients in large amounts who are also

438
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,039
taking other medications

439
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,659
and in the

440
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,939
you know

441
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:02,278
I think even several years ago starting

442
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,779
I think divinsky published the paper in

443
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,759
2018 and

444
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:08,160
those of you listening can email me

445
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,660
message me on social media if anything I

446
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,000
mention you're like I want that study

447
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,220
send me that link feel free to reach out

448
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,099
but you know they should have high doses

449
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,558
of CBD significantly increased levels of

450
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,298
narclobism

451
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,918
which is an active metabolite of Clovis

452
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:24,720
and so basically what you're saying is

453
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,419
you have a baseline amount let's call

454
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,039
the Baseline zero it's just or normal

455
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:33,840
right

456
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:36,899
um and so when you take it with CBD

457
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,240
um you can start to see that uh the

458
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,340
amounts of clobazam and the ratio of

459
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,240
clobazam 10 or clobazam the metabolite

460
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:47,339
and the the the parent compound just go

461
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,220
a little Haywire you start to see those

462
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:54,538
levels change if almost completely

463
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:57,779
different than without CBD we're talking

464
00:17:54,538 --> 00:18:02,900
um you know the the we're seeing you

465
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:06,480
know 150 200 350 percent above Baseline

466
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,880
those uh you know those bars on the

467
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,240
graph look like skyscrapers of New York

468
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,640
City which is a signal that we need to

469
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,380
pay more attention to and that would be

470
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,500
an example of a cannabinoid as a

471
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,799
perpetrator of a drug drug interaction

472
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,798
um and so how is this happening you

473
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,259
might be saying well we have a lot of

474
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,519
things in our bodies that like to handle

475
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:33,240
drugs

476
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:35,579
um you know we're we're hardwired to uh

477
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,519
consume things have them hit little

478
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:40,980
proteins also known as receptors

479
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,319
throughout our body and send along

480
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,000
little messages

481
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,399
well however we have to have a system

482
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,500
that gets rid of the drugs after they've

483
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,798
sort of sent their message to the brain

484
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,220
to the body and had their effect and we

485
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,379
have these drug metabolizing enzymes

486
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,179
what do they do well they are the

487
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,400
garbage trucks of drugs they just like

488
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:05,340
they like chewing up drugs and helping

489
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,320
us pee them out so the enzymes are

490
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:11,339
responsible for this so when I say

491
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:14,038
enzymes I say proteins I say receptors

492
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:17,639
these are all things that our body makes

493
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:20,038
from our DNA right we have we have DNA

494
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,960
that codes amino acids that form these

495
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,859
proteins the proteins can do a lot of

496
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:30,000
different things and these sip

497
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:33,418
uh cyp 450 we call them sips for short

498
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,660
for short for cytochrome p450 there are

499
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:39,620
many different forms and

500
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,620
um you know there are

501
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,640
um you know we inherit different ones

502
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,058
from our family and I think this next

503
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,280
point is important because with the

504
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:54,960
Advent of Gene testing you can find out

505
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:59,460
some information about how you might uh

506
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,519
metabolize drugs so there are people who

507
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,558
are slow metabolizers like really poor

508
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,298
that means a drug stick around is longer

509
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,720
there are people that are intermediate

510
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:11,460
metabolizers there's people who are

511
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,100
extensive and then there are people who

512
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,558
are Ultra rapid

513
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,899
and that means that if you're an ultra

514
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:22,500
rapid metabolizer you can take a drug

515
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:24,419
and you may not even feel or you may

516
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,599
feel just the faintest of effects for it

517
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,538
before it's metabolized and excreted

518
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,538
from your body

519
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:34,919
there are some really wild examples of

520
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:37,919
this

521
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:41,400
um you know for example

522
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,559
um there is an association with um

523
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,100
because people who suffer from a

524
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:49,500
genetically from sickle cell disease

525
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:51,899
they have some genes in majority of the

526
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,480
population that are conserved and many

527
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,759
of them are Ultra rapid metabolizers of

528
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,279
opioids and frequently people with

529
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:02,700
sickle cell disease get prescribed the

530
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:05,399
maximal allowed amount of opioids which

531
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,480
has been steadily decreasing over time

532
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,460
but they tend to be ultra rapid

533
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,819
metabolizers so whereas most average

534
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,679
people would probably fall on the

535
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:20,220
intermediate in the mid-range of drug

536
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,660
metabolizing and a little opioid goes a

537
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,880
long way there are populations that

538
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,740
would rapidly just and wouldn't feel an

539
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,840
effect so it would look really weird on

540
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,819
someone's chart had a doctor like wow

541
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,619
you're taking a lot of opioids but

542
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:33,599
unless you knew the genetic component

543
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,459
and the other drugs they were taking it

544
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,178
may not make a lot of sense

545
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:43,140
so one is uh to know thyself right and

546
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:45,659
so using kind of all available tools to

547
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,419
understand first of all from a baseline

548
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:51,720
how do I what how do I even metabolize

549
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:53,400
drugs am I the type of person who can

550
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,919
drink coffee all day long and go to

551
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,900
sleep because I'm a rapid metabolizer or

552
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,880
well just smelling a cup of coffee keep

553
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,759
me up for three days like these might be

554
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,200
things you can playfully tease out and

555
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,019
so the reason I want to mention that

556
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,240
because that is a factor

557
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:11,779
um with this stuff because there are

558
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,200
people who have mutations

559
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:18,720
polymorphisms uh a single little change

560
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,259
can cause people to be you know much

561
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,120
more uh say you know it can change the

562
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:27,599
amount of THC that's even in their body

563
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:30,859
so if you are a slow metabolizer of THC

564
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:33,119
you'll have more THC floating around

565
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:35,038
and much like someone floating around

566
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,099
with nothing to do they might get into

567
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,200
trouble and so that it increases the the

568
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:42,178
chances of a drug drug interaction so

569
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,240
you could you could have be a slow

570
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:47,220
metabolizer and realize that you know I

571
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,279
have to be careful about the timing and

572
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,558
method of ingestion because this is

573
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,359
going to stick around for longer than

574
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,579
the average person

575
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,279
so you could get you know depending on

576
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,439
how well you metabolize things you could

577
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:05,038
have three-fold higher levels floating

578
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,380
around which I have to say uh if you do

579
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,658
are a rapid or Ultra rapid metabolizer

580
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,720
you'll probably have a better chance of

581
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:15,840
passing a blood test if you were ever

582
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,700
pulled over for a cannabis related DUI

583
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,500
you just better hope and pray you're a

584
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,080
rapid metabolizer if it's based on

585
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,179
thresholds for the amount in your system

586
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,798
just to give you an example of some real

587
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:30,900
world implications for this information

588
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:32,879
powerful information is available for

589
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,159
you to navigate this I think is is the

590
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,179
point I'm making and so we talked about

591
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:41,700
CBD on clobazam and how that's an

592
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:45,000
interaction where CBD is inhibiting a

593
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:48,600
sip that prevents the metabolism of this

594
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,159
class of benzodiazepine not not a fun

595
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:53,038
time

596
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,080
um and so

597
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,940
you know we have these sips these

598
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,240
enzymes there's a whole bunch of them

599
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,400
and they do different things and they

600
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,659
metabolize different drugs and when we

601
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,559
think about

602
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:09,840
you know cannabinoids as victims there's

603
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:14,579
uh different sips and they have fun

604
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:16,019
little names like sip 3a4 or sip 2c9 and

605
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,879
and you're probably wondering those are

606
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,619
so beautiful I'm so glad scientists

607
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,240
named them that way because it's totally

608
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,918
easy to understand what they do it's not

609
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,079
like you know

610
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:31,940
um so sip 3a4 can be inhibited they can

611
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:34,500
be activated by different drugs and so

612
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,240
Clarithromycin ketocals all there's

613
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,119
other protease Inhibitors that people

614
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,819
take and when you take those drugs

615
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,918
you're you're inhibiting some sips they

616
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:46,379
like to block those proteins for some

617
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,538
reason and if you take a cannabinoid you

618
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:52,020
could have two to four times the amount

619
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:55,019
of THC or CBD in your bloodstream in

620
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:57,480
your plasma relative to just you know

621
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:59,099
taking the cannabinoid alone and that's

622
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,079
again these could be

623
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:03,538
drugs that have nothing to do with each

624
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,119
other like Clarithromycin or again

625
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:08,000
ketocalzal

626
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,979
and that's a paper I think published in

627
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,038
2013 you know 10 years ago they

628
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,038
identified this reaction and so what we

629
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,900
see is that you have these drug

630
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:22,798
metabolizing enzymes that can be either

631
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,440
in can be largely inhibited by a drug

632
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:30,298
that then affects another drug so

633
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:33,080
THC needs sip3a4 to be metabolized and

634
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:37,440
processed by the body you inhibit that

635
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:40,259
it stays around longer which could have

636
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,980
unintended consequences but again it all

637
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:46,259
comes down to how we use the information

638
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,419
as well and so I think that there's

639
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:51,419
again

640
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:53,820
um you know a lot of this information is

641
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,100
extrapolated from drug metabolism

642
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:57,480
studies like there's not there's not a

643
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,699
lot of clinical work where people are

644
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,880
like we want to study

645
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,880
drug drug interactions there's it's all

646
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,919
sort of teased out from studies and so a

647
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,299
lot of this stuff has been put together

648
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,960
from almost like detective like work

649
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:15,900
um

650
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,419
and again you know there are some

651
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,100
clinically significant ones and you know

652
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:24,380
CBD

653
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:26,579
um you know with clobazam Warfarin

654
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,020
tachromyas and

655
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:31,379
methadone

656
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,460
have all been implicated in having a

657
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,919
potential significant drug drug

658
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:38,100
interaction but I'll say that there the

659
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:42,059
Nuance there is that it also depends a

660
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:43,980
little bit on your genetic makeup and a

661
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,879
couple of other factors but again on

662
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,860
paper

663
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,400
these things have a clinically

664
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:53,099
significant interaction potentially and

665
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,000
THC does share some of those similar

666
00:26:53,099 --> 00:27:00,418
concerns with uh you know TV CBD and THC

667
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,839
both represent an issue with Warfarin

668
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,419
potentially as well I I um think that

669
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,240
we're seeing now exactly how complex

670
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:11,400
this has become because I think for most

671
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,519
of us we're just kind of thinking in

672
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,820
this singular way that that cannabinoids

673
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,980
are interacting with Pharmaceuticals and

674
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,439
generally we think of it as having a a

675
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,000
bad effect however you know we're

676
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,220
getting a better idea now that we can

677
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,200
have cannabis acting on the

678
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,360
pharmaceutical and then we can have the

679
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,759
pharmaceutical perhaps acting on the

680
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,519
Cannabis and they can also be going in

681
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:37,440
the different directions they can be

682
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,558
inhibited one could be inhibiting the

683
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,019
other or they could also have additive

684
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,359
effects so now that's going in two

685
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,740
directions and then and then and then

686
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,839
there's another two directions because

687
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,720
the additive or in effects could

688
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,579
actually end up being desirous or they

689
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,220
could be something that we don't want

690
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,980
and so suddenly now we see this like

691
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,038
multi-dimensional

692
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:05,460
um uh you know interplay between these

693
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:07,558
drug drug interactions and like our

694
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,840
definitions kind of start to float away

695
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:12,240
because because some of the interactions

696
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,038
for one patient are going to be negative

697
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,839
and but for a different patient they're

698
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:17,220
going to be desirous and I think that

699
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,759
you've done a really good job at

700
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:24,000
illustrating how how we we need to look

701
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:26,579
at you know individual patients and not

702
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,679
make big grandiose rules that we're

703
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:31,798
going to try to apply to everybody all

704
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,778
drugs or all types of patients and uh

705
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,000
and I like this encouragement for us to

706
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:38,038
you know dig into our genetics as well

707
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,440
you know especially if we're trying to

708
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:43,379
tease out some kind of drug drug

709
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,740
interaction problem we think we have

710
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,980
um uh and and we want to get uh specific

711
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:52,500
with that I also like this idea of this

712
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,259
perpetrator and victim idea where where

713
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,720
you know you've got you've got one

714
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:00,419
compound that is receiving the action

715
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,860
and the other one that is is placing the

716
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:04,020
action

717
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:06,240
um let's talk a little bit about the

718
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,099
cannabinoids that are already in our

719
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,079
body right so like up till now we've

720
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:11,278
been talking about adding

721
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:12,658
phytocannabinoids so cannabinoids from

722
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,058
Plants

723
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:17,460
um to the mix but we know that we

724
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:19,319
already have endogenous cannabinoids in

725
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,740
our body they already exist and and

726
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:23,639
usually when we are taking additional

727
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,859
phytocannabinoids from the cannabis

728
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,500
plant to supplement the endocannabinoids

729
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,418
that our body creates

730
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,619
um you know that's that's our goal I'm

731
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:36,179
curious

732
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:38,359
um do we see any uh or or significant

733
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:40,320
interactions between these

734
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,298
endocannabinoids that somebody who

735
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:46,678
doesn't even use cannabis will have in

736
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:48,058
them and these Pharmaceuticals

737
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,778
sure

738
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:54,960
um you know we certainly can talk about

739
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:57,179
some of the things that will make you

740
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,140
realize you have an endocannabinoid

741
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,000
system

742
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,919
so when we talk about the

743
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,140
endocannabinoid system it's it's again

744
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:09,480
it's not just anandamide and 2ag and pea

745
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,600
and oea and all the amino acid

746
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,940
conjugated endocannabinoids and you know

747
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,158
the we could definitely delve into the

748
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,320
molecular Psychiatry of all those

749
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,360
compounds but

750
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,480
we have to remember that a lot of these

751
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,939
endocannabinoids are made on demand and

752
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,259
they are

753
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,880
metabolized quickly and reason that's

754
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,579
important is because

755
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,860
you know we we want to focus on

756
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:35,699
anandamine 2he but we also have to focus

757
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,759
on

758
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,740
them being made we can't just look at

759
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:44,158
the bullet we have to look at the gun

760
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,359
that's firing the bullet and in this

761
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,100
sense

762
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,918
um the analogy isn't perfect but when we

763
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,558
think about PHA which is the as in you

764
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,200
know I like to think far out research

765
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:57,658
research but a PHA is an enzyme that

766
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,120
you know choose up the endocannabinoids

767
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:03,059
so uh it's it's the you know the

768
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:06,119
endocannabinoid dump truck they are made

769
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:08,639
quickly by our body on demand again most

770
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:11,278
signaling molecules are made and stored

771
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,820
and released uh endocannabinoids are

772
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:17,038
made on demand and so one interaction

773
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:20,398
with the endocannabinoid system I think

774
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:22,319
most people have experienced I will

775
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,778
describe in a moment there's actually an

776
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,879
over-the-counter medication that anyone

777
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:28,980
can buy that will interact with your

778
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,360
endocannabinoid system and I'm going to

779
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,360
let you think about it for a minute

780
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,219
listener and Shango but I just want to

781
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,398
tell you about this case report real

782
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,700
quick and so imagine

783
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:43,619
you uh had a history of painless

784
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,480
injuries in your life you accidentally

785
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:47,219
cut your finger and everyone's like oh

786
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,620
my gosh did that hurt and you're like ah

787
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,679
it's all right stub your toe don't feel

788
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:56,038
it morphine opioids don't really relieve

789
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,679
your pain you get some minor surgery uh

790
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,058
from experiencing life and you know

791
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,240
you're like I don't need pain medication

792
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:05,519
and you know you people around you and

793
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,740
even use like wow I have this high

794
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,898
threshold for pain

795
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,538
so how could the endocannabinoid system

796
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:14,759
explain well I'm not really getting an

797
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:16,859
effect from opioids I actually don't

798
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:18,480
even need them

799
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,418
and that's

800
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,538
um and this is from a story that was

801
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:27,538
laid out in a case report about a a

802
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:30,839
micro deletion in the DNA and it was in

803
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:33,058
a PHA Gene the gene that tells our

804
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:35,519
bodies how to make this enzyme that

805
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:38,038
breaks down the endocannabinoids and

806
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,740
that without the dump truck the trash

807
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:45,000
just piles up and so you get a lot of

808
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:47,579
Ananda mod and you know decreases in

809
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,519
pain sensitivity and so this actually

810
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:53,939
really happened the mutant walks Among

811
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,679
Us it was a 66 year old female had a

812
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,440
history of not requiring any pain

813
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,159
medication a history of painless

814
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,440
injuries wow and and why why do I say

815
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,179
why does this relate to an

816
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,960
over-the-counter endocannabinoid drug

817
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:11,820
well it's a little tongue-in-cheek but

818
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,220
paracetamol or as some of us call it

819
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:16,259
Tylenol right

820
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:21,200
requires thought to exert its pain

821
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:23,759
relieving properties and so a uh

822
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,620
basically Alex macrianos who's at

823
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:28,200
Northeastern University was an advisor

824
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:30,239
on my thesis and was also you know many

825
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,538
of my colleagues like Dr Josh Hartzell

826
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,278
and others worked with him as well and

827
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:41,460
he discovered

828
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:44,759
um a a drug and it turns out that it's

829
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:48,538
um it's related to this but basically

830
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:51,179
um without when you take Tylenol it is

831
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:52,740
metabolized into a fat inhibitor which

832
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:55,080
temporarily

833
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,460
increases the amount of endocannabinoids

834
00:33:55,079 --> 00:34:00,240
in your system

835
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:02,460
and so if you uh created what they did

836
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,278
an experimental model a permanent fall

837
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,360
inhibitor drug which irreversibly binds

838
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,239
fall

839
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:12,539
you know pressed wall or Tylenol had no

840
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,479
effect so no endocannabinoid system no

841
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:18,300
Tylenol and this is again this is a fun

842
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,659
example an extreme example for us to

843
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,940
play with these Concepts like wow

844
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,619
um I'm taking Tylenol how does it work

845
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,039
one of the ways it works is by

846
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:31,079
inhibiting this enzyme that allows my

847
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:33,418
endocannabinoids to flourish be produced

848
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,819
in higher than normal concentrations it

849
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:37,739
does other things as well and

850
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,260
um and so I think like there's one

851
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:41,699
example of

852
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,619
endocannabinoid interaction and and so

853
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:45,178
the next time you go to a grocery store

854
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,159
you know look there's there's an

855
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,480
endocannabinoid medicine right there on

856
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,280
the Shelf

857
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,079
um but obviously you know the

858
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,960
endocannabinoids are slightly different

859
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,500
in their activity than THC and CBD they

860
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,838
share a lot of interactions

861
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,139
um and I think there are other things we

862
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:04,739
can think about you know cannabinoids

863
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:08,879
obviously interact with the

864
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:09,659
endocannabinoid system and I think one

865
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,680
of

866
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:15,000
the ways that we can think about it

867
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:18,000
is it

868
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,519
um you know cannabinoids can

869
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,338
you know inhibit or enhance certain

870
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,719
activities of each other and so you know

871
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:26,059
if we have

872
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,239
you know

873
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:31,858
CBD in there and it's modulating

874
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:34,259
cannabinoid receptors to make them more

875
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:35,639
difficult to be activated It's actually

876
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,920
an

877
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:41,279
um a negative allosteric modulator of

878
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,440
CB1 you know what does that do to your

879
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,099
natural anandamide signaling right so

880
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,420
CBD can definitely influence that and I

881
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:51,420
think we can

882
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,220
think about other aspects there as well

883
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,260
it's you know I wish I had like a

884
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:58,559
virtual whiteboard to start drawing out

885
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:01,920
circles and charts but let me try to sum

886
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,659
it up real quick so you know CBD

887
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,400
is a great one to talk about because it

888
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:09,000
does a lot of a lot of things it's a

889
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,099
very promiscuous molecule but it it

890
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,619
increases anandamide levels because CBD

891
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,720
does have a little bit of Pho inhibitor

892
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,660
activity so it increases anandamide

893
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:22,679
levels that stimulates a bunch of other

894
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:24,980
channels and receptors like trip V1 if

895
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:28,199
you're vaneloid receptors trip V1

896
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:31,500
something you you stimulate every day if

897
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:34,500
you eat spicy food it's a capsaicin from

898
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,320
Chili Peppers stimulates it and so you

899
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,139
know you could take uh you know CBD

900
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,700
increases anandamide levels or you're an

901
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:44,460
or if you just subnaturally high in

902
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:49,139
animal levels this will counteract or

903
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:52,800
antagonize the effect of potentially of

904
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:55,199
um of CB1 receptors on glutamatergic

905
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,079
neurons and so you can

906
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:00,659
um you know one thing that THC does is

907
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,920
it slows brain activity a little bit and

908
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:04,078
what I mean by brain activities doesn't

909
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,119
like make your brain dead but it's one

910
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,160
of the reasons it has a benefit right is

911
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,320
that people talk about cytotoxicity

912
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,358
excessively active neurons if you have a

913
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,400
seizure or traumatic injury your neurons

914
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:15,719
might be firing like crazy and firing

915
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,579
until they kill themselves just like

916
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:20,338
release release really stimulus stimulus

917
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,920
stimuli you know Red Alert Red Alert

918
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,239
um and uh you can decrease that

919
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,880
signaling that's why one of the reasons

920
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,739
it makes it hard to remember stuff

921
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,619
um but it also makes it you know makes

922
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:34,500
it harder to receive a pain signal so so

923
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:37,260
what happens is uh just simply put THC

924
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,539
hits a receptor decreases in glutamate

925
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,700
release

926
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:43,858
however uh you can also enhance

927
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:45,659
glutamate release by stimulating trip

928
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:48,719
receptors and so you could have this

929
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:50,578
sort of give and take these forces going

930
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,319
in different directions

931
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:55,260
um to impact it so I know that was a

932
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,300
little bit of a heady response

933
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,920
um you know but I mean there's lots of

934
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,480
examples

935
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,460
um like this like

936
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,099
um that's probably the one we need for

937
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,599
now though

938
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:09,240
because you're right it is it is

939
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,099
incredibly complex and we're certainly

940
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:13,858
not going to be able to explain them all

941
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:16,440
but um in in one episode but you made

942
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:19,078
the point very clearly that we need to

943
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,820
not go into this with assumptions that a

944
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:23,820
we know what's going to happen base

945
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:26,579
based on science that might be outmoded

946
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,440
and that individuals and the you know

947
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,300
really show the importance of

948
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,358
individualized medicine and that

949
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:35,640
cannabis can do that and then also in a

950
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,759
way we're kind of like already swimming

951
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:41,400
in all of these drug compounds that that

952
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,260
you know we're taking from Over the or

953
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,180
over-the-counter drugs plus any

954
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,579
Pharmaceuticals that were being offered

955
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:50,039
plus you know you add to it maybe some

956
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:52,980
cannabinoids and and you know maybe

957
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:54,960
somebody is also micro dosing mushrooms

958
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,380
and and suddenly now there's this like

959
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,440
the this soup of of different drug drug

960
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,320
interactions going on and and there's no

961
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,960
surprise that that there would be some

962
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,880
some sometimes unexpected effects and

963
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,980
before you jump on X I can almost feel

964
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,838
you going for it we need to take our

965
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,300
first short break we'll be right back

966
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:16,980
you are listening to shaping fire and my

967
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,099
guest today is molecular pharmacologist

968
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,059
jeon Marco PhD

969
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,500
oh

970
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,000
[Music]

971
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,559
you've heard me talk about the

972
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,480
award-winning cannabis seeds that come

973
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:29,338
from the analytical breeding program of

974
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,519
Seth and Eric Crawford who founded

975
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:35,099
Oregon CBD seeds in fact Seth was a

976
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,980
guest on shaping fire in 2020 to talk

977
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:40,559
about triploid genetics Seth and Eric

978
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,960
are now releasing high THC seeds for

979
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:46,980
home Growers and Farms as grow the

980
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,920
revolution seeds at GTR seeds.com

981
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:52,559
their high THC seeds are extraordinary

982
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,900
in that they will start to flower at 16

983
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,880
and a half hours of daylight instead of

984
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:00,000
the typical 14 and a half hours of

985
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,980
daylight that means in most regions your

986
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,260
plants will start to flower outdoors in

987
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,838
the middle of July instead of the middle

988
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,000
of August which means these photo period

989
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,519
plants finish in September and not

990
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,260
October totally upending the photo

991
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,599
period Seed Market

992
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,420
Seth and Eric took their prized early

993
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,700
flowering CBG line and bred it to some

994
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,400
of the most desired verified genetics

big name and hype breeders fighting to

discover a breeder who is breeding

1025
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:39,899
because it is the only thing they care

1026
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,339
to do and they would be doing it even if

1027
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,039
they never made a dime

1028
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:46,320
that's my friend Craig hartsaw who makes

1029
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:48,300
seeds as magnetic genetics

1030
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,920
Craig comes from five generations of

1031
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,960
farmers and is earning his master's

1032
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,119
degree in Horticulture right now he's

1033
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,800
been growing cannabis for 15 years and

1034
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,660
been breeding for nine

1035
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,579
he hasn't sold many seeds because he

1036
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:01,078
really isn't a sales guy but I've

1037
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,180
personally been growing his seeds for

1038
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,640
years and I know I can always rely on

1039
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:08,219
his seeds to germinate Thrive and smell

1040
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:10,259
and taste great I suggested to Craig

1041
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:12,539
that he should probably sell some seeds

1042
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,240
and asked if he had enough stockpile to

1043
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:18,000
bother much to my shock he was sitting

1044
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:19,739
on five full menus in Cold Storage that

1045
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,900
he produced in the last two years and

1046
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:25,259
hadn't even tried to sell any of them he

1047
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,940
was simply too busy breeding well we his

1048
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,920
friends convinced him to make his damn

1049
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,940

00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,119
my guest today is molecular

1134
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,619
pharmacologist Jehan Marco PhD so you

1135
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,660
know Jan during the first set you know

1136
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:45,660
you were very clear that um we are

1137
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:48,779
seeing more of these pharmaceutical and

1138
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:51,179
cannabis so cannabinoid interactions

1139
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,160
um you know for two big reasons one

1140
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:55,318
being there's more people using cannabis

1141
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,659
and and then two there's more people

1142
00:45:55,318 --> 00:46:00,838
researching it and and collecting the

1143
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:03,000
data on this stuff which is really great

1144
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:04,799
um I would have to think that like not

1145
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,199
only is there just like more people

1146
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,079
though using cannabis

1147
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:12,239
um cannabis itself is expanded we're

1148
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,220
suddenly accessing all these like new

1149
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,858
new cannabinoids that we are

1150
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:19,500
experiencing in in higher amounts than

1151
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:21,838
they would have in land races and we're

1152
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,280
also got like new ways to use cannabis

1153
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,259
like dabbing where you're suddenly

1154
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,380
getting all these terpenes and

1155
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,480
cannabinoids at one time and you know

1156
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:33,539
it's not uncommon for for people to like

1157
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,858
feel over after like a fat dab and um

1158
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:37,559
you know there's just there's just like

1159
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:40,980
so much there's so much more than we as

1160
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:43,380
humans ever interacted with when we were

1161
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,719
you know you know walking the planes and

1162
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,180
and mountains and and pulling cannabis

1163
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:50,459
plants out and and getting you know the

1164
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:52,078
kind of land Races they had you know 10

1165
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,880
000 years ago or whatever

1166
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,060
um will you speak to that like to what

1167
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:00,780
effect these new methods uh and new

1168
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:03,779
ranges of cannabinoids are having on um

1169
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:06,180
the interaction with Pharmaceuticals huh

1170
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,099
you know absolutely you know I think you

1171
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:10,318
know our ancestors you know used to just

1172
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:12,480
eat cannabis and you know clear some

1173
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,460
land and there'd be more cannabis

1174
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,960
growing and fresh cut land you know they

1175
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,960
they didn't have

1176
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,059
um you know access to chemicals like

1177
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,059
butane and shoved it in a tube and

1178
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:26,039
extracted I mean they would do manual

1179
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:27,179
extractions and and so I think it's

1180
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:29,159
always important to remember that

1181
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:31,379
concentrating cannabis has been around

1182
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:34,199
for a long time

1183
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,539
um you know hashish uh you know Arab

1184
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:38,219
Merchants uh you used to trade it up and

1185
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:40,980
down the coast of Africa some of the

1186
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:44,159
earliest reports about cannabis use are

1187
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,139
these black sheesh bars

1188
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:49,078
um with guys riding basically naked and

1189
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:51,900
horseback into villages to trade these

1190
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:56,099
products but the composition of the

1191
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:58,260
matter has changed greatly and

1192
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:01,019
I you know

1193
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:04,200
there you know this always reminds me of

1194
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:05,838
a mantra a phrase or principle from my

1195
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:08,699
colleague Teresa Simon who's

1196
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:11,400
epidemiologist and we've done a lot of

1197
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:13,078
database mining FDA database Adverse

1198
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,940
Events databases

1199
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,800
um collection tools um like the

1200
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,838
budsinfo.com thing where we collect

1201
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,700
experiential data and Adverse Events

1202
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:22,818
from Cannabis products it's a part of a

1203
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:25,259
student project but she says this thing

1204
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:27,000
seems like every week at every meeting

1205
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:32,579
she says um

1206
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:35,639
uh efficacy gets it on the market safety

1207
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:37,800
keeps it on the market and I think if

1208
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:40,379
we've all been in the Cannabis industry

1209
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,700
more than two years three years we can

1210
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,220
all probably think of one or two

1211
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:47,219
products that hit the market because

1212
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:50,219
they were effective where are they now

1213
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:53,159
and we have to really pause and think

1214
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:55,259
about that we have to think about

1215
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:57,719
a little bit about our commitments here

1216
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:00,540
when we put these products out there and

1217
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:02,879
you know I'm trying to get back to your

1218
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:05,519
question as I've meandered off the path

1219
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,619
a little bit but it just made me think

1220
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,420
about you know

1221
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:13,380
a lot of these products are

1222
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:15,119
concentrating things beyond what our

1223
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:18,059
ancestors would have you know

1224
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:22,079
encountered in the wild

1225
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:23,759
um you know uh CBL and all these other

1226
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,680
cannabinoids I mean they've never been

1227
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,140
consumed in large amounts it's

1228
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,239
unprecedented in our you know in our in

1229
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:33,118
our time frame I mean people even 20

1230
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:35,459
years ago weren't really consuming huge

1231
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,579
amounts of purified cannabinoids even

1232
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,920
the the distribution of cannabinoids and

1233
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:43,800
products in concentrated products from

1234
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:47,519
Morocco over the central uses not nearly

1235
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:50,519
compare to the Purity and refinement of

1236
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,920
these dabs waxes shatters whatever you

1237
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:55,500
want to call it uh the stuff that looks

1238
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,619
like earwax that uh

1239
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,300
things like that and you know we're this

1240
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:04,858
that there's no there's no question

1241
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:09,300
those are very efficient products to

1242
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:13,799
deliver cannabinoids into your body

1243
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:16,019
what is unclear is what is the trade-off

1244
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,000
what are the what's the risk benefits to

1245
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:19,500
using that and do you need to use as

1246
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,858
much as you're using or could you use

1247
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:24,659
less and I think that those are

1248
00:50:22,858 --> 00:50:27,420
questions we have

1249
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:29,159
um you know we think about

1250
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:31,440
um you know there's this old question uh

1251
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,299
the dose you know makes the poison you

1252
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,420
know nothing is poisonous everything is

1253
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:39,000
poisonous it's all a matter of dose and

1254
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:42,720
you know we think about terpenes you

1255
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,940
know at ambient air levels terpenes have

1256
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,159
are wonderful

1257
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,200
um you walk into a grocery store and

1258
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:51,899
they've got that produce section it

1259
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:54,179
smells great to be there Cool Breeze the

1260
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,880
light smell of chlorophyll and maybe

1261
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:59,639
they have some flowers going but if you

1262
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,619
concentrate some of those products

1263
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:04,858
um you know you'll find them as cleaning

1264
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:07,500
agents limonene is a good one it's

1265
00:51:04,858 --> 00:51:10,259
delicious and refreshing and uplifting

1266
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:13,260
in lemonade and even on a cannabis

1267
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,480
product has been reported

1268
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,400
but if you concentrate it it makes a

1269
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,579
great cleaning agent it can strip a

1270
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,440
sticker off a metal wall

1271
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:24,539
not necessarily something you want to

1272
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,420
inhale into your lungs is a pure

1273
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:28,980
concentrated terpenes and and it also

1274
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,260
depends again like

1275
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,900
there are terpenes that

1276
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:37,500
you shouldn't even using a diffuser if

1277
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:39,480
you have a small pet like a cat and so

1278
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,280
again I think we always have to think

1279
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,679
about

1280
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,260
um that some of these compounds do carry

1281
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:47,179
risks it's not like they're safe at any

1282
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:50,579
level

1283
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:52,078
you know without risk at any level and

1284
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,539
and what I'm really talking about here

1285
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,280
is you know uh

1286
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:58,199
there are moments where we should pause

1287
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,940
and think there are there are red lights

1288
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,858
there are yellow lights there's proceed

1289
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,539
with normal precautions there's proceed

1290
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:07,440
with extra precautions and there's

1291
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:12,058
considerate Alternatives and I think you

1292
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,318
know we're really lucky that THC CBD low

1293
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,480
toxicity

1294
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:18,599
great therapeutic index I mean they're

1295
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:21,599
both FDA approved in one form

1296
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:24,000
um you know we're the THC appears in

1297
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,519
three scheduling categories

1298
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,139
um if it's below a certain amount um you

1299
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:30,358
know it's been legalized in the form of

1300
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,699
hemp I mean hemp chocolates can have

1301
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:34,920
more THC in them than a THC product you

1302
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:37,318
buy at a dispensary I mean it's so

1303
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:40,079
clearly they've you know through

1304
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:41,759
regulation and stuff like that and even

1305
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,039
this public health experiment we have

1306
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,940
going on we found that hey you know

1307
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:52,440
there are certain you know levels that

1308
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:54,900
are lower risk than others and and THC

1309
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,300
CBD again just because they're

1310
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:00,720
relatively safe it doesn't mean that

1311
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,579
every single thing on the plant is

1312
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,459
relatively safe

1313
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:07,619
um you know so I think we have to be

1314
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,900
it's good to be optimistic but also to

1315
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:13,318
have skepticism skepticism is our friend

1316
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:15,358
like you know okay THC CBD we know about

1317
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:17,519
them we know about their acidic

1318
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,219
components a little bit but what do we

1319
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,960
know about the you know other 100 or so

1320
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:24,199
compounds that can be found on it in

1321
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:28,019
small amounts you know I think of

1322
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:30,480
uh you know things in nature the most

1323
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:33,179
potent things in nature are often there

1324
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,500
in the smallest amounts

1325
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:36,779
um you know if you look at marine

1326
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,000
biology like nematodes and other stuff

1327
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,099
like that for documentaries they have

1328
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,139
you know really potent compounds for

1329
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:45,000
defense in them and they're usually you

1330
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:47,578
know small amounts

1331
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,039
um and you know we think about things

1332
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:52,500
like it's thcp and these other things

1333
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:54,239
that are like oh 100 times more potent

1334
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,500
and it's like what does that really mean

1335
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,118
you know what does that mean does it

1336
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,380
mean it's just going to be more

1337
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,420
pleasurable or does it mean you're going

1338
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,220
to be catatonic for three or four days

1339
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:05,159
if you consume a large amount of it and

1340
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:05,818
then and these stories

1341
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,399
um

1342
00:54:05,818 --> 00:54:10,980
are not often popularized for for a

1343
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,220
number of reasons but there are stories

1344
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,420
you know back in the you know back in

1345
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:18,000
the

1346
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:20,880
decades ago it was very common for

1347
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,679
pharmacologists who develop drugs this

1348
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,838
is something they phased out when I was

1349
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:26,279
a graduate student so no fun for me but

1350
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:28,078
the most one of the most common things

1351
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,819
was the pharmacologist to take it to see

1352
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,920
if it actually worked

1353
00:54:29,818 --> 00:54:35,039
um and it usually ended with a student

1354
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,900
being doubled over a sink vomiting but

1355
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,000
um you know that was what people would

1356
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,400
do and I think we have to there are lots

1357
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,920
of stories if you go to conferences and

1358
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,780
you ask around oh has anyone ever taken

1359
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,240
this compound that's a hundred to a

1360
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,519
thousand times more potent than THC

1361
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:53,399
someone may tell you a story yeah that

1362
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:55,139
guy was catatonic for five days and Lana

1363
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,720
is floor of his kitchen you know and

1364
00:54:55,139 --> 00:55:00,058
stuff like that but but again that's not

1365
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:01,558
to say that or I'm not and I'm not

1366
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:04,859
saying that any compounds like that

1367
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:06,359
exist on the market that we know of but

1368
00:55:04,858 --> 00:55:08,159
again I'm just wanting to get the idea

1369
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:10,078
that you know small changes to a

1370
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,078
molecule small differences can have

1371
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:16,019
dramatic effects you know ethanol we

1372
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:19,260
like to drink it methanol can make us go

1373
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:20,880
blind uh there there's a very subtle

1374
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,040
difference in their chemical structure

1375
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,079
right on I want to tie a couple of

1376
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,480
things that you said together for the

1377
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,160
caregivers who are listening because you

1378
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,780
know as as you know everybody who

1379
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:33,420
listens to the show knows that like I'm

1380
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,859
a very patient-centric and while I

1381
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,119
myself have not a healthcare

1382
00:55:34,858 --> 00:55:37,380
professional

1383
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,780
um because of the role I play in the

1384
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:42,240
community I talk to a lot of patients

1385
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:44,640
and have have heard you know anecdotal

1386
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,500
stories and like you know over a

1387
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,318
thousand patients and so if you're a

1388
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,880
caregiver based on what Jahan just said

1389
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:52,699
these are the couple of the takeaways

1390
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,838
that that I would offer which would be

1391
00:55:52,699 --> 00:55:57,719
number one

1392
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,980
um just because you've had a can a just

1393
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:01,558
because you're working with a patient or

1394
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:04,199
you are a patient who has always used

1395
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:07,079
cannabis and and has used a particular

1396
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:09,179
pharmaceutical for a long time don't

1397
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,559
take out a possibility that the Cannabis

1398
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:14,039
and the pharmaceutical could be

1399
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,079
interacting in a new way now because the

1400
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:18,659
Cannabis that is available to you as a

1401
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,240
patient has now changed maybe you're no

1402
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:24,299
longer just you know you know smoking

1403
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:26,818
your home grow and and rolling up joints

1404
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:29,818
and and using that for your pain maybe

1405
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:31,920
now you are dabbing and maybe you are

1406
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:35,699
taking Edibles with you know 200

1407
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,858
milligrams of THC or maybe you are

1408
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:39,539
um you're dabbing and you are

1409
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:41,759
supplementing with straight terpenes

1410
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:43,858
which I see people do which is like

1411
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,380
is so dangerous

1412
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:49,980
um because there's there's no scientific

1413
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:53,039
history uh of us of us dabbing straight

1414
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:56,219
terpenes like that and so so you know

1415
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:58,800
I'm not saying don't dab I'm not saying

1416
00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:00,358
um you know don't amend with terpenes in

1417
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,660
your Edibles other things what I'm

1418
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:04,858
saying is is you as a patient or as a

1419
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:06,838
caregiver

1420
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:10,318
um uh it is it is a helpful perspective

1421
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:12,539
to realize that as cannabis changes and

1422
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:15,838
in as it's not the same cannabis that we

1423
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:18,960
had 30 years ago that the patient's

1424
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:22,920
relationship with cannabinoids and the

1425
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:26,039
Pharmaceuticals might change as well

1426
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,960
um so moving on from from that to the

1427
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:30,119
next area uh jayhan you know I wanted to

1428
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,440
talk just briefly about isolate versus

1429
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:34,380
whole plant

1430
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,059
um uh medicines because you know uh I

1431
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,760
I've warmed up to isolates a little bit

1432
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:41,400
uh I I I I've never really had all that

1433
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,680
much good to say about isolates I'm a

1434
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,660
big fan of of whole plant

1435
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,879
um cannabis preparations

1436
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:51,960
um but I've had to be more open to

1437
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:54,240
isolate as as the breeding for uh

1438
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,980
specific uh you know blends of

1439
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:59,699
cannabinoids and plants is you know

1440
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:02,639
going slower than we want it to go to be

1441
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:04,379
able to relieve the suffering of of so

1442
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,440
many patients and so you know before

1443
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,818
before CBD was available everywhere

1444
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,338
um you know we eventually figured out

1445
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,440
that okay if you've got a THC type 1

1446
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:15,480
plant but you don't have access to CBD

1447
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,000
all right spiking it with some CBD

1448
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,159
isolate in the presence of the rest of

1449
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,739
the cannabinoids in the in the whole

1450
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:25,558
plant resin that's probably a good thing

1451
00:58:22,739 --> 00:58:27,659
and and you know you know Dr Agarwal and

1452
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:28,859
and Dr Russo have all been on the show

1453
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:30,960
and have said you know that's that

1454
00:58:28,858 --> 00:58:34,920
sounds like a really good idea

1455
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,838
um and so more of us are using isolate

1456
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,460
um here and there to to spike our

1457
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:40,558
different preparations on the other side

1458
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,019
you've got pharmaceutical companies that

1459
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,019
are using you know isolate and hand

1460
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:48,059
chosen terpenes to make

1461
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:50,099
um you know you know the early

1462
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:52,619
endocannabinoid drugs like uh like

1463
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:54,119
epidiolex right which you know you know

1464
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:56,760
when I read the when I read the

1465
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:58,858
descriptions you know it it it smacks of

1466
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,839
like kind of Frankenstein's monster to

1467
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:03,239
me a bit I would much rather have a

1468
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:05,759
plant that is a two to one CBD to THC

1469
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:08,098
with a proper terpene profile and and

1470
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,720
have it in the resin from the plant and

1471
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:12,298
then just use the plant right because

1472
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:13,980
there's there's thousands of years of

1473
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,880
good relationship between us and the

1474
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:19,858
plant that I think is

1475
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,559
less effective when we when we tear it

1476
00:59:19,858 --> 00:59:24,779
all down and and put it in into a

1477
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,579
pharmaceutical but you know we have

1478
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,140
we're going into this direction and

1479
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:31,380
certainly helping people and that's good

1480
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:33,659
so I've had to soften my opinionated on

1481
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,700
this you know so so this is all circling

1482
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:37,500
around to this question is that when

1483
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:39,179
we're talking about interactions with

1484
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,519
other Pharmaceuticals are there any

1485
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:43,980
things that we should um as cannabis

1486
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:46,739
patients or as caregivers be aware of

1487
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:49,440
how isolates might interact with

1488
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:52,259
Pharmaceuticals differently than how

1489
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,280
whole plant preparations like rosins and

1490
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:56,059
stuff might interact with

1491
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,059
Pharmaceuticals

1492
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:04,318
you know that it's a question that

1493
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:08,640
um you the answer is yes and no you know

1494
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:12,298
to give a truly academic response so you

1495
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:15,000
know spiking adulterating or you know

1496
01:00:12,298 --> 01:00:16,559
can be one in the same term

1497
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,599
um so I might use them interchangeably

1498
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,819
as I just kind of speak off the cuff but

1499
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:22,500
you know

1500
01:00:19,818 --> 01:00:24,779
mixing let's start with ancient times

1501
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,920
right right so so changing the

1502
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:28,920
composition of something you're

1503
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,200
consuming for the purposes of uh

1504
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,579
psychoactive effect is is not a new

1505
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:36,379
practice

1506
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:39,720
um I would uh I I would give you very

1507
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:42,358
poor odds against the idea that our

1508
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:45,058
ancestors mixed lots of plant products

1509
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:46,980
together and smoked them I'm willing to

1510
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:48,500
bet that things like lavender or

1511
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,818
chamomile and

1512
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:53,400
calamus root I think even some of these

1513
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:56,338
have been documented or smoked probably

1514
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,798
mixed with cannabis not all too

1515
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:01,500
different in concept from spiking with

1516
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:04,440
terpenes adding a foreign compound to

1517
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,358
the mix indeed like sad of X that's like

1518
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:10,139
what you're describing sounds like how

1519
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:11,880
sad of X is made uh the the the the oral

1520
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:13,379
mucosal the tincture that's sprayed

1521
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,940
under the tongue that's licensed in over

1522
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,160
30 countries but not in the United

1523
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,500
States

1524
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:22,558
that is two cannabis varieties extracted

1525
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:25,199
by CO2 extraction turned in an oil and

1526
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:29,460
mixed together to get this nice ratio of

1527
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:34,019
uh one to one THC to CBD so it's a

1528
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:36,960
proven strategy or tactic in

1529
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:39,259
preparing medicine and making consumer

1530
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,539
products

1531
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:45,599
anytime you are increasing the dose or

1532
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:47,119
your exposure you're introducing new

1533
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,380
complications

1534
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,240
cannabinoids are waxy and sticky

1535
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:53,579
compounds

1536
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:56,699
um and you know if you're really

1537
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:58,798
consuming a lot of the stuff it can

1538
01:01:56,699 --> 01:02:01,019
stick to everything it can stick to your

1539
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:03,719
teeth it can start to stick to your

1540
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:06,780
lungs there's been some people who

1541
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:11,519
um have wet and I'm talking extreme like

1542
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:14,519
a lasagna tray of you know dab sort of

1543
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:16,199
thing just to be you know a little silly

1544
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:19,380
there but they're they're consuming a

1545
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:22,439
lot it can coat Airways it can collect

1546
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:25,200
on material and things like that and

1547
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:28,139
that that that may be a bad time for for

1548
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:31,259
some folks so again but that's not going

1549
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:33,078
to happen with moderate or or low use of

1550
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:37,140
these products I mean

1551
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:40,318
typically you can't you know what's sold

1552
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:42,900
in a lot of adult use stores

1553
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:46,259
um regulated adult use dispensaries is

1554
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:48,000
is really not enough to induce some of

1555
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:50,400
these things but again

1556
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,079
your chronic consumption of concentrated

1557
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,760
products can introduce

1558
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:57,200
you know

1559
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,200
new things and I guess

1560
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:05,519
um let's let's use an analogy

1561
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,619
um let's talk like beer

1562
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:08,280
right versus

1563
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:11,579
um

1564
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:14,400
you know vodka right beer few percent

1565
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:16,980
alcohol maybe eight percent that's a

1566
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,660
pretty potent beer here right you know

1567
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:22,619
vodka they don't even use percents they

1568
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:25,318
use proofs uh you know it could be quite

1569
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:27,900
uh it could be quite a lot more potent

1570
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:30,558
by an order of magnitude even wine wine

1571
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:33,900
can be you know upwards of 20 alcohol

1572
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,940
that's you know twice as much that's uh

1573
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,818
than a beer you know if you're time 40

1574
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:40,980
to 60 by weight alcohol I mean you could

1575
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:42,900
be adding a zero onto the percentage of

1576
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,539
a beer beer is five percent

1577
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:48,480
and you have a alcoholic beverage that's

1578
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:50,400
above 50 alcohol that's an order of

1579
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,858
magnitude more ethanol so if you're

1580
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,079
drinking a beer you know you have all

1581
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:57,719
these other things in there uh you know

1582
01:03:55,079 --> 01:04:00,660
you got some some flavor compounds you

1583
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:02,818
know a nice big double hopped IPA you

1584
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:04,858
know they just they smell amazing if

1585
01:04:02,818 --> 01:04:07,019
you're into plants um you can you can

1586
01:04:04,858 --> 01:04:09,480
smell the terpenes from the hops plant

1587
01:04:07,019 --> 01:04:11,639
you can there are other compounds in

1588
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,760
there that give it flavor and body and

1589
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:16,558
color it's it's a bit dilute though the

1590
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,720
alcohol in that mixture you're you're

1591
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,160
drinking like liquid bread in a sense

1592
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:21,539
you know if you look at like a Guinness

1593
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,098
for example

1594
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:25,259
um or some of those more heavier beers

1595
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:26,700
unfiltered beers there's other

1596
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:28,619
components now

1597
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:30,659
what is the difference between a beer

1598
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:33,000
and vodka

1599
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:34,798
well I just you know we can describe it

1600
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,679
in terms of smell and taste but you can

1601
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:39,539
also describe it in terms of calories

1602
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:43,318
and what else is in there and is it

1603
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:45,539
better to drink the ethanol in a liquid

1604
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:48,779
bread preparation or is it better to

1605
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:51,000
drink it in a pure form and I wanted to

1606
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:54,720
use something that perhaps people who

1607
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,059
don't use dabs or extracts or are

1608
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:59,159
considering it to give them

1609
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:02,760
you know an analogy to think about when

1610
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:05,460
it comes to these products uh I think

1611
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:08,460
the idea of adding a compound to

1612
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:11,880
mitigate the side effects like putting

1613
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:13,500
CBD in a product to decrease the

1614
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,318
potential adverse effects of someone

1615
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,940
who's sensitive to THC I think that's a

1616
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:20,519
wonderful idea

1617
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:23,039
um and I'd love to see I think more more

1618
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:26,639
of that available to people it's this

1619
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:28,440
form of compound pharmacy I think

1620
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:32,578
um and so

1621
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:35,159
I think uh you know it seems

1622
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:37,318
I feel like you know these extracts have

1623
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:39,058
a utility I think especially in people

1624
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:41,338
with severe conditions cancer

1625
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:43,798
chemotherapy

1626
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:46,078
um extremely difficult to treat

1627
01:05:43,798 --> 01:05:48,780
neurodegenerative disorders you know

1628
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:50,519
when we look at CBD even

1629
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:53,160
um you know the average person you know

1630
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:55,798
buys a boutique CBD product might have

1631
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:59,159
five milligrams in it maybe 20 and

1632
01:05:55,798 --> 01:06:00,539
they're like I feel so relaxed but if

1633
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:02,338
you look at what's being used in the

1634
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:05,719
clinic we're talking hundreds of

1635
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:09,179
milligrams of CBD for an effect so

1636
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:11,459
we can't really say oh it's bad and this

1637
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:14,279
is good it's it's all a bit of a

1638
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:17,940
spectrum in terms of the context of use

1639
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:20,040
and why you're using it but again the

1640
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:22,559
more you take of something the more you

1641
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:24,779
have in your body again I use the

1642
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,298
analogy of the guy walking around town

1643
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:29,039
with nothing to do might just get into

1644
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:32,280
trouble if they walk down the wrong

1645
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,420
alley so I think about that a little bit

1646
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,319
too

1647
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,000
um you know if you're hanging out

1648
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:37,739
playing in the street because you got

1649
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,159
nothing to do it's all fine until the

1650
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:43,139
wrong car comes along you know so there

1651
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:45,538
are things like that I I think about too

1652
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:47,279
so if you're using a lot of cannabinoids

1653
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:49,140
and suddenly you get a new prescription

1654
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,940
medication

1655
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:52,679
um you know that might present some

1656
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:55,019
complications that's why you know that

1657
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:57,480
they have that advice you know go low

1658
01:06:55,019 --> 01:07:00,358
start low and go slow take it at night

1659
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,559
when you're using new products it's to

1660
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:03,239
sort of give you're like I'm going to

1661
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,980
use it in a safe place I'm going to use

1662
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:06,899
a small amount and I'm going to write

1663
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:09,420
down what happened and how I felt just

1664
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:11,780
so I can start to track things because

1665
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:13,980
no one's really

1666
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:15,660
I don't think either one of us are

1667
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:17,460
saying

1668
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:18,838
um you know we're not telling people not

1669
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:20,599
to use it we think we're just giving

1670
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:23,038
them pause to think about it you know

1671
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:24,960
exactly exactly no know what you're

1672
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,339
doing and just because other people are

1673
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,699
doing it doesn't mean that it's

1674
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:33,019
necessarily right for you you know make

1675
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:33,019
make informed choices

1676
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:40,619
absolutely and I and I think about

1677
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:42,298
you know I uh I don't golf that often um

1678
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:44,099
and when I do it's it's pretty terrible

1679
01:07:42,298 --> 01:07:46,318
but

1680
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:48,480
um you know I think the same thing for

1681
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,699
the Cannabis is the same thing uh the

1682
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,980
things I like in golf are putting the

1683
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:56,038
slow putts the short distance things you

1684
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:57,960
know hitting whacking the ball as hard

1685
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:59,940
as you can with as much force as you can

1686
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:03,780
to go as far as you can

1687
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:06,659
you know taking heroic doses of things

1688
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:08,940
you know it's uh you might spend a lot

1689
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:10,519
of time wondering just where that ball

1690
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:13,440
is

1691
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:15,420
versus you know putting you got a green

1692
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:19,380
there's a lot there's still a lot of fun

1693
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:21,539
there and a challenge there as well

1694
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:23,338
um but again it's It's Different Strokes

1695
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:26,338
for different folks but again I would

1696
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:27,960
really just give people pause about that

1697
01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:30,238
because you want to take a holistic

1698
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,219
approach with this and and you know you

1699
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,358
when it comes to patients you know

1700
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:34,798
especially avoiding drug drug

1701
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,219
interactions there might be a real

1702
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:40,500
strategy here maybe you prefer edibles

1703
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:42,539
but the Edibles stick around so long

1704
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,460
because they're they're swallowed they

1705
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:47,519
go through GI tract then they go to the

1706
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:50,759
liver Just Like A Pill

1707
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,799
however inhalation avoids that first

1708
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:54,779
round eventually does get metabolized

1709
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:57,899
but it avoids that first round past

1710
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:59,520
metabolism so if you're consuming uh

1711
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:02,219
let's call it healthy normal cannabis

1712
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:04,560
not not special cannabis not you know

1713
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:06,539
cannabis dipped in hash oil not dabs not

1714
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,798
cannabis with spiked with other

1715
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:13,140
cannabinoids but just good old-fashioned

1716
01:09:09,798 --> 01:09:14,698
uh plant material you know and you're

1717
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,520
inhaling that

1718
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:19,559
you know you might be able to decrease

1719
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,120
your chances as a strategy just

1720
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,339
conceptually you know the amount of

1721
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,858
administration matters swallowing things

1722
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:27,719
makes everything complicated

1723
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:29,460
um there's a reason why satavex and if

1724
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:32,939
you haven't looked into nabiximals or

1725
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:35,640
tinctures I think this is an area worthy

1726
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:37,500
of further development taking a product

1727
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,420
that can be applied under the tongue or

1728
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,920
in the cheek and absorb buchely don't

1729
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,679
swallow it don't don't don't even

1730
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:45,480
visualize yourself swallowing it I don't

1731
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,899
want any Placebo effects on this podcast

1732
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:50,818
but you uh you absorb it beautifully it

1733
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:54,479
goes into your mouth and goes right into

1734
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:56,340
your brain like why sand the the

1735
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,379
cannabinoids on a wild goose chase

1736
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:00,420
through your digestive tract and through

1737
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:02,039
the body oh they got to go all travel

1738
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:04,319
through the whole body before they get

1739
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:06,238
to the brain it's a little little crazy

1740
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:07,979
trip they have to take so why not just

1741
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:10,519
load the Magic School Bus and send it

1742
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:13,919
right right to the brain and avoiding

1743
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:15,600
some complications potentially so you

1744
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,179
have options you know the point of this

1745
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:21,199
is is your only option isn't inhalation

1746
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:23,520
your only option isn't oral

1747
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:25,319
there are potentially other strategies

1748
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,719
that you could use and I think these are

1749
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:30,779
great conversations to have with the

1750
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:33,260
your PCP your primary care physician not

1751
01:10:30,779 --> 01:10:36,859
talking about another drug there but

1752
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:39,480
there or any medical health professional

1753
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:41,639
doctors are trained to talk about drug

1754
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:43,259
drug interactions they can look up any

1755
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:45,420
of this information quickly or you can

1756
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:48,179
you know reach out to me or check out

1757
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:51,300
you know rewind the show and pull some

1758
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:52,560
of the the references we talk about and

1759
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,420
bring those to your clinician I used to

1760
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,520
advise medical cannabis patients I did a

1761
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,960
lot of advocacy I'd give them you know

1762
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,600
papers I'm sure there's like a couple

1763
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,340
clinicians at like Kaiser or some

1764
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,440
medical place in California are being

1765
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:06,239
like who the hell was giving my patients

1766
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:08,819
all those peer-reviewed studies and

1767
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:10,979
having them bring them to my office you

1768
01:11:08,819 --> 01:11:13,079
know so I was sometimes arming medical

1769
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:14,459
cannabis patients with peer-reviewed

1770
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:16,380
studies to share with their clinician to

1771
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,480
have have these types of discussion how

1772
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:21,119
should I consume it what are the

1773
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:25,218
benefits and risks of consuming these

1774
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:30,059
products topically orally sub mucosally

1775
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:32,399
by inhalation and these are all and in

1776
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,719
what amounts and things like that so

1777
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:36,238
these are all

1778
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:37,439
great conversations to continue to have

1779
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:39,119
and as you said it's going to continue

1780
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:41,759
to change because products change

1781
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:43,859
varieties of cannabis change

1782
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,119
um and I think it's always good to just

1783
01:11:43,859 --> 01:11:49,198
check in

1784
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:51,119
about that right on so um when we come

1785
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:53,460
back from our commercial break in set

1786
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:57,679
three we're going to talk about some uh

1787
01:11:53,460 --> 01:12:01,020
red flag drugs and categories of drugs

1788
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:04,140
that we want to be especially aware of

1789
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:05,400
if you are a cannabis patient or you are

1790
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,440
doing

1791
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:11,219
um you know caregiving for somebody else

1792
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:13,139
and we'll go through those with jayhan

1793
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:14,760
so uh we're going to take a short break

1794
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:16,440
and be right back you are listening to

1795
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:20,390
shaping fire and my guest today is

1796
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:22,500
molecular pharmacologist Jehan Marco PhD

1797
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:24,900
[Music]

1798
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:27,119
online cannabis seed Distributors often

1799
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:28,859
seem to be all the same but Multiverse

1800
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:30,539
beans constantly Works to provide you

1801
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:33,000
with cannabis seeds and a buying

1802
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:35,219
experience that you won't find elsewhere

1803
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,319
Multiverse beans Works directly with the

1804
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:39,480

favorites as possible so that they have

1806
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:43,859
your favorite beans long after others

1807

pharmacologist Jehan Marco PhD so jayhan

1954
01:18:12,779 --> 01:18:16,679
you know we we've talked a lot about

1955
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,840
um like the the mindset and the

1956
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:20,579
perspectives and the complexity and

1957
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,739
we've teased these things apart mostly

1958
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:25,198
just so people can see like all these

1959
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:27,959
different avenues that we could say are

1960
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:29,819
Avenues of of concern but they're really

1961
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,920
Avenues of solutions right because

1962
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:35,039
usually by the time

1963
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:37,619
um a cannabis patient is either a us and

1964
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:39,960
sick or B we are a caregiver and we've

1965
01:18:37,619 --> 01:18:43,319
been called in to help out

1966
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:46,079
um usually there is um a problem to be

1967
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:49,679
you know resolved and and healing to be

1968
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:52,979
applied and and so what I want to ask

1969
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:56,880
you is that uh there have got to be some

1970
01:18:52,979 --> 01:19:00,178
some categories of pharmaceuticals that

1971
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,800
are just red flag because they are you

1972
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:04,560
know like up up at the top of the list

1973
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:07,440
of drugs that are likely to interact

1974
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,900
with cannabis and and while while our

1975
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:12,299
goal today has been to like hopefully

1976
01:19:09,899 --> 01:19:15,479
arm cannabis patients and caregivers

1977
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:17,940
with lots of different ways to you know

1978
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:19,500
dive into what they're trying to suss

1979
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:21,419
out

1980
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:25,619
um there's probably a few that we should

1981
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:26,940
just put a big red flag on and so so why

1982
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:28,679
don't we go through two or three of

1983
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:30,960
these so so what's at the top of your

1984
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:32,699
list of red flag drugs

1985
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:36,300
um that are going to interact in

1986
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:37,678
cannabis in potentially sketchy ways

1987
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,480
so

1988
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:41,279
um things to be concerned about first

1989
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:43,198
I'm going to start with alphabet soup

1990
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:46,500
real quick and then we'll go into more

1991
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:48,359
specifics but if you are taking

1992
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,899
um potential drug drug interactions have

1993
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:53,759
to do with drugs or looking at sip cyp

1994
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:55,979
2c9 Healthcare professionals will know

1995
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,600
exactly what you're talking about so if

1996
01:19:55,979 --> 01:19:59,339
you are listening pulling out a little

1997
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,560
piece of paper and writing these down

1998
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:06,500
and then throwing them into a search

1999
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:13,500
browser will reveal all but uh sip2c9

2000
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:16,939
sip1a2 Sip 2b6 and sip 2C 19 and even

2001
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:21,020
some of the acidic cannabinoids like THC

2002
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:24,359
thcva CBD cbdva

2003
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:26,699
cpga these all interact for example with

2004
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:29,099
SIP two C9 so if you have taking a

2005
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:30,779
medication which is probably you know

2006
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:34,440
it's very these are very common targets

2007
01:20:30,779 --> 01:20:38,219
of medications you could have a victim

2008
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:40,859
perpetrator effect going on so a couple

2009
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:43,260
of red flag potentials you know

2010
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:45,839
um you know I used to think like I want

2011
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:47,699
uh you know I already uh you know have

2012
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,840
my own podcast as well and I thought

2013
01:20:47,698 --> 01:20:50,279
about starting another one just called

2014
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,140
what the hell happened where people

2015
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:54,179
would call in with

2016
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:56,219
um drug experiences and be like I was

2017
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:58,800
doing fine I was having fun at this

2018
01:20:56,219 --> 01:21:01,198
party and I just got light-headed and

2019
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:04,140
passed out and like what the hell

2020
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:06,299
happened and you know these stories um

2021
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,880
you know joke a little bit there to cut

2022
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:11,159
the tension because this is about

2023
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:13,739
hypertension and hypotension and and the

2024
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:16,500
hypotensive effects of cannabis most

2025
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:18,119
people probably don't even notice or

2026
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,520
it's Transit you've been sitting down

2027
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:23,099
for a while playing a board game or

2028
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,080
whatever you know FIFA on your Xbox and

2029
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:28,320
you if you step up oh I feel a little

2030
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:30,719
light-headed and then you like oh oh I'm

2031
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:31,859
better now but some people that is is

2032
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,198
really severe so if you're taking

2033
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:36,779
cardiovascular medication I think and

2034
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:39,960
you have a cardiovascular Condition it's

2035
01:21:36,779 --> 01:21:41,759
a great idea to really pause and think

2036
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,380
about things and maybe have a discussion

2037
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,179
because

2038
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:48,539
um cannabis does cause hypotension the

2039
01:21:45,179 --> 01:21:50,520
blood vessels uh you know will dilate

2040
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:51,960
um and and the heart will work a little

2041
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,380
harder to pump blood around because you

2042
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:57,960
know things are a little more relaxed

2043
01:21:54,380 --> 01:22:00,840
but that hypotension could result in

2044
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:03,719
being so lightheaded that you have to

2045
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:05,400
sit down or you know you really feel the

2046
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:07,439
pull of the gravity of the earth and

2047
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:09,119
just bam and that could be it could be

2048
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:11,639
bad especially if you hit something on

2049
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:13,679
the way down so I'd say red flag

2050
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:16,500
interaction cardiovascular medications

2051
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:19,199
that treat hypertension

2052
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,359
um you know I I would say look look into

2053
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:23,519
that if you're on anything having to do

2054
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:27,119
with cardiovascular medications all

2055
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,380
right what's another area yeah

2056
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,439
um I'd say

2057
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:33,539
um uh Warfarin and I pronounce drugs a

2058
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:35,639
little weirdly because I had uh my

2059
01:22:33,539 --> 01:22:37,260
mentor was from Lebanon I'm one of our

2060
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:39,840
collaborators that I listened to a lot

2061
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:41,699
uh was born in Scotland and spent 30

2062
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,600
years in Australia so I'm used to

2063
01:22:41,698 --> 01:22:44,599
hearing drugs

2064
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:49,980
and so I don't know the correct way to

2065
01:22:47,219 --> 01:22:51,840
say apoptosis or apoptosis or appetite

2066
01:22:49,979 --> 01:22:53,698
you know there's all these ways so bear

2067
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:57,779
with me here

2068
01:22:53,698 --> 01:22:59,879
um but uh Warfarin is one and this is uh

2069
01:22:57,779 --> 01:23:02,158
most people right

2070
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:04,859
right blood thinning so yeah so you if

2071
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:07,079
you take if that you could potentially

2072
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:09,359
you know this is or cannabinoids are

2073
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:10,738
perpetrators Warfarin will stick around

2074
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,139
longer

2075
01:23:10,738 --> 01:23:14,039
um increase risk of excessive bleeding

2076
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:16,020
there

2077
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:19,140
um so that would be a potential red flag

2078
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:21,659
something to think about consider again

2079
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:24,300
that's where this Mantra we hear or

2080
01:23:21,658 --> 01:23:26,819
start low and go slow comes in we

2081
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:29,000
mentioned clobazam and this really is

2082
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:32,759
again a risk of

2083
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:36,020
benzodiazepine toxicity so uh and most

2084
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:39,600
notably with CBD so again thinking about

2085
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:43,380
benzodiazepines and cannabinoids uh you

2086
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:46,020
may want to proceed slowly there Central

2087
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:48,679
Nervous depressants could have additive

2088
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:52,260
effects we already talked about that

2089
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:55,020
the a lot of the peens the clozapine and

2090
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:57,300
olanzapine will have reduced efficacy

2091
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:58,920
and I think that that

2092
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:02,880
um you know and again I'll just tie it

2093
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:06,899
in the Sip 3a4 and zip2c9

2094
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:09,480
um you know you should think about

2095
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:11,099
um those and drug drug interactions fee

2096
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:14,039
of drugs are metabolized or interact

2097
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:15,300
with those I I would say discuss

2098
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:17,340
Alternatives

2099
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,140
um that might be appropriate in that

2100
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:22,140
instance just based on the literature

2101
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:23,760
and and what's available it may not be

2102
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,260
clinically feasible so you might have to

2103
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,179
consider you know different routes of

2104
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,219
administration or something yeah so you

2105
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:32,880
mentioned the uh the club is in which is

2106
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:35,760
a benzodiazepam so so while that one

2107
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:37,579
most of us don't come across in our

2108
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,619
regular life but I believe another

2109
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:42,899
benzodiazepam is Valium which is like

2110
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:44,698
all through you know our scene and you

2111
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:46,259
know you know your aunt gives one to you

2112
01:24:44,698 --> 01:24:48,479
or whatever you know these are very

2113
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:52,199
common to come across would we should we

2114
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:54,979
be careful similarly mixing valium with

2115
01:24:52,198 --> 01:24:54,979
cannabinoids

2116
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:59,400
um yeah absolutely and I would say

2117
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:02,640
probably true for any anti-anxiety

2118
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:06,119
medication Librium

2119
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:09,539
even antidepressant Zoloft prolax uh

2120
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:11,399
Prozac Lexapro um just like naming

2121
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:13,019
things off the top of my head you know

2122
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:14,819
these things even like carry over to the

2123
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:17,460
Psychedelic space too you know people

2124
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:20,219
you're not supposed to you know go on a

2125
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:22,619
psilocybin therapeutic session while on

2126
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:24,300
these things either and so

2127
01:25:22,619 --> 01:25:27,960
um you know mostly what we're concerned

2128
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:29,760
about with a cannabis or hemp product is

2129
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:33,239
that these increased side effects

2130
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:36,239
dizziness drowsiness confusion and other

2131
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:38,879
difficulties when you're using a

2132
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:41,698
diazepam together with something like

2133
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,500
cannabis now again everyone's going to

2134
01:25:41,698 --> 01:25:45,299
be different

2135
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:47,100
um some people probably listening to be

2136
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,360
like I do that all the time and it's

2137
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,460
fine and other people are going to be

2138
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:52,738
like I'm never doing that again and what

2139
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:55,859
we're really talking about here I think

2140
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:57,539
is you know cannabis can be a beneficial

2141
01:25:55,859 --> 01:26:00,059
thing in people's life and we don't want

2142
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:02,158
it to be a a bad thing we want it to be

2143
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:05,340
a good thing in people's life or at

2144
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:06,899
least have no net effect no net effect

2145
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,760
and a good thing that'd be that'd be

2146
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:12,059
great and so we're really trying to

2147
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:14,520
figure out how do we prevent people from

2148
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:16,260
you know having under the phrase I'm

2149
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,460
never doing that again or that was

2150
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:19,500
terrible

2151
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:20,819
um you know I think of how hard the

2152
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:23,880
Cannabis industry has worked to get

2153
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:25,738
where it is and you don't want a

2154
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:28,500
first-time patient who could benefit

2155
01:26:25,738 --> 01:26:31,559
from Cannabis to get the wrong product

2156
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:33,179
have a drug drug interaction or a side

2157
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,920
effect and say you know what I'm never

2158
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:37,859
touching that stuff again and it might

2159
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:40,560
have just been a simple issue is timing

2160
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:42,179
we're out of administration or again

2161
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,920
dosing

2162
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:46,079
I want to focus on one thing that you

2163
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:49,560
said it makes a lot of sense that if you

2164
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:54,300
would take a a benzodiazepam like valium

2165
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:56,100
or xanax and add THC uh blend to it that

2166
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:58,500
you are going you know you are more

2167
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:01,620
likely to you know have have decreased

2168
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:05,100
dexterity and increase drowsiness and

2169
01:27:01,619 --> 01:27:07,639
you know won't be able to drive your car

2170
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:10,800
as well and these things that like slow

2171
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:13,079
your human down right that all makes

2172
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,940
sense but you caught me off guard when

2173
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:18,479
you when you mentioned those ssris

2174
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:22,738
because so many people who are taking

2175
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:25,019
you know uh you know some of these these

2176
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:27,419
um you know long-term anxiety and

2177
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:29,340
depression medications like Wellbutrin

2178
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:31,739
and and you know that whole basket that

2179
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:34,139
you mentioned many of them also

2180
01:27:31,738 --> 01:27:36,899
supplement with cannabis either for

2181
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:40,440
quality of life or just you know because

2182
01:27:36,899 --> 01:27:41,759
they still have residual anxiety even on

2183
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:45,839
those drugs

2184
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:48,480
um what is the mechanism of cannabis

2185
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,460
interacting with this this basket of

2186
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:52,319
drugs and is there anything that

2187
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:56,239
patients who are blending those

2188
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:56,238
themselves at home should watch out for

2189
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,039
great

2190
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:01,079
um

2191
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:01,698
great question there

2192
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:04,319
um

2193
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:07,460
let me think about

2194
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:07,460
that for a second

2195
01:28:08,279 --> 01:28:12,899
um Nexus of action I mean the the

2196
01:28:10,219 --> 01:28:14,939
antidepressants are it's a very broad

2197
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:17,519
feel

2198
01:28:14,939 --> 01:28:20,638
um so we could think about maybe

2199
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:22,760
um like fluoxetine or Prozac

2200
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,760
um

2201
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,980
and and you know some of these have like

2202
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:32,399
that one I like to talk about because

2203
01:28:28,979 --> 01:28:34,500
again it has no known drug interactions

2204
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:37,679
according to to information available

2205
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:39,359
but it can have overlapping

2206
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:43,380
um side effects so that would be more in

2207
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:46,439
the pharmaco dynamic area with some of

2208
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:48,420
these antidepressants I'd have to dig in

2209
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:50,460
a little bit deeper on some of the

2210
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:52,920
mechanisms of actions

2211
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:54,840
with those Pharmaceuticals

2212
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,880
um fair enough let's talk about in use

2213
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,500
then right so so maybe maybe I caught

2214
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:02,400
you off guard with the actual uh

2215
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:04,619
pharmacodynamics but if you are taking

2216
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:07,079
um you know one of these ssris would

2217
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:09,300
these would the side effects that you

2218
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:12,559
would want to be cautious of when taking

2219
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:14,699
cannabis the same ones as the

2220
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:17,940
benzodiazepams are we are we with the

2221
01:29:14,698 --> 01:29:19,399
ssris are we still talking about

2222
01:29:17,939 --> 01:29:23,519
um

2223
01:29:19,399 --> 01:29:26,158
uh like loss of dexterity and and you

2224
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,840
know sedation and difficulty driving

2225
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:30,238
cars or or are we talking about

2226
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:33,199
something you know potentially more

2227
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:35,759
serious like uh you know

2228
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:38,158
Serotonin poisoning or something I don't

2229
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,920
know I'm just I'm just guessing right so

2230
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:43,979
you might I think you might experience

2231
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:47,039
um like you know so some of the ssris

2232
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:50,178
specifically right um Citalopram I think

2233
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:53,819
is a pretty popular one it's extensively

2234
01:29:50,179 --> 01:29:56,520
metabolized by sip 2c19 one of the

2235
01:29:53,819 --> 01:29:58,019
alphabet soup things I mentioned in the

2236
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,780
beginning of this thing which is one of

2237
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:03,960
the major enzymes that metabolize

2238
01:30:00,779 --> 01:30:07,079
cannabinoids and so you could run the

2239
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:09,179
risk of having cannabinoids be a victim

2240
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:12,179
of an interaction which could make them

2241
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:15,359
more or less effective make them more

2242
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:17,699
likely to have an unwanted effect

2243
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:19,619
um again just going back to that analogy

2244
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:21,599
of the guy strutting around town with

2245
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:23,340
nothing to do might walk down the down

2246
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,539
street or just you know it's okay to sit

2247
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:27,000
in the middle of the street when it's

2248
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:29,279
not busy and do your work that you need

2249
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,100
to do but it can get more dangerous the

2250
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:35,099
longer you sit there so again just to

2251
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:36,840
try and Cobble together an analogy

2252
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:39,539
um so I think with the some of those

2253
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,639
ssris you might be thinking it could be

2254
01:30:39,539 --> 01:30:42,479
go either way victim or perpetrator and

2255
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:45,000
this is

2256
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:46,859
you know kind of at the limit I think of

2257
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,380
a lot of information out there um if

2258
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:51,779
even if you go you know I worked with a

2259
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:54,000
with Penn State they have a cannabis

2260
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:55,679
Research Center there and and been

2261
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,238
advising and participating with their

2262
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,139
Center and they put up

2263
01:30:57,238 --> 01:31:01,198
um

2264
01:30:58,139 --> 01:31:03,239
uh like a like a little database where

2265
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:05,939
you can put in cannabinoids and look up

2266
01:31:03,238 --> 01:31:07,678
a potential drug drug interactions and

2267
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:09,238
you know it's it's like I think of it

2268
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:12,000
like this like they've made the beach

2269
01:31:09,238 --> 01:31:14,218
and a little bit of Shoreline

2270
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,380
and you can wade into the water and

2271
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:18,899
explore what's there but if you want to

2272
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:21,539
go any deeper and like see dolphins and

2273
01:31:18,899 --> 01:31:23,519
you know the shipwrecks and things that

2274
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:26,279
we're not there yet with being able to

2275
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:30,239
go to that level of exploration

2276
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:32,639
but we do know that ssris and

2277
01:31:30,238 --> 01:31:36,658
cannabinoids do share common routes of

2278
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:38,880
metabolism and that could be something

2279
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:41,399
to think about

2280
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:44,119
um you know because not every SSRI goes

2281
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:48,658
through the the same

2282
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:50,340
sip but a lot of them do all right the

2283
01:31:48,658 --> 01:31:52,439
the last

2284
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:53,520
um medicine category I want to I want to

2285
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:55,319
touch on

2286
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,780
um it may be a specialty that you may or

2287
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:59,039
may not like you know overlap with but

2288
01:31:57,779 --> 01:32:00,899
but what about

2289
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:02,519
um uh children children's medicines

2290
01:32:00,899 --> 01:32:05,460
right because

2291
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:08,760
um you know the fact that uh children

2292
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:11,579
who have got you know a range of issues

2293
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:14,400
you know very very easily pointing at

2294
01:32:11,579 --> 01:32:17,158
like immunocompromised type kids like

2295
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:19,198
they have literally been the poster

2296
01:32:17,158 --> 01:32:21,779
children for cannabis medicine and

2297
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:24,238
helping to expand it you know over the

2298
01:32:21,779 --> 01:32:25,979
last 20 years because

2299
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:29,119
um you know the way that cannabis

2300
01:32:25,979 --> 01:32:31,259
medicine and helps kids uh it it it

2301
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:32,880
pulls at your heartstrings and people

2302
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:34,739
are like yes these kids should be able

2303
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,659
to be using cannabis oil for their

2304
01:32:34,738 --> 01:32:38,698
seizures and and let's get this law

2305
01:32:36,658 --> 01:32:40,198
passed right and so

2306
01:32:38,698 --> 01:32:43,198
um uh would you have anything to add

2307
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:45,059
about interaction between

2308
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:47,279
um cannabinoids which might be coming

2309
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:49,620
from a parent who is feeling desperate

2310
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:51,658
and other Pharmaceuticals that they

2311
01:32:49,619 --> 01:32:53,639
might already be on and just to be

2312
01:32:51,658 --> 01:32:56,460
reiterate we are not giving medical

2313
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:58,139
advice all we're doing is pointing out

2314
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:01,020
things for

2315
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:03,659
um caregivers to stay aware of

2316
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:06,900
I am so glad that we're talking about

2317
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:10,319
this because so often when we talk about

2318
01:33:06,899 --> 01:33:12,599
healthy normal adult Volunteers in a

2319
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:15,479
research study we extrapolate that to

2320
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:18,780
the entire population and in the absence

2321
01:33:15,479 --> 01:33:20,759
of pediatric drug drug

2322
01:33:18,779 --> 01:33:24,359
information

2323
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:26,400
adult information is used however there

2324
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:29,039
are subtle differences in development

2325
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:30,899
and all sorts of things between children

2326
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:32,880
and adults I mean just look at the

2327
01:33:30,899 --> 01:33:34,799
differences between a two-year-old and

2328
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:38,219
an eight-year-old and a 15 year old

2329
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:41,039
right there there's a huge you know and

2330
01:33:38,219 --> 01:33:43,439
so the magnitude of a drug drug

2331
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:45,019
interaction in a pediatric patient

2332
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:48,299
population

2333
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:51,060
May differ from adults because of

2334
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:53,880
age-dependent changes puberty and

2335
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:56,580
prepubescent for example can change the

2336
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:58,739
drug disposition or response

2337
01:33:56,579 --> 01:34:02,698
um you know in some of the early studies

2338
01:33:58,738 --> 01:34:05,158
with uh THC compounds and pediatric

2339
01:34:02,698 --> 01:34:06,899
populations like by the late rafaelum

2340
01:34:05,158 --> 01:34:08,039
you know they didn't really see what

2341
01:34:06,899 --> 01:34:10,799
they thought what they would see in

2342
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:12,719
adults given that compound and you know

2343
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,100
the brains are still in a high state of

2344
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,899
development and so

2345
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:19,860
you know there may not be the same

2346
01:34:15,899 --> 01:34:21,479
response to THC or other cannabinoids

2347
01:34:19,859 --> 01:34:25,099
and there could be other factors dose

2348
01:34:21,479 --> 01:34:27,359
formulation the disease State body mass

2349
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:30,120
things like that

2350
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:33,179
and I'll say again that the it needs to

2351
01:34:30,119 --> 01:34:35,279
be assessed in children separately from

2352
01:34:33,179 --> 01:34:37,980
adults and and this is a challenging

2353
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:41,340
thing but careful consideration you need

2354
01:34:37,979 --> 01:34:42,599
to account for age-dependent changes and

2355
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:44,219
you have to build a little more

2356
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:47,039
confidence

2357
01:34:44,219 --> 01:34:48,079
um about that but it is absolutely a

2358
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:52,139
concern

2359
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:54,960
and it may you know these again these

2360
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:56,819
ddis are routinely performed in healthy

2361
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:58,560
adult Volunteers in early clinical

2362
01:34:56,819 --> 01:35:00,359
studies but

2363
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:04,380
you know it's there's a lot of ethical

2364
01:35:00,359 --> 01:35:05,880
logistical and Method challenges to you

2365
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:09,480
know doing these types of study in

2366
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:10,859
pediatric patients I mean you know uh I

2367
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:13,439
don't know if you've ever tried to get

2368
01:35:10,859 --> 01:35:16,198
like a four-year-old to fill out a a

2369
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:18,719
form or a survey

2370
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:21,238
might be a little tricky

2371
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:24,060
um adults can can do that thing just

2372
01:35:21,238 --> 01:35:27,839
fine so I think there's a whole range of

2373
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:30,960
it but you know pediatric patients in

2374
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:34,319
the hospital often receive multiple

2375
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:36,539
drugs and so there are efforts to

2376
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:39,479
characterize

2377
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:41,698
um those things I like this phrase that

2378
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:43,138
you've got age-dependent changes and I

2379
01:35:41,698 --> 01:35:45,719
know that you were talking about kids

2380
01:35:43,139 --> 01:35:49,079
but that definitely applies to adults

2381
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:50,219
too because I know that um the effects

2382
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:54,300
that

2383
01:35:50,219 --> 01:35:56,100
um you know uh my my plant-based drugs

2384
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:58,020
and fungus-based drugs and my

2385
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:00,719
pharmaceutical based drugs they have all

2386
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:02,400
changed as I've gotten older and my

2387
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:05,039
reaction to it you know I was kind of

2388
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:07,259
impervious in my 20s and now you know

2389
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:08,880
I'm a little more aware because it's a

2390
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:10,860
you know it's easier to knock me out of

2391
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,319
balance but I like that phrase age

2392
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:15,779
dependent changes

2393
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:17,639
um so that could give one solid example

2394
01:36:15,779 --> 01:36:20,099
all right this is across the board

2395
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:22,139
example cannabis is not special I'm just

2396
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:25,440
going to say across the board

2397
01:36:22,139 --> 01:36:29,000
anytime there's a I think morphine and

2398
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:31,939
opioids Fentanyl combined with anything

2399
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:35,520
in a clinical setting

2400
01:36:31,939 --> 01:36:38,219
can have effects on respiratory

2401
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:39,260
depression and so that is something I

2402
01:36:38,219 --> 01:36:42,119
think especially when we talk about

2403
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:44,820
chronic diseases hospitalization

2404
01:36:42,119 --> 01:36:47,340
outpatient stuff you know just because

2405
01:36:44,819 --> 01:36:52,340
in adult populations we're observing

2406
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:54,360
this phenomenon of decreased opioid

2407
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:56,819
overdoses and deaths and adult

2408
01:36:54,359 --> 01:36:59,158
populations again this is a thing we

2409
01:36:56,819 --> 01:37:02,579
talk about age dependence right it may

2410
01:36:59,158 --> 01:37:04,559
not be quite as clear-cut in pediatric

2411
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:06,600
population so I just want to throw that

2412
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,620
out there is like

2413
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,020
um you know

2414
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:11,698
you can you can look this up uh don't

2415
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:13,620
take my word for it do some of your own

2416
01:37:11,698 --> 01:37:15,719
research but again you can find a lot of

2417
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:18,300
information about wow these are the

2418
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:20,279
potential most difficult areas right on

2419
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,539
so I've got two more questions before we

2420
01:37:20,279 --> 01:37:23,759
wrap up here

2421
01:37:21,539 --> 01:37:28,139
um I know that uh you know it was our

2422
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:30,539
goal today to not answer every potential

2423
01:37:28,139 --> 01:37:32,400
question that could be answered asked

2424
01:37:30,539 --> 01:37:34,319
about this because there's it's just too

2425
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:36,259
complex we would need 20 more minutes

2426
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:39,840
yeah

2427
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:43,199
but but our goal was to help give give

2428
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:46,980
patients and caregivers a um a a

2429
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:49,799
perspective of how to suss out their

2430
01:37:46,979 --> 01:37:52,979
Solutions and their unique situation and

2431
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:54,600
so I wanna I wanna kind of like uh you

2432
01:37:52,979 --> 01:37:57,718
know kind of like throw you this this

2433
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:59,280
kind of umbrella question for you to to

2434
01:37:57,719 --> 01:38:01,319
answer here

2435
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:03,539
um in what Manner would you recommend

2436
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:06,179
patients and caregivers go about their

2437
01:38:03,539 --> 01:38:09,060
own research to discover if they may be

2438
01:38:06,179 --> 01:38:11,279
having you know air interactions between

2439
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:13,260
their Pharma and their cannabis very

2440
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:14,399
specifically let's say that either you

2441
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:16,199
know you're the patient or you're the

2442
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:18,119
caregiver and you're like you know what

2443
01:38:16,198 --> 01:38:20,279
I think I think that might be what we're

2444
01:38:18,119 --> 01:38:21,899
seeing what would you say is their first

2445
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:24,319
and their second step to try to suss

2446
01:38:21,899 --> 01:38:24,319
that out

2447
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:29,159
keep

2448
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:30,359
meticulous records

2449
01:38:29,158 --> 01:38:33,059
um you know and that doesn't have to

2450
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:36,179
mean you're journaling all day it just

2451
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:39,780
means that you are a bit Vigilant about

2452
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:42,899
that you're controlling your inputs

2453
01:38:39,779 --> 01:38:45,719
um so you know if you're like oh I went

2454
01:38:42,899 --> 01:38:47,759
to brunch and and drank four mimosas and

2455
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:49,500
then I took my medicine and then later

2456
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:52,079
that night I smoked cannabis and boy did

2457
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:54,238
I feel funny I must have had a drug drug

2458
01:38:52,079 --> 01:38:55,979
interaction with cannabis and those um

2459
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:57,119
you know my prescription meds well it

2460
01:38:55,979 --> 01:38:59,819
could be the alcohol could be other

2461
01:38:57,119 --> 01:39:01,619
things so and it could be Diet also

2462
01:38:59,819 --> 01:39:04,259
plays a role so I think

2463
01:39:01,619 --> 01:39:07,039
first thing to do get a journal find the

2464
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:09,659
criteria find some baseline things

2465
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:11,100
there's no shortage I think of like

2466
01:39:09,658 --> 01:39:13,799
questionnaires who could even draw

2467
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:16,079
smiley faces like do I feel frowny-faced

2468
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:19,739
today do I feel Flatline smile today um

2469
01:39:16,079 --> 01:39:22,439
that's a people use those types of

2470
01:39:19,738 --> 01:39:24,178
charts and things like that um different

2471
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:27,599
scales so find your scales find your

2472
01:39:24,179 --> 01:39:28,319
measurements but again I think

2473
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,380
um

2474
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:34,319
uh keeping track of what you you know I

2475
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:35,760
have talked to patients and caregivers

2476
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:37,198
in the past and sometimes I say hey if

2477
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,840
you have a label on a product take a

2478
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:41,039
picture keep a digital Journal if you

2479
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,960
want to do it it's almost like a

2480
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:44,819
scrapbook you have a journal you can

2481
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:46,079
peel off the product label put it in

2482
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:48,359
your journal or write down the

2483
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:50,460
information from it and keep track of

2484
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:53,579
what you're taking when you're taking it

2485
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:55,319
and when you're taking other things and

2486
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:57,059
this is even a strategy that's used for

2487
01:39:55,319 --> 01:39:59,399
pharmaceutical drugs so doctors will be

2488
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:01,440
like okay well you're taking drug X I'm

2489
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:03,059
going to prescribe you drug why

2490
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:04,979
if you take them both in the morning and

2491
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:06,900
you feel X or Y

2492
01:40:04,979 --> 01:40:08,638
'all then then take this drug two hours

2493
01:40:06,899 --> 01:40:10,920
later take it four hours later take it

2494
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:13,560
six hours later and so start by taking

2495
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:15,658
if you're new to this

2496
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:17,460
everything you know this is based on

2497
01:40:15,658 --> 01:40:20,460
literature that's out there Russo and

2498
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:23,100
McCallum have a great paper on dosing

2499
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:25,079
strategies and

2500
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:27,960
you know taking things at night and low

2501
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:30,359
amounts if that's okay feels all right

2502
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:32,460
you don't feel the ddis you can you know

2503
01:40:30,359 --> 01:40:34,738
start to play with the timing and the

2504
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:36,960
dosing and finding that range where

2505
01:40:34,738 --> 01:40:39,718
you're not getting adverse effects but

2506
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,819
again if you don't feel good

2507
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:44,520
um you know it's it's not great if you

2508
01:40:41,819 --> 01:40:46,500
get if you get like all the side effects

2509
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:49,679
of cannabis like oh man I feel sedated I

2510
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:52,139
feel hungry my mouth is dry I feel dizzy

2511
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:54,119
and I can't remember anything you know

2512
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:55,800
that's like a lot of boxes to check and

2513
01:40:54,119 --> 01:40:58,738
you and that may not be what you're

2514
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:02,119
looking for from a product and so again

2515
01:40:58,738 --> 01:41:05,218
I think it has to do with um

2516
01:41:02,119 --> 01:41:08,279
keeping track of the inputs control as

2517
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:10,859
many variables as you can

2518
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:12,359
um and I think you'll start to you'll

2519
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:14,460
find that there's a lot of things to be

2520
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:18,179
like well I've been drinking caffeine

2521
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:19,560
all day and uh or I or I haven't been

2522
01:41:18,179 --> 01:41:22,020
drinking it all day and so I think

2523
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:23,940
finding those baselines

2524
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:25,620
um will help you is there a database

2525
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:27,839
that you recommend more than Google

2526
01:41:25,619 --> 01:41:30,359
because after the patient journals and

2527
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:33,000
they've got some suspicions they're

2528
01:41:30,359 --> 01:41:35,279
probably going to search these drugs and

2529
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,439
cannabis and see what they get and

2530
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:39,859
Google may be our best option and I'm

2531
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:42,599
always a big fan of the project

2532
01:41:39,859 --> 01:41:45,000
cbd.org it conditions section because

2533
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:47,280
that that's always great too but um is

2534
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,880
is Google still our best bet

2535
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:51,779
um I mean until AI takes over

2536
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:56,039
um

2537
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:57,420
you know you know the internet can be

2538
01:41:56,039 --> 01:42:01,079
helpful

2539
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:03,480
and I would look for multiple resources

2540
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:06,658
that corroborate your evidence don't

2541
01:42:03,479 --> 01:42:09,779
just take the computer's word for it

2542
01:42:06,658 --> 01:42:12,839
find a couple references online from

2543
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:15,198
different types of sources maybe the

2544
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:20,279
Mayo Clinic maybe

2545
01:42:15,198 --> 01:42:22,559
pubmed.gov maybe from a webinar where

2546
01:42:20,279 --> 01:42:27,300
there's a doctor talking about stuff

2547
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:29,460
like use use a you know you have to take

2548
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:32,060
on this challenge using all available

2549
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:35,399
resources to do that because things

2550
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:37,080
often just because the same study is

2551
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:39,420
cited over and over and over again

2552
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:41,880
doesn't mean the study itself is

2553
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:45,300
reproducible and the results are

2554
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:47,880
translatable to you and so finding

2555
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:51,239
um you know the information from diverse

2556
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:53,039
sources finding the same thing the same

2557
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:55,500
results from different people running

2558
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:57,600
the studies and different

2559
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:01,738
reputable organizations come to the same

2560
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:04,199
conclusions you know that will help you

2561
01:43:01,738 --> 01:43:06,779
know as they say try and find something

2562
01:43:04,198 --> 01:43:09,899
written something you can watch

2563
01:43:06,779 --> 01:43:13,439
something on someone you can talk to to

2564
01:43:09,899 --> 01:43:16,138
corroborate the evidence and so I think

2565
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:18,719
you know that that is um just kind of

2566
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:22,440
where we're at because Ai and the

2567
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:24,420
internet love to lie to you you know

2568
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:27,719
there's that's the ongoing thing like

2569
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:30,118
wow AI will just make stuff up to make

2570
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:34,618
you happy it knows what you want to hear

2571
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:36,719
or want to read or want to see and we

2572
01:43:34,618 --> 01:43:39,539
have to always be suspicious of

2573
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:41,760
forgetting you know exactly hearing

2574
01:43:39,539 --> 01:43:43,800
exactly what we want to hear

2575
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,300
um you know you're probably about to buy

2576
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:48,840
a used car

2577
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:50,820
so just be be careful out there

2578
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:52,739
um and I think that what I would say is

2579
01:43:50,819 --> 01:43:55,559
try and test things you know if it's

2580
01:43:52,738 --> 01:43:58,019
okay if I believe X let me try and

2581
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:59,820
stretch out X as far as it can go this

2582
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:03,239
line of thinking Until It Breaks where

2583
01:43:59,819 --> 01:44:05,158
is it where is the weakness in this this

2584
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:06,718
rationale whatever it is you're looking

2585
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:09,658
at drug drug interactions there's

2586
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:11,698
significance they're not significance

2587
01:44:09,658 --> 01:44:13,259
so the last question

2588
01:44:11,698 --> 01:44:16,799
um I want to hit on with you our last

2589
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:18,860
two minutes here is uh I want to uh go

2590
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:21,480
back to and plug the

2591
01:44:18,859 --> 01:44:23,158
budsinfo.com project you and I have

2592
01:44:21,479 --> 01:44:26,218
talked about that

2593
01:44:23,158 --> 01:44:28,259
um you know uh before we started and uh

2594
01:44:26,219 --> 01:44:31,439
you know the the listeners of shaping

2595
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:33,360
fire knows that we support

2596
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:35,460
um cannabis research and we are always

2597
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:37,019
trying to plug

2598
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:39,000
um uh research that we know where is

2599
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:41,400
going on we participated in you know

2600
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,920
Ethan Russo's you know CBD and CBG

2601
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:45,179
projects before sending people their way

2602
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,800
and

2603
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:49,920
um you know you've told me about the the

2604
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,480
good folks behind uh budsinfo.com and

2605
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:54,239
and I looked it up and it looks like

2606
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:56,339
something legitimate so so my question

2607
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:59,039
for you is is what does the research

2608
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:00,539
look like to unearth these interactions

2609
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:03,479
that you and I have been discussing

2610
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:04,859
today and you know

2611
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:06,899
um

2612
01:45:04,859 --> 01:45:09,179
what kind of research is happening what

2613
01:45:06,899 --> 01:45:12,238
does that look like and then give me a

2614
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:13,560
brief plug for budsinfo.com and then

2615
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:15,359
we'll wrap up

2616
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:18,840
sure so

2617
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:20,460
you know my exploration and research has

2618
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:24,199
been you know a lot of frustration with

2619
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:26,039
getting funding and grants and you know

2620
01:45:24,198 --> 01:45:28,379
in some ways you know you're always

2621
01:45:26,039 --> 01:45:30,899
waiting on grants and and maybe private

2622
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:32,819
funding from the industry and stuff and

2623
01:45:30,899 --> 01:45:34,319
as time has gone on I found more and

2624
01:45:32,819 --> 01:45:36,599
more ways Robert said you know what this

2625
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:38,639
summer I'm just gonna do the dang

2626
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,800
research and I'm not going to wait for

2627
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:42,480
funding I'm gonna bootstrap this you

2628
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,239
know I believe in it I'm going to invest

2629
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:48,839
in it and there's so many databases out

2630
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:51,299
there there's so much you can find at

2631
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:53,639
the tips of your fingers if you're just

2632
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:57,300
willing to spend time doing it and and

2633
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:59,400
and so unearthing the research for me

2634
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:02,039
you know

2635
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:03,960
um doing case reports contacting

2636
01:46:02,039 --> 01:46:05,219
clinicians and starting to unearth these

2637
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:07,079
things where they have these patient

2638
01:46:05,219 --> 01:46:08,219
files no one they're busy clinicians

2639
01:46:07,079 --> 01:46:10,738
they don't have time to go through them

2640
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:12,960
some of most of it's like you know not

2641
01:46:10,738 --> 01:46:15,718
it's like I can't read this this is not

2642
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:17,939
like the best of it you find nuggets you

2643
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:19,739
find signals you know it's like it's

2644
01:46:17,939 --> 01:46:22,439
like searching for extraterrestrial life

2645
01:46:19,738 --> 01:46:25,439
and suddenly you hear an alien TV show

2646
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:27,719
and you're like what is going on here

2647
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:30,799
and you're like I picked up a signal you

2648
01:46:27,719 --> 01:46:32,939
know um and I have to say

2649
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:35,340
digging through we had a paper come out

2650
01:46:32,939 --> 01:46:38,219
recently about Delta 8 THC derived from

2651
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:40,679
hemp and we comb through um you know the

2652
01:46:38,219 --> 01:46:42,539
lead epidemiologist

2653
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:44,460
um on the paper

2654
01:46:42,539 --> 01:46:46,380
you know brought this to our attention

2655
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:48,719
hey there's this database we can access

2656
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:50,460
it we can run these queries we've got a

2657
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:53,340
whole team together to go through the

2658
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:56,399
data and it's really exciting because

2659
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:59,579
you know this is data that's people are

2660
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:01,939
reporting to the FDA to poison control

2661
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:05,118
centers and it's just floating around

2662
01:47:01,939 --> 01:47:08,099
nobody wants to comb through it and and

2663
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:11,339
I we requested more and more information

2664
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:14,639
they sent us case reports Hospital files

2665
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:17,400
you know the products uh scanned and

2666
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:19,440
pictures of the products along with the

2667
01:47:17,399 --> 01:47:21,059
reports from the patients and why they

2668
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:21,960
showed up to the ER what they were

2669
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,060
feeling

2670
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:25,859
and we came to realize that one the

2671
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:27,780
classification system for all these

2672
01:47:25,859 --> 01:47:29,460
things are entering the databases not

2673
01:47:27,779 --> 01:47:32,579
useful I'll give you an example uh

2674
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:35,039
psilocybin has a an e at the end of it

2675
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:38,039
in the FDA database so if you search

2676
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:40,939
psilocybin you will find nothing but if

2677
01:47:38,039 --> 01:47:44,519
you search psilocybin you will

2678
01:47:40,939 --> 01:47:46,198
so if you if you look up uh cannabinoid

2679
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:48,300
you may not find anything if you look up

2680
01:47:46,198 --> 01:47:50,819
you know you you know so think about

2681
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:52,260
Delta 9 THC is it plus minus version or

2682
01:47:50,819 --> 01:47:53,698
the minus minus version like what

2683
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:55,739
version is it

2684
01:47:53,698 --> 01:47:58,198
um so there are some issues around there

2685
01:47:55,738 --> 01:47:59,279
so it takes a bit of knowing what you're

2686
01:47:58,198 --> 01:48:01,500
looking for

2687
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:02,639
but that led us to create Bud's info

2688
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:05,639
we're like you know there's an explosion

2689
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,960
of product diversity here and you know

2690
01:48:05,639 --> 01:48:08,279
as a colleague told me where are the

2691
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,899
guard rails

2692
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:12,719
and

2693
01:48:09,899 --> 01:48:15,599
um and so we we decided to bootstrap

2694
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:18,600
this so budsinfo.com please check it out

2695
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:21,739
please scan it we are trying to use this

2696
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:25,139
to centralize the collection of data

2697
01:48:21,738 --> 01:48:28,019
standardize the data right now if there

2698
01:48:25,139 --> 01:48:30,480
is an issue with a cannabis product hemp

2699
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:32,159
product and a vulnerable population it

2700
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:36,059
goes to local

2701
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:39,779
state or city centers and eventually

2702
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:41,580
makes it or not at all to a central

2703
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:44,939
database

2704
01:48:41,579 --> 01:48:47,340
so we may not we may never some of this

2705
01:48:44,939 --> 01:48:49,198
stuff will be quite late to the game to

2706
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:50,880
uncover so it's been very I have to say

2707
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:53,158
it's been very exciting

2708
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:56,039
to be sort of on this Forefront of

2709
01:48:53,158 --> 01:48:59,219
Public Health where we're finding

2710
01:48:56,039 --> 01:49:00,658
signals and very specific once

2711
01:48:59,219 --> 01:49:02,760
um you know

2712
01:49:00,658 --> 01:49:04,979
you know as you would expect there are

2713
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:07,260
not a lot of Adverse Events for whole

2714
01:49:04,979 --> 01:49:09,899
plant cannabis compared to other

2715
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:12,360
products oddly enough there's not a lot

2716
01:49:09,899 --> 01:49:13,679
of Adverse Events being reported yet for

2717
01:49:12,359 --> 01:49:15,899
psychedelics but it might be again

2718
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:18,239
because people can't find psilocybin in

2719
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:18,960
the database to report it

2720
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:21,899
um

2721
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:24,899
so there are a lot of interesting issues

2722
01:49:21,899 --> 01:49:26,939
where we've been comparing and trying to

2723
01:49:24,899 --> 01:49:28,920
figure out are we using the right

2724
01:49:26,939 --> 01:49:30,479
metrics to detect these signals and

2725
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:32,219
again it's not about saying cannabis is

2726
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:34,559
good or bad it's about we want

2727
01:49:32,219 --> 01:49:36,719
everyone's ship to reach a Safe Harbor

2728
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,340
and we want to know where that big rock

2729
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:40,800
is in the harbor so you don't run

2730
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:43,380
aground and and right on right yeah

2731
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:45,179
let's bring this on home there Jehan so

2732
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:48,420
so what you want to do dear listener is

2733
01:49:45,179 --> 01:49:52,020
go to budsinfo.com there is a short form

2734
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:54,779
there for you it is very easy to fill

2735
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:58,020
out and the questions are about if

2736
01:49:54,779 --> 01:50:01,319
you've ever had adverse experiences with

2737
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:03,179
cannabis and for you to describe that

2738
01:50:01,319 --> 01:50:06,539
um I went ahead and filled one out it

2739
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:08,880
took me like like four minutes tops and

2740
01:50:06,539 --> 01:50:10,500
uh and Jay Hunter they're all Anonymous

2741
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,618
right so they're not going into like

2742
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:14,819
some tagged database or anything right

2743
01:50:12,618 --> 01:50:16,920
absolutely not it is completely

2744
01:50:14,819 --> 01:50:18,960
Anonymous we're doing this in full

2745
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:21,118
compliance so that we don't need an iron

2746
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:23,399
B board so now the great thing about

2747
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:24,539
research is learning how to be like when

2748
01:50:23,399 --> 01:50:26,759
you need certain things and when you

2749
01:50:24,539 --> 01:50:29,238
don't so it's totally anonymized this

2750
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:32,760
was started by students it's largely run

2751
01:50:29,238 --> 01:50:35,579
by students and we are trying to perfect

2752
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:38,760
this and we think that versus trying to

2753
01:50:35,579 --> 01:50:41,399
find the medform watch

2754
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:44,100
um or a poison control center form I

2755
01:50:41,399 --> 01:50:45,420
think we have figured out the as you

2756
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:48,119
just said it takes four minutes to fill

2757
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:50,940
out and it's easy and again

2758
01:50:48,118 --> 01:50:53,039
what will help federally regulate and

2759
01:50:50,939 --> 01:50:56,399
federally legalized cannabis is knowing

2760
01:50:53,039 --> 01:50:58,260
the risks and and I I strongly believe

2761
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:00,599
that that if we can clearly communicate

2762
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:02,699
that we know what the risks are and

2763
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:05,280
we're continuing to our commitment to

2764
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:08,039
track what those might be that I don't

2765
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:10,319
think anything will stand in the way of

2766
01:51:08,039 --> 01:51:13,500
complete legalization and regulation of

2767
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:16,319
cannabis fantastic well uh Jan thank you

2768
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:19,380
so much for joining us today on shaping

2769
01:51:16,319 --> 01:51:22,920
fire again after all of this time uh you

2770
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:26,340
know this is an incredibly complex area

2771
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:29,460
of work and I am grateful that you are

2772
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:31,980
you know dedicating your expertise to it

2773
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:35,279
among some of your your other areas you

2774
01:51:31,979 --> 01:51:37,919
love because we really do need to get to

2775
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:41,579
the bottom of this not only for you know

2776
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:44,639
patient care but also so that we can get

2777
01:51:41,579 --> 01:51:46,439
you know normalization to have be more

2778
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:49,020
grounded and have its feet under itself

2779
01:51:46,439 --> 01:51:52,259
better because you know we we are we are

2780
