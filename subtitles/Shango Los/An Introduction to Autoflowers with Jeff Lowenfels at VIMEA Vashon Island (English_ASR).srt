[Music]

00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:58,049
Chino which is the program I use just

31
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:00,209
came out with that new things you tell

32
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,189
me what I could do in our behalf

33
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm gonna call this talk there's a new

34
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:07,979
bun in town autoflowering cannabis you

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,439
are the wrong group to give this talk to

36
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,329
for two reasons one is the first time

37
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,289
I've ever been given it except for my

38
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,290
wife who's sitting over there

39
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:30,669
[Applause]

40
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,990
so we're gonna go good I do have these

41
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,409
three books out there's no question like

42
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,700
I wrote these three books you know

43
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:49,049
trilogies was noted so I called myself

44
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:50,789
Lorde of the roots but you know really I

45
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,400
used to be a lawyer I was an assistant

46
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:55,139
attorney general back when they decided

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,849
that Canada should be legal in the

48
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:59,699
privacy of your home in the original ask

49
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:03,780
in the last in 1975 and helped with the

50
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:07,439
definition of privacy and then I became

51
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:12,740
a corporate type and I was actually I

52
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,740
was actually president of a fortune 500

53
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,680
you know the one thing they still do is

54
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:35,810
I write discarding calm it's actually

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,009
the newspaper has changed its name back

56
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,389
to where I was what my person it's

57
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,490
called the Anchorage Daily News and

58
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:45,669
writing the starter column every single

59
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:48,769
week for 40 I think it's now 44 years

60
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:51,800
picture in the paper and insist he's not

61
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:56,329
there two weeks and that to me said rob

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,879
this house he's not home so I store

63
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,990
everything and of course the years even

64
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,969
though we have that that wonderful

65
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,470
opinion and the Supreme Court say he was

66
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,530
leaving the privacy zone I would tell

67
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:18,580
people right about tomatoes I'm really

68
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:21,109
writing about cannabis and legal and so

69
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:22,969
2016 I wrote the first gun comma think

70
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,550
in the United States of America about

71
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,500
cannabis and then I answered my question

72
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,730
by of course talking about cannabis

73
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,439
certainly there are a lot of people the

74
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,439
newspaper readership the word

75
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:58,410
in kanji Keys division canvases so I got

76
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,330
an invitation you know to my design

77
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,270
midway through and to give the very

78
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:05,099
first talk they ever have anything

79
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:07,529
having to do with chemicals the first

80
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,600
time ever they rejected flux 40

81
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,579
Samantha's books someone I understand I

82
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,350
mean would you check them you know but

83
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,959
all of a sudden it's now full of ghosts

84
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,610
coming together talking and so I stole

85
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,159
that little letter I don't accept the

86
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,449
next tomato when I was my way to talk to

87
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,850
the professional garden traders of

88
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,430
America they need TV and radio and

89
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,400
webpages much up and I'm still showing

90
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:42,240
that a why I feel like canvas was gonna

91
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:45,929
be the best tomato and of course you

92
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,610
know this is me know in so many states

93
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,829
and it will be legal in all of the

94
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,160
states and probably within the next

95
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:54,990
couple years and all sorts of

96
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,480
opportunities for garden writers to

97
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,629
write about this thing this is a hottest

98
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,870
topic out there the planter I mean its

99
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,870
toll

100
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,789
[Music]

101
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,570
it's the wrong plant in the United

102
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,509
States and maybe the world so you know

103
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,500
you take any survey every gardener ruins

104
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:41,569
tomatoes

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:52,810
you know why well there are a lot of

106
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:52,810
different choices so easy to grow in

107
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:20,560
let's see here with your father you know

108
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:49,429
next tomato

109
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,710
well again so many choices unbelievable

110
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,429
numbers of choices and getting more all

111
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,960
the time

112
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:59,079
it grows extremely easily going anywhere

113
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,650
that's what they call weekend black

114
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:07,610
enjoyable fruits the constant

115
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:10,120
improvement in researching and let's see

116
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,120
what else we got

117
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:46,528
that's the story he was talking

118
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:49,429
everything else you know but there was

119
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:52,740
just something holding back the

120
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:54,899
enthusiasm of the crowd something holds

121
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,350
back of cannabis from being the next

122
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,970
tomato you know part of it is the

123
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,649
legality situation although I think

124
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,660
that's going way I know that's the only

125
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,929
way and then not only one reason is

126
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:09,028
these plants can take I mean really big

127
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:11,969
and most people don't have big gardens

128
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:13,980
you know there's 40 and they just don't

129
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,290
have big guards even the indica which is

130
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,740
the smaller version that a too big for a

131
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:18,740
garden

132
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,220
you know crazy

133
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,070
and this person's that photo period

134
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,230
problem now if you live in a place like

135
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,680
Anchorage Alaska to understand the

136
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:42,050
formal period of no.14 business and so

137
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,750
cannabis has a real problem you started

138
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:47,539
and then you grow it and you grow it it

139
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,909
can't set flowers until you get 12 hours

140
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:51,289
of darkness and then you gotta forward

141
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:53,000
you know maybe a couple of you know

142
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:54,439
there it is right there and then you

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,600
gotta grow it a couple of warm let's

144
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,000
make even more months if it's got a lot

145
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,159
of that afghani you know history in it

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,129
oh honey can't you grow all the way into

147
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:07,069
the next year flowers still aren't ready

148
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:09,110
so that's a big problem that means you

149
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,690
got to grow indoors if you live in it in

150
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,930
the area we don't get twelve hours of

151
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,660
darkness before the frost comes Mike

152
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:23,479
Anchorage Alaska Oh like most places

153
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:25,309
you're smart people live indoors and

154
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,420
that's you know problems that do know

155
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:31,839
themselves oh okay just a big P have one

156
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:31,839
of these things

157
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:52,290
all right do the sunrise school I want

158
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,240
one of these in the worst way works

159
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:58,588
I want the franchise for this maples

160
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,810
Alaska in the worst way those you know

161
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:02,730
cannabis is not the next tomato if you

162
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:05,518
live in the equator there's someplace

163
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:22,339
really warm like Florida yeah okay you

164
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:24,480
know I would suggest this you know wait

165
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:28,139
wait wait wait wait

166
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,829
there's a type of cannabis which makes

167
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,570
cannabis the next garden tomato you know

168
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:35,219
so we got sativa and indica which

169
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,680
everybody knows about and then we've got

170
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,509
the Atlas right there's a lot of people

171
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,229
I'm surprised a lot of people don't know

172
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:45,208
about it and I'm done man how many

173
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,709
commercial growers have no idea that

174
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:49,768
there's such a thing as a normal flower

175
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:52,500
plant so cannabis ruderalis was

176
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:56,519
discovered in 1924 at least it was

177
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,110
important to spend in 1924 and a Russian

178
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,899
guy he was studying around the Volga

179
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,509
River and discovering this little teeny

180
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,549
plant whoa what is this

181
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:07,019
it's definitely can't miss you know we

182
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:08,729
argue about whether there are three

183
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,220
varieties and what nothing but the thing

184
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:14,730
about this plant was he found it growing

185
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,769
in some crappy soil it was definitely a

186
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,060
cannabis plant and when he tried to

187
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,889
smoke it it was lousy

188
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,750
I don't know good enough but it didn't

189
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,338
have any food at sea ended and so you

190
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,909
know it's on it sort of fell by the

191
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,069
wayside

192
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:27,419
these are the three species these are

193
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:28,659
the sizes of them

194
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,269
[Music]

195
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:33,250
or you know is always to please always

196
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,329
described as being a big fat leaf plant

197
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,710
for the fact every time you see a

198
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,590
picture of it they've got these little

199
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:41,160
skinny leaves pretty kind of cool a

200
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:46,990
complaint and then you about this stuff

201
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:49,929
is that it's fast it goes fast it's

202
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,330
because it started growing in places

203
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:54,099
where the winter came quicker and if it

204
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,230
didn't grow fast and get the flowering

205
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:01,500
stage and seed stage intake you survived

206
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:05,080
and so the only ones to survive okay

207
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,409
best and no falling period that was the

208
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:12,220
other thing no photo period this Vista

209
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:16,000
blooms based upon genes not based upon

210
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,879
full holy crow you know this is kind of

211
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,440
revolutionary and people people got kind

212
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,169
of excited about it where they come from

213
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,790
well these these come from plantations

214
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:28,990
hemp plantations from around the world

215
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:31,659
they now discovered cameras in places

216
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,970
Mexico all over the place any place

217
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:36,219
where there's a hand farm you know there

218
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,040
would be two escaped plants and of

219
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,810
course this is why people grow hemp

220
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,779
that's the fiber and of course prefers

221
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:45,609
made in the cloth and it was very

222
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:48,519
absolutely keep for sales was absolutely

223
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,320
keep rope for sailing so there you go

224
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,230
conquer people they love song a very

225
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,330
very important stuff and I love this

226
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:59,889
story they discovered that if you take

227
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:04,590
three cannabis ropes and eighteen people

228
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,590
you can move these things all the

229
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,760
heating growing he and his slaves brew

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,950
than him but he paid his taxes with him

231
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,049
it was a rascally guy not only me to

232
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,450
grow cannabis this is one of the places

233
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:25,149
he surveyed in Virginia's Natural Bridge

234
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,129
and if you look very closely around that

235
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:29,029
bridge you see the George Washington

236
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:36,470
inscribed his knee

237
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:47,720
meteors Lincoln it says you know I can't

238
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:50,240
really track that down but I got out and

239
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,360
they just did their thing and if this

240
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,039
was in Siberia and the way to keep

241
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,480
really quickly plan a plan so you got

242
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,469
that great devolution everything

243
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,019
check out this Rudy Allen and of course

244
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,879
was very little quality which you know

245
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,769
should indicate the most of us if it's

246
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,210
got low quality you didn't going to be

247
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:11,629
around very long because who wants a low

248
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:14,570
quality plant very weak very weak of any

249
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:15,980
THC you give a good idea and you know

250
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:22,480
the professional growers when they heard

251
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:24,920
about it in Canada and other places

252
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,889
plants to do stuff with them they

253
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,839
laughed because this was just young weed

254
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,799
plant and tell some of them really

255
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,670
really smart

256
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,669
geneticists

257
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,798
[Music]

258
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:49,818
so so they study definitely crazy for me

259
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:52,109
what are we to can teach another reader

260
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:54,000
you know particularly to have absolutely

261
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:58,379
no education that you have a desire in

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,500
me and you know sure enough reading was

263
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:03,600
done and the interesting things happened

264
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,099
so I think I got my timing ran on this

265
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,480
don't hold me to it but I think since

266
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,529
these CDs came out with something called

267
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,699
movie on a skunk

268
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:13,769
now what this was you know it was a

269
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,409
really easy plant to grow

270
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:18,259
he still still had the regular cannabis

271
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:22,020
autoflowering

272
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:25,109
photo period situation that was an

273
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:26,879
interesting plant it went to flower very

274
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:30,089
quickly so that's what they were working

275
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,970
on trying to get the flower quick forget

276
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:34,829
the photo period stuff but yeah it

277
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,569
wasn't very good stuff and you know

278
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:39,329
people so lost interest in do it you

279
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:45,109
tell this guy came along rivers need

280
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:48,119
they'll come to me and bread he bread

281
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:50,519
one of these movie Allen that was given

282
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,589
to him by a guy named Antonio and

283
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:56,429
apparently it was from Mexico the story

284
00:17:52,589 --> 00:18:15,480
goes hey Brett Williams wonder which is

285
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:20,429
she from the wonderful Jeanette and the

286
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:24,390
writer was cute come on nineteen

287
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:26,940
generations to breed and the first one

288
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:31,390
what a cute little teeny plant those but

289
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:34,309
I mean these were really proud and

290
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:37,840
if you sell this boy this was really

291
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,839
something and people

292
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:51,909
[Music]

293
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:06,399
[Music]

294
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:34,779
and so you started out this is you know

295
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:39,159
this is what you started out all the big

296
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:41,139
guys on this on the regular boards and

297
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,240
and anybody who wrote about horrible

298
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,360
flowers you know on grass city in most

299
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,120
places all over it was like it was like

300
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:51,279
before all of the stuff that goes on in

301
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,849
the internet now you know where people

302
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,470
attack everybody the penis' a lot of

303
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:59,709
people can just grow a lot of power and

304
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:02,950
six months later because remember these

305
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,890
things grow from seed to harvest in as

306
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,660
little as seven to nine weeks seed to

307
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,250
harvest so you can imagine there was a

308
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,230
little bit of meeting and in six months

309
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:20,890
you start doing things like this on the

310
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:22,990
boards boom good few houses come on come

311
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:26,320
on come on come on and then they've

312
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:29,500
started to be uniform so autoflowering

313
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:32,259
network formed and water finally network

314
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,640
is the place to go if you are going to

315
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:35,680
get information about boiling and

316
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,900
flowering cannabis not my well go there

317
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,630
because I'll tell you what the growers

318
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,580
are what they're doing so when I wrote

319
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:46,450
the book sorry the right look I didn't

320
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:48,250
give up on my network and I joined I and

321
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,870
I hop on my first of all post is I'm

322
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,519
writing a book she's not looking for

323
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:54,419
some pictures and he wanted to you know

324
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,420
sell some pictures

325
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:14,569
right there you know things have really

326
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:16,429
really teens and I'm learning all these

327
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:18,918
professionals who don't think the coral

328
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:21,679
flowers are any good or just a [ __ ]

329
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:24,288

330
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,210
folks I'll show you where the beef is

331
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:29,720
you can grow these plants big ones

332
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:34,090
little ones Christmas tree style you can

333
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,089
make looping you can see branching very

334
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:49,699
so here's a test

335
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:53,778
hold everything you ever want and then

336
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:57,679
some they're strong there's a draw you

337
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:59,359
have no idea go look up mephesto on

338
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:06,139
instagram and take a look at some of the

339
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:07,788
pictures Oh little teeny guys to this so

340
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:10,490
my wife wonders why do you so excited

341
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:13,369
about a little flower cameras because

342
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:16,849
they're every bit as good as far as I'm

343
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:20,388
concerned that's the big guys and you

344
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:23,148
get incredible quality and from a

345
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:24,199
medicinal perspective the ability to be

346
00:22:23,148 --> 00:22:28,658
able to play around with these things

347
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:31,278
like 88 this is from a company

348
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:34,429
territorial seeds was just it or a note

349
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:37,669
some of you know them territorial seeds

350
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:39,740
has a sister company called new Bri

351
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:41,899
seeds and that's one of their plants I

352
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:48,319
don't think they sell to us anymore I

353
00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:50,209
think they sell so that's 2019 we could

354
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,460
come a long way in just a little bit of

355
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:54,399
time really you know these things really

356
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,610
started to become commercial about

357
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:58,129
2012-13

358
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:59,809
somewhere in there they were really the

359
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,720
first one that lower animals

360
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,879
two or so now you can get seeds

361
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,519
everywhere however left any budding out

362
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,050
of here but you can get seeds all over

363
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:13,369
the place although I understand you

364
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:24,649
can't buy seeds at a dispensary store it

365
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:28,479
here we've got to change some of these

366
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:32,330
lot of them we can ship hemp seeds

367
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,440
there's no THC in the sea some we're

368
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:36,439
going to be able to change some state

369
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,390
programs well all the equipment is now

370
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,049
available if you take the seeds on the

371
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,720
Internet

372
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:43,430
be careful obviously you can get seats

373
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,079
when they are legally sold which is in

374
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:53,779
Oregon in other states and you can see

375
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:59,750
some friends I get all the equipment you

376
00:23:53,779 --> 00:24:01,579
need logos of value or so I'm gonna be

377
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,579
devil's advocate and I'm going to insist

378
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:07,279
that all farming cannabis it is the next

379
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:09,769
and the book I wrote is gonna vote for

380
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,049
you guys it's a book for my mother

381
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:14,599
because I'm convinced this is a plant

382
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:17,569
that she will grow you know it's coming

383
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:20,599
in on October 27th which is unbelievable

384
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:24,579
because I suppose they do but anyways

385
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:24,579
these are spectacular plants

386
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:36,970
you know they look just like tomato

387
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,250
plants take the place of the tomato

388
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,870
plant now remember you got a limit in

389
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,609
some states so you got to be careful if

390
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:52,779
you're in Alaska Tamara this would be

391
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:54,549
pull you in to change once once

392
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:56,740
everybody gets all being excited about

393
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:59,259
almost new tax revenue we're gonna have

394
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,930
to explain them it's just the darn plant

395
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:04,420
for goodness sakes [ __ ] we want

396
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:08,529
period man it used to be if they thought

397
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,910
tomatoes or poisonous and a big Supreme

398
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:12,460
Court case in the early eighteen

399
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:14,670
hundreds of New York State or based on

400
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,390
the steps in the tomato you know they're

401
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:24,039
we're gonna have to convince these

402
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:27,580
people we're not poisonous is impacting

403
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:29,500
the system exactly like the regular

404
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:33,480
cannabis so it's just got a really

405
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:36,069
unique and again the just like tomatoes

406
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,750
with a couple differences so you're

407
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:46,750
gonna have to learn how to tell the

408
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:49,240
difference between flowers that's not

409
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,160
very hard for people to to figure out

410
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,039
when in doubt when you're growing one of

411
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,930
these things just think of it as tomato

412
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,359
now I know most of my books contain all

413
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,070
this scientific Boublil Aachen and

414
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:02,409
everything else about organic gardening

415
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:02,740
to soil food web and all that kind of

416
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,630
stuff

417
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,150
that's above the cannabis plant which is

418
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,010
pretty incredible

419
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:13,500
taken with kind of cameras to take those

420
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:13,500
make little pictures but you know

421
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,390
again if you're growing something that

422
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,070
you're putting in your body I don't care

423
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,259
whether you're smoking it or eating it

424
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:24,909
or using a suppository

425
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:26,470
that'll make a bit of difference you're

426
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,410
putting in your body it auto video

427
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:32,350
organic and if it's not organic

428
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:36,610
shingling you you know so they grow just

429
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:38,619
like tomatoes and you can buy seeds just

430
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:40,808
like you can buy tomato seeds and you

431
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:42,939
should look for the same kinds of things

432
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:44,980
that you look for on a tomato package so

433
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,440
the back should have all the information

434
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,720
that you need in order to be a dummy you

435
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,840
can just look at it and say oh just take

436
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,308
this in the quality for me in school and

437
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,928
it's going to germinate next amenities

438
00:26:54,308 --> 00:27:02,529
all that information needs to be on the

439
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:06,460
back we're gonna help we're gonna help

440
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:10,029
make cannabis less stigmatized by

441
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,600
getting regular gardeners to use this

442
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,879
plant

443
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,529
autoflowering cabinets and the way we're

444
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,559
gonna get them to do it is we're gonna

445
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:20,379
make this plant like any other plant

446
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,298
they buy when they go into a store a

447
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:26,110
greenhouse there are nurseries and so

448
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:29,889
that's what we need to do there are two

449
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:33,129
kinds that if not these really only one

450
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:35,290
kind they call the second kind that's

451
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,900
what we wanted to call it super Auto

452
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:40,928
flowers they're much bigger they usually

453
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,910
take a little bit longer so the average

454
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:45,220
life speed for them is a little bit

455
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:47,500
longer they're equally fun to grow

456
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,210
they're still a little flower they have

457
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,470
all the attributes and in fact that's

458
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:54,180
what the commercial growers are Ken

459
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,400
here's some of the seed packets and sure

460
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,190
enough the seatbacks now all those over

461
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,140
there some of those samples now have

462
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:05,400
information on other people wouldn't

463
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,320
want to have ok soil well it's just like

464
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,540
a tomato so you're growing the same kind

465
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,960
of spoils that you go in tomato man now

466
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:15,139
you know the growing medium as far as

467
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,019
I'm concerned should just be regular

468
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:21,450
great soil not spectacular soil because

469
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:25,049
these things grow very quickly and they

470
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,670
react very quickly to fertilizer and so

471
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:28,349
you want to make sure that they're not

472
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:30,570
being overfed so you don't want the oil

473
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:33,928
that are too heavy to which a little bit

474
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:35,939
of cars get stuck in compost and if

475
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:38,250
you're gonna fertilize particularly when

476
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,320
you start I always suggest people start

477
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,670
just grow the data plant wants to see

478
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,279
what it does don't fertilize them

479
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,650
anything but if you go to fertilize put

480
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:49,410
a little bit of salt in the pot put the

481
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:52,050
fertilizer down then put the soil bit so

482
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,509
that the plant gets about three or four

483
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:56,039
or five weeks where its roots are

484
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:57,690
growing and then we'll go into the

485
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,490
fertilizer than when it needs it it'll

486
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:03,539
beat it it doesn't hit it at the

487
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,980
beginning it's got a pH of six point two

488
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,170
to six point five which is the same as

489
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,779
regular cannabis from a soil food web

490
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:12,539
perspective I know doctor you're laying

491
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:14,308
in and likes to likes to suggest that

492
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:16,500
it's the cannabis is a little bit more

493
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:19,619
fondly dominated than I like to suggest

494
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:22,500
it is like these particular plants they

495
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:25,139
grow so quickly that I'm sure that they

496
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,390
are that purity time so you wanna make

497
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,790
sure that their activities 1981 green

498
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,700
mulch is you want to use you know that

499
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:34,259
clearly dominated compost as far as

500
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,049
nutrients are concerned again is only

501
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:39,058
what a lot of discussion about it but

502
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:41,639
you want to use low numbers this would

503
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:42,899
be sort of an ideal three to four but

504
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,300
the first couple of times

505
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,370
he's the first time to grow you don't

506
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,990
need to use anything look at the plant

507
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,729
you'll see what's going on and you'll

508
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:54,000
realize that it really doesn't mean very

509
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:56,460
much food it's just like a tomato my

510
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,730
father grew tomatoes for 60 70 years

511
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:09,539
this father were Tomatoes sold 10,000

512
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:11,480
every spring from his property and

513
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:14,779
that's the same thing with these guys

514
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,779
good soil

515
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:22,530
Jaqueline they want to use the

516
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,349
mycorrhizae fungi this is the

517
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:27,660
mycorrhizae fungi that infects all

518
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:37,529
cannabis plants and this is the only one

519
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:39,240
really to execute this plan this is

520
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:42,839
what's more use these are the means that

521
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,539
that it used to go by now the DNA this

522
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,639
is the name that it's difficult and it's

523
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:50,399
growing regular cannabis you want to use

524
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,350
that stuff you roll the seeds in it you

525
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,509
put some in the soil as well but you

526
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:56,250
want this stuff they vet those roots as

527
00:30:54,509 --> 00:31:00,230
soon as they come out because they grow

528
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,230
so quickly they may not have enough

529
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:06,750
containers containers

530
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:08,670
I don't like the transplant farming

531
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,859
cameras they go so quickly I like it

532
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:17,789
wrong in the containers that I'm leaving

533
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:19,529
them so all of these are great goes want

534
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:26,069
those air pots they seem to be really

535
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:26,819
fun kind of kind of fun yeah they move

536
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:29,159
like crazy

537
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:32,460
and you want to make sure the Guru

538
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,640
turned good shape this is about what two

539
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,640
weeks

540
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:42,159
look at this I love this against Albany

541
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,370
area

542
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,370
I'm sorry ecology - thank you very much

543
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,369
so

544
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:53,799
so pay attention to it they grow fast

545
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,150
and the reason why I don't like to be

546
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,279
problem is because they grow so fast

547
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,560
then it takes a while for the plant to

548
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,690
regenerate and it you know come back up

549
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,710
to life again they can make up a week a

550
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:07,090
week on a plant that's a 70 day plant oh

551
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,680
you know that's like an eighth of its

552
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:10,359
labor of slaves so you want to make sure

553
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,190
it's in the right container gotta have

554
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:16,990
good drainage obviously and you don't

555
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:18,070
want to do it not a seedling you know

556
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:22,089
and so you don't want to screw it up and

557
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:23,740
if your pots too big integers as far as

558
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:28,539
lights are concerned you know this is an

559
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:30,039
area of one of the debate you know you

560
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:32,349
want to use the best lights you possibly

561
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:34,450
can depending on what your situation is

562
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:37,259
it can be any one of a number of

563
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,880
different kinds of lights you know

564
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,589
situations you've got it a whaler

565
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,150
getting the heat out you know me if you

566
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:46,839
use one kind of you can't you have used

567
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:51,610
other kinds and there's just lots of

568
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:58,000
debate about but use best you can I love

569
00:32:51,609 --> 00:33:00,039
these plasma lights you make the

570
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,630
comparison and figure out what you want

571
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:05,170
to use and where you're gonna grow etc

572
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:08,170
etc and my big advice is you don't go to

573
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:09,279
one of these places to buy you don't go

574
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,200
to one of these places to buy because

575
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,720
you want to talk to people you want to

576
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,370
get the sales pitches you know they

577
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,509
don't know so you want to go to one of

578
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:21,969
these places whether it's a hydroponic

579
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:23,740
store or salsa or whatever and you talk

580
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,829
to people about and you talk to people

581
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,839
who walk in and a buying stuff about

582
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:30,039
what they use and what they have because

583
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:32,259
we're gonna have to try to figure out

584
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:35,440
one of the best friends in place you

585
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:35,799
know they all work some work better than

586
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,809
others

587
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:40,190
I love reflector

588
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,980
to find out that if you use a little

589
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:46,970
leaf oil cost little burns on your plant

590
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:49,370
so there's a little a growth in

591
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,410
spectacular adventure what a spectacular

592
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:54,259
invention that someone will go to for

593
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,790
some undergo six and of course you can

594
00:33:54,259 --> 00:34:00,140
put as much stuff in there one line of

595
00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:10,579
debate about sizes cetera et cetera if

596
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:13,250
you want to have some worry you know or

597
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:14,750
just like in the other plant you don't

598
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,239
worry the one on your work

599
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:19,659
you remember humidity just like any

600
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,279
other plant and so you want to have a

601
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:24,400
humidity that's a little bit higher

602
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,769
maybe sixty seventy percent humidity

603
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,030
during the beginning grow period then as

604
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:30,259
he gets into the flower you want to

605
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,240
bring it down to maybe forty percent

606
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,710
humidity not always the easiest thing to

607
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,658
do but if you can pay attention to it

608
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,280
make sense to do so I want great

609
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,110
emulation because these get the same

610
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,570
diseases the powdery mildew etcetera

611
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:44,809
etcetera as the other plants the bigger

612
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:47,179
cousins you want to put your detection

613
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:48,679
to find out what you've got down in the

614
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:50,418
plants don't put it up in the ceiling

615
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,880
like a lot of people do you might see

616
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:54,109
what's there with your plants and if

617
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,099
something goes wrong with your plants

618
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,960
just woke up what's wrong with the

619
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:58,610
tomato this is what I'm going to tell

620
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,800
people you don't go to a lot of blank

621
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,180
canvas look up a new tomato book what's

622
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,789
wrong with your tomato plant now I

623
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:06,259
should tell people that by looking at

624
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:09,559
the color of a plant we're only getting

625
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,420
a generalized idea there are a hundred

626
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:17,349
different reasons why play whatever you

627
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:20,630
do you know it's not just a matrix it's

628
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:23,869
so again one of the cool things about

629
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,880
these places they grow so fast that you

630
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:27,739
got a bug you know it comes along with

631
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,510
financial plant it didn't blow the

632
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,250
whistle and get the buddies to come on

633
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,410
and by the time the buddies come the

634
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,849
planets past the stage but the things

635
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:37,230
can get so they're really kind of neat

636
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:41,318
you know we do bingo

637
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:43,329
so I really need temperature you want to

638
00:35:41,318 --> 00:35:45,489
keep the temperature obviously in the

639
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:47,260
right zone these are not like tomato

640
00:35:45,489 --> 00:36:45,759
plants so if they get too cool to the

641
00:35:47,260 --> 00:36:47,319
purple you know these things are right

642
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,030
and it's an opportunity here because

643
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:52,568
most of the most of the cannabis we can

644
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:57,220
buy commercially is dry but very very

645
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:59,318
pure this stuff sure is nice so you can

646
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:02,879
try out using my video the methods we

647
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:05,949
love the people bag method and then nice

648
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,900
is curing so it's not something that

649
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:09,899
start with regular cannabis to taste

650
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,250
some of these same things tomatoes as

651
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:17,250
well so it's not gonna be that far the

652
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,929
people you know move into the products

653
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:23,489
training again another element a big

654
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:23,489
debate you know

655
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:32,519
very quickly you know sometimes they

656
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:35,460
really don't need to be trained so

657
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,739
entitled training you just increase them

658
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,409
plant both their straining just like

659
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:44,339
just like it subscribe right there I

660
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:46,519
guess you agree or screen debrief you

661
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,110
know most most rest is easy

662
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:51,869
they don't going to be able then you can

663
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:55,440
get some results that was a what a one

664
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:57,089
pointed and never look at you know so

665
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,460
you could you can definitely see that

666
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,170
the training does help if you do it

667
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,329
there anytime there's a there's a scrub

668
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:08,519
upgrade over there you can pull down

669
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:11,039
beside training them kind of fun or just

670
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:13,079
the Leafs underneath don't keep them out

671
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,329
on the way if you've got a great light

672
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,309
you want to keep inventing a kid in

673
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:19,019
high-stress training they don't spaces

674
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:22,099
leave pinching which we only want to do

675
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:22,099
you just have to do with the right time

676
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:37,989
I promise as far as I was finishing my

677
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:45,370
work team move things with nutrients you

678
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:47,889
seemed so cool good work bo-buds

679
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:51,250
and everything I read you know seems to

680
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:52,629
say though long time never teen can be

681
00:38:51,250 --> 00:39:00,719
really careful when you're treating

682
00:38:52,630 --> 00:39:00,720
these plants so that's again

683
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:14,989
[Music]

684
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,530

that smells like Walter you know he's

692
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:56,539
trying to fellow so carefully very

693
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:58,549
carefully eating any of these plants

694
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:01,279
water flowers also you'll need to break

695
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:03,170
those trichomes and then they degrade so

696
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,400
here that new breed seeds like instead

697
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,608
of pointing you with twenty Tricia's

698
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,630
seed to harvest in baby days and one

699
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:19,190
slide you know so July 2nd July 9 August

709
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:47,210
spare little areas you throw the auto

710

he stayed watch it scum and it did and

827
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:11,118
the same thing is gonna happen tomorrow

828
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:12,980
climate cameras no questions about I

829
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,500
said the same thing about the soil food

830
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,990
web and regenerative soil and all that

831
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:21,579
kind of stuff and it's here the wave is

832
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:21,579
gonna break on us you know

833
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:44,519
I'm quite good at pastry but if you go

834
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:46,760
down to Iliad thing over 27 for your

835
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:46,759
mother

836
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:57,320
[Applause]

837
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:14,230
[Applause]

838
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:16,869
all right so so we're gonna take a bunch

839
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:18,130
of questions and I know that this is a

840
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:21,009
common question that people ask me

841
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:22,539
outside will Jeff asked answer soil

842
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:25,780
questions and I just asked him he said

843
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:28,269
yes so if you've got questions that are

844
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,640
burning in you from these three books

845
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:31,599
you can feel free to ask those but I'm

846
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,329
gonna start you off with an auto

847
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,319
flowering question since they flower so

848
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:41,549
swiftly what size pot do you recommend

849
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:45,220
to leaders to you know the ubiquitous

850
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:46,690
hardware store - yeah so so five-gallon

851
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:48,279
would be a nice table setting for all

852
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:50,200
because it's not gonna outgrow that

853
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,610
right alright great so who have some

854
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:59,969
questions yes look so I saw on your map

855
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:59,970
that you showed that there was in Canada

856
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,880
really yeah so it is my hand breaks up

857
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:15,940
there yeah we have you elastic you have

858
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,760
it here me on our someplace okay look

859
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:22,210
very curious it'll ask us they claim

860
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,310
that the mattress pmdf remind us that a

861
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,320
king from a moody element that somebody

862
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:28,329
found while walking along the Alaska

863
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:41,019
Railroad don't have one track you're

864
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:58,659
right so you can imagine your process

865
00:50:41,019 --> 00:51:01,090
for see ya 20 hours 20 hours later these

866
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:03,639
things of Germany in Germany fast they

867
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:06,370
really do whoa probably really fast

868
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:08,730
really and then you figure out share

869
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:08,730
with you know I

870
00:51:15,610 --> 00:52:09,640
yeah you know it's a hobby

871
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:49,949
people overwater their tomato plants if

872
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,510
you stick the seed in the ground walk

873
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:54,179
away from it and come back two months

874
00:52:51,510 --> 00:53:09,900
later - should be tomatoes on him you

875
00:52:54,179 --> 00:53:12,629
don't have to do anything outdoors so no

876
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,840
I have wishes you know I think a good

877
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:18,539
thing they've seen that more than ever

878
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:20,130
you know the last backtrack bro I got

879
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:22,039
some seeds it's moon these conventions I

880
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:28,230
went to and they were named or anything

881
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:30,059
okay this is again the neat thing about

882
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:32,730
moving look at these places it already

883
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:50,400
got you so we took seven weeks to this

884
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:52,110
happened one of the interesting style

885
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,690
outdoor too when they're being you can

886
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:58,620
do two cycles so a bunch of us just pop

887
00:53:54,690 --> 00:54:01,800
seeds on April 1 we will harvest July 1

888
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:04,319
we will pop on July 1 and a harvest on

889
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:08,630
October 1 so you're getting two cycles

890
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,630
with no light death which is crazy

891
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,500
yes

892
00:54:16,639 --> 00:55:23,969
yeah yeah yeah no yeah it's amazing you

893
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:34,139
know I'm not rushing against it they

894
00:55:23,969 --> 00:55:36,119
making 2014 no it was it was a plant

895
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:39,269
that was brought back from Australia the

896
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:40,889
Australian Aborigine had had that plant

897
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:43,139
in his family for 60 years

898
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:45,599
oh and in case you're interested the

899
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:47,670
person that's Kevin Love from CSI Bible

900
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,219
we imported that and has been a sponsor

901
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:51,539
of India before so yeah and he's got

902
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:55,309
great pictures on his Instagram yeah I

903
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:55,309
think it's called Australian bastard

904
00:55:55,748 --> 00:56:01,788
tic-tac he's the nicest guy yeah what do

905
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:05,088
you see is the downside of feminised

906
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:06,650
seeds well you know separately they

907
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:09,170
there that they got there because they

908
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:11,749
got stressed if they were stressed with

909
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:14,509
gibberellic acid or the or the you know

910
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:16,328
learn it's already there could be some

911
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:18,469
sailor or something cool I don't know

912
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:19,789
it's an interesting question

913
00:56:18,469 --> 00:56:21,618
but on the other hand they can also be

914
00:56:19,789 --> 00:56:44,240
stressed with light and same thing

915
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:45,858
happen so I don't know any information

916
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,719
this is all discussions I've had with

917
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:50,630
different people like dr. parentis

918
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:52,368
considered there is though that

919
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,019
particular one I sure it actually has

920
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:55,670
the other stuff in it is what three

921
00:56:54,018 --> 00:56:57,258
other ones in it and the reason why I

922
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:59,930
think they're in it is because the cover

923
00:56:57,259 --> 00:57:02,119
crops might have a different like

924
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:04,219
horizon and then there are some people

925
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:05,450
who say to me well geez you know since

926
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:07,338
we know that the mic arrives we'll

927
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:09,739
assume and network of conversation

928
00:57:07,338 --> 00:57:12,139
between plants maybe putting in one that

929
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:15,318
connects don't live in plant somehow ok

930
00:57:12,139 --> 00:57:17,858
but I don't think that works so Colorado

931
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:17,858
yes

932
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:22,909
Washington State's one of the few states

933
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:25,748
not the only that is legal that you

934
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:28,338
can't roll without certain restrictions

935
00:57:25,748 --> 00:57:30,738
one response that is perhaps to get

936
00:57:28,338 --> 00:57:33,029
people more familiar with and just five

937
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:35,220
start behind

938
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:37,380
the East one is straight India's

939
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:39,209
potentially offensive advantages are in

940
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:42,599
and energy produced we do the cycles are

941
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:44,780
not intrusive so they're there but they

942
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:48,170
might be able to reproduce

943
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:48,170
oh absolutely

944
00:57:51,769 --> 00:58:23,429
they're so easy we are going to do this

945
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:25,318
you know we want to make sure that the

946
00:58:23,429 --> 00:58:33,328
stuff is here to stay for good then

947
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:35,788
we're going to I think you know for

948
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:39,510
example Hawaii Hawaii and medical

949
00:58:35,789 --> 00:58:42,410
medical marijuana program they teach it

950
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,410
is No

951
00:58:52,119 --> 00:59:19,900
well since you're gonna do that I think

952
00:58:54,429 --> 00:59:39,789
I will point out that I know around the

953
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:42,369
country cycle where I can continually

954
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:43,869
started to plant when my career plank

955
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:46,119
was a flower I could start another one

956
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:47,710
and then I'm topping and harvesting by

957
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:49,809
other plants going into flower starting

958
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:51,340
another one all over the same notes yeah

959
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:56,259
it's amazing I mean it normally would

960
00:59:51,340 --> 01:00:00,519
when I run is just 24 but but the point

961
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:02,380
where I was like oh it's just a terrific

962
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:04,440
plan and you're a terrific guy thank you

963
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:08,119
very much

964
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,119
[Applause]
