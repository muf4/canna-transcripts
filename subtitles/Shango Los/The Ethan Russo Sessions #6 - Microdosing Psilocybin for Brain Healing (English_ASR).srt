1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,160
so Ethan we've been hearing recently

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,120
more and more talk from researchers

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,798
recommending and talking about the

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,320
healthy benefits of

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:20,960
psilocin uh from hallucinogenic

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,198
mushrooms on the healing and rebuilding

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,800
of neural networks after things like uh

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:31,840
traumatic brain injury or a severe uh

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,600
trauma um and you know most of the the

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,238
the crossover media they're just saying

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,800
cybin mushrooms isn't that crazy it's

12
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,078
good for you and they kind of you know

13
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,558
handle it at that level of

14
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:47,399
superficiality um but folks often ask me

15
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,878
what is going on in the brain like at

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,879
the cellular level what does the

17
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:57,479
psilocybin do that helps heal or

18
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,759
regulate or expand the neural network uh

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,558
would you break that out as a

20
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,640
neurologist I figure this is this is

21
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,798
right up your alley uh well you know

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,400
I've been delving into this area for

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,118
decades actually but the fact is in uh

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,759
at the end of 2018 we still don't know

25
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,719
exactly oh wow the conventional answer

26
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,560
is uh that

27
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:24,359
psilocybin and related tryptamine

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,879
psychedelic drugs work on the serotonin

29
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,159
2A

30
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,599
receptor however that is not an adequate

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,280
explanation

32
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,719
uh for the effects that we see with

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,519
these drugs because there are other

34
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,599
drugs that work on the receptor that

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,199
don't have any similar kind of activity

36
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:44,599
particularly the kinds of prolonged

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,680
benefits that we're seeing uh now in

38
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:52,078
controlled uh clinical trials uh

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:57,280
psilocybin has produced um great benefit

40
00:01:52,078 --> 00:02:00,639
in end of life um issues for people with

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,079
um terminal illness particularly cancer

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,680
um additionally uh it's shown long-term

43
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,679
benefits uh treatment of intractable

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,120
depression where even things like

45
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,840
electroconvulsive uh therapy or shock

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,239
therapy have been

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,080
unsuccessful but that's with full

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,599
psychedelic

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,200
doses um of these agents uh we have a

50
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:28,359
phenomenon now that's become quite

51
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:32,598
popular in our society um of using very

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,959
low doses of sub therapeutic doses uh of

53
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:39,639
psychedelics what's called micro doing

54
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:44,560
so this would be a dose that doesn't

55
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:48,799
produce um uh strong alterations in

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,360
Consciousness but um has led to people

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,519
feeling like they have greater levels of

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,959
insight greater levels of

59
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:01,400
creativity um we don't have a lot of

60
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,280
proof of this but we have have hundreds

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:08,400
of anecdotes uh that support this kind

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,280
of thing um there are enough clinical

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,799
trials underway now with positive

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,680
results that support the idea that in a

65
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:21,080
not too distant future another schedule

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,319
one drug uh psilocybin is going to be an

67
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,640
approved

68
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:28,039
pharmaceutical um so there's a great

69
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:31,000
deal to be learned here uh in the 50s

70
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,679
before psychedelics were outlawed uh

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,158
there had been a lot of therapeutic

72
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:41,120
research both with psilocybin and with

73
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:43,798
LSD um but um in a manner analogous to

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,759
what happened uh to cannabis all the

75
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,159
biomedical research stopped in the 60s

76
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,560
when they were outlawed and we've seen

77
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:54,120
this slowly come around in the same way

78
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,479
that uh there's been a Resurgence in

79
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,920
therapeutic cannabis research uh so

80
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,759
interesting times will follow yeah for

81
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:06,280
sure and and I understand um from your

82
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:10,000
paper that um not only do you hold that

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,239
um that do using micro dosing can help

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,759
uh heal and kind of reconfigure the

85
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,560
brain after traumatic brain injury um

86
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,959
but that using it in uh in concert with

87
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,639
canono can actually be better than

88
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,759
either of them alone how do you normally

89
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,160
uh suggest that cannabinoids would be

90
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,360
paired with psilocybin for maximum

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,280
benefit well this is conjectural um we

92
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,600
don't have any studies of the two

93
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:40,439
together uh one of the phenomena that is

94
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,400
common uh with the psychedelics in high

95
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:46,719
doses is uh at least a phase of nausea

96
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:51,399
which is easily counteracted with

97
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,880
cannabis but um in complex psychiatric

98
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:58,519
conditions I I could see the potential

99
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,120
uh for combinations of say lowd do uh

100
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,198
psilocybin

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,639
uh in conjunction with a properly

102
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:10,199
constituted cannabis based preparation

103
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:12,240
preferably cannabid per dominant um but

104
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:16,319
we've got to get one over the finish

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,960
line of approval and then see um more in

106
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,879
a controlled setting of what the

107
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,478
combinations might really

108
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,159
accomplish I think it's going to be

109
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,038
interesting too because as you said we

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,800
don't actually know what the psilocybin

111
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,120
is doing in the brain we've got pretty

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,560
good ideas but the the research has been

113
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,199
quashed but hopefully seems to be coming

114
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,478
back now um but we both know that that

115
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,879
you know self- healers and Psychonauts

116
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:46,360
are going to be going down this path

117
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,279
Alone um uh before the science catches

118
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,400
up since the science has been held back

119
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:55,239
by regulation um would you offer any uh

120
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:56,918
cautions to people who want to uh pursue

121
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,400
this kind of solution on their on their

122
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:02,639
own um considering you know neither

123
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,839
neither mushrooms or cannabis are

124
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,720
dangerous but you know there you might

125
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:10,239
have some uh cautions around dosing

126
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,599
perhaps uh absolutely I I'd emphasize

127
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,240
that uh this should be done in the right

128
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:18,918
environment sa and setting are critical

129
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,280
uh nobody should engage in using a

130
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:24,680
psychedelic unless they're feeling

131
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,638
reasonably secure or in a safe and calm

132
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,120
environment and

133
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,960
absolutely um in the presence of a

134
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,079
respon responsble person who's not uh

135
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,638
engaged in the same activity in other

136
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,839
words a guide uh anything else is

137
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,240
overtly dangerous the danger of any

138
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:47,959
psychedelic is that someone is going to

139
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,319
have uh produce a panic experience um

140
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:54,359
and this can be really really traumatic

141
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:58,598
so I would never downplay that um but in

142
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:02,080
terms of direct toxicity no but uh

143
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:06,199
certainly psycho trauma uh is possible

144
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:10,079
and the best advice is uh to proceed

145
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:15,240
with Extreme Caution um it's much better

146
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:17,959
to use too little than too much um uh if

147
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,478
a person exceeds the threshold of what

148
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:22,159
they can handle they're going to have a

149
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:24,878
bad experience it's going to last some

150
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:30,560
hours and uh it's not going to be

151
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:33,560
remembered um as a good idea yeah um so

152
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,000
again uh they have to engage in

153
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,000
judicious

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,759
dosage uh in a proper setting with very

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,800
good uh supervision when you use use the

156
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,720
term micro doing um what are you

157
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,960
actually talking about because you know

158
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,680
people people are usually talk about

159
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,239
dosing in the you know the regular

160
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,478
citizens stre the nonscience environment

161
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
by weight right and you know whether or

162
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,399
not you're having getting your cybin

163
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,560
from cubes or cyanin they've got

164
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,638
different potency themselves so you

165
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,439
can't just approach um mushrooms by

166
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,800
weight so if somebody had an idea though

167
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,598
of how much active ingredient was in

168
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,319
their mushrooms how much are you looking

169
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,800
for to be a micro do well a threshold

170
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,680
dose for a psychedelic experience with

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,319
with soloc cybin is about 20 mg and this

172
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,478
can vary um so something well under uh

173
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,440
10 Mig is going to represent a micro do

174
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:38,319
and uh could be much lower than that and

175
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,479
as you mentioned if someone's uh doing

176
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,919
this directly with mushrooms it depends

177
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,040
on their potency there are things

178
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:50,519
written about the expected potency of

179
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:55,559
specific species uh they vary a great

180
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:58,679
deal it could be U 1% or less um psybin

181
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:02,639
in cubensis it could be as much as 4%

182
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:04,679
and solos be azer resin um but uh

183
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,439
without knowing what species you have or

184
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,399
anything else um I would always have

185
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,160
people if they're going to go down this

186
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,399
path at all and let's emphasize that um

187
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,399
these agents are still schedule one and

188
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,559
illegal in the United States um but if

189
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,440
they're going to go down that path uh

190
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,559
they should always ear on the side of

191
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,279
too little rather than too much mhm uh

192
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:32,958
go start low and go slow this is the

193
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,720
same adage that we use in relation to

194
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,399
cannabis doing why not excellent if you

195
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,399
want to hear more about this uh there's

196
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,519

197
