all right everybody want to take a seat

2
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:11,820
we are going to get going

3
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,618
welcome to the 2 o'clock

4
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:22,299
panel on choosing your extraction

5
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,789
technology I am your host with camel

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,060

tune in to my podcast where we listen to

12
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:43,000
conversations like this each and every

13
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:46,478
week I would like to first introduce our

20
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:08,978
so these are merely highlight the each

21
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:11,828
speakers bio I encourage you to google

22

00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:17,559
find out more information on these

24
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:19,089
gentlemen are so smart that they go on

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,549
for paragraphs and then we wouldn't have

26
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,850
time for your questions so starting at

27
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:27,189
the far end as Sheldon protal junior PhD

closed-loop Duty extraction systems

49
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,959
queries also founders that will Durango

50
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:23,179
a marijuana reform organization that

51
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,759
coordinated with national activists to

52
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,099
advocate for marijuana decriminalization

53
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:30,079
and regulation the weight of the form

54
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:31,699
has been dealt with this panel here I've

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,079
got a series of questions that I'm going

56
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,578
to ask the gentlemen and starting one

57
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,750
end and we'll start at the other end and

58
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,879
hopefully getting a little bit of

59
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,709
conversation going and we'll take about

60
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,049
10 to 15 minutes at the end for your

61
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,420
questions so we're going to start with

62
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:47,750
with a question on the far end or

63
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:49,879
Rochelle in there so Shelly I work with

64
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,090
clients who have chosen their products

65
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:56,568
for market first and then they choose

66
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,030
their extraction technology to suit the

67
00:02:56,568 --> 00:03:01,128
product of a guideline but I've also

68
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,139
worked with clients who first choose

69
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:05,388
their preferred extraction method and

70
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:08,180
then they design the product on what

71
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:10,480
those technologies can do so where do

72
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,939
you suggest that a new cannabis company

73
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:17,929
looking to extract starts their decision

74
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:19,849
making process well as might each tech

75
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,459
entrepreneurship University the first

76
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:25,699
thing I'd say ask your customer what do

77
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,319
they want so I would I would argue that

78
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,548
you want to start with the customer what

79
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:30,018
does the customer need

80
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,519
what does the customer trying to

81
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,650
accomplish what a problem when you're

82
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,780
solving for the customer build your

83
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,719
formulations based on on that

84
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,140
information and then decide what the

85
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,719
extractions are bouncing

86
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:48,299
patient process would be to meet the

87
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:50,789
specifications to every rhythm of

88
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:55,670
succession law Houston as well because

89
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:58,829
reading a customer gives you markets and

90
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:00,599
yoga without its opponent innovation

91
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,240
because it does probably like invasive

92
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,979
cost but pretty much if you want to

93
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:12,330
examine market tomorrow you to listen

94
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:16,289
yeah so I knowing the important like a

95
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:20,790
great big component of choosing your

96
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:25,500
special technology certain extraction

97
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:30,360
methods are well-suited to killer and

98
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:33,709
odd there's some extraction up it's

99
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,480
better more versatile than others so

100
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:40,918
knowing that end prize you'd like to

101
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:45,990
create whether that high-end concentrate

102
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:48,180
shatter or wax visible it's it rides

103
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,639
your pen or

104
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,170
use edible product or topical cream

105
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,829
those are kind of the major categories

106
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:59,670
vaporizing fans concentrated edible and

107
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:03,029
topical products if there's one of those

108
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:07,080
categories in particular of appealing to

109
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:09,719
your company and we can work backwards

110
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,969
from that to determine which extraction

111
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,500
method is best suited there's some

112
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:20,220
extraction methods that are generally

113
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,850
there well students work for all the end

114
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,700
product and then there's other

115
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:29,129
technologies that you can add your

116
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,889
initial extraction system to further

117
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,420
purify the product particularly on such

118
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,019
dive into that a little bit more as we

119
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,430
go in product doing your end product is

120
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:41,669
of course very important what are you

121
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,280
put the chronic your pre pre market and

122
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,170
if you don't know and maybe a comments

123
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,459
more or necks gosh method more

124
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,460
versatility is

125
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,579
so this will speak so there's a wide

126
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:58,278
range of opinion regarding the use of

127
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:59,178
hydrocarbons like butane propane for

128
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:01,579
extraction

129
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:04,098
you know they get great taste and good

130
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:06,438
return by percent but so if you know how

131
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:09,199
to remove your business solvents in the

132
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:10,519
industry leading to fail lab tests and

133
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,889
sometimes a dangerous product to the

134
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,439
public to what degree do you think that

135
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,588
these technologies will continue to be

136
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:25,968
top-tier options for commercial candice

137
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:28,158
extractors well again unfortunately to

138
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:30,618
the previous question what exactly we

139
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:32,209
need to discuss there are different

140
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:34,490
solvents and their difference of

141
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:39,519
teachers and the plant equal an extra

142
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:42,949
seven teachers they're also a low

143
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:45,168
efficiency Devon there are also wood and

144
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:49,189
water school give us water except one

145
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:55,218
part use multiple nominations was that

146
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:58,459
well you see were expecting and it is

147
00:06:55,218 --> 00:07:01,098
important feature of us for once to get

148
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:03,079
separate ways because simple forward

149
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:04,788
water you may achieve as an extra

150
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,069
attending moon the water that's very

151
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:08,740
expensive process because they have to

152
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:12,550
feed it

153
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,829
it's a long process so see you Julius

154
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,379
that is a process that cannabis

155
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:21,370
automatic eat but then some ability of

156
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:24,009
see with you it's very tricky to set the

157
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,199
point to dissolve and it can result with

158
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:30,759
YouTube and water salt and alcohol

159
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:34,538
soluble edibles of what you need to set

160
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,770
up the impact point of the certain

161
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:40,120
temperature and pressure in order to

162
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:42,698
simply filter actually you take more

163
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,519
that you need again coming back to the

164
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:48,689
question what example you need to strap

165
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:51,279
the truly future stock oils they're

166
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:54,490
nonpolar solvents that can help ease it

167
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,739
up if you want to extract supplements

168
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,918
what's the news

169
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,370
I will say there general solar

170
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:08,680
technologies like my preteens and

171
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:12,579
alcohols and hexane and future different

172
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,189
always use because they generate very

173
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:17,348
well and it can make wrong with you

174
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:21,728
if you know your properties will isolate

175
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:23,860
or isolate and anything else but the

176
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:27,829
first step to conversion of all these

177
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:32,028
from the production that gives you

178
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:35,538
with the consequence that would so

179
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:37,429
couple of sort of parallel things to

180
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:41,179
consider when you're choosing what

181
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:42,079
solvents work with solvent recovery is

182
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,208
very important

183
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,470
so how expensive it is going to be to

184
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,939
recover that solvent

185
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,070
how much energy you're going to Queens

186
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,279
per system because the more difficult

187
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,440
the solvent recovery is and higher the

188
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:57,200
higher cause poor the economics on your

189
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,029
process another aspect is it's in this

190
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,930
particular industry everyone is being

191
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:04,700
very I would say eco friendly so a

192
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:08,539
sustainable environment record which is

193
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,190
really cool to watch and kind of fun

194
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,139
coming out of pharmaceutical industry to

195
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,959
watch that it's constraint and involving

196
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:17,689
with a very very strong go friendly

197
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,699
environmentally responsible mindset so

198
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,220
when you think in those terms think

199
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,528
about how is the solvent don't you

200
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,120
recover and it's not recovered just a

201
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:29,629
little bit doesn't leak out what damage

202
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,278
is going to do to my employee myself and

203
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:33,620
what damage could possibly do to the

204
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,320
environment count by minimize died and

205
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,379
then the other aspect to is then the end

206
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,690
amount of some solvents are more

207
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:44,629
economical to work with so the sort of

208
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,430
this multi-faceted and I hate to use

209
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:50,120
this term - but it's coming down the

210
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:52,759
pipe regulation so you know you've got

211
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,029
OSHA regulations to start with but sorry

212
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,539
folks

213
00:09:54,029 --> 00:10:00,779
coming soon and they're going to require

214
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:02,819
certain controls in place that you can

215
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,689
guarantee to remove that salt from your

216
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,250
system so I think you know long-term

217
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,350
thinking in terms of all these aspects

218
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,389
environmental responsibility economics

219
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,379
and what regulatory issues am I going to

220
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:18,269
be dealing with down the road a bit

221
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:22,950
yeah I think more than you want to your

222
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:25,649
question was what concerns over residual

223
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,320
Falconer is the children's cabinet my

224
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:31,319
hydrocarbon office like direct be okay

225
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,210
because we're talking about products or

226
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,850
customers right and people are really

227
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:40,560
concerned about you know Pho and be a

228
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:43,740
show and envy the core skills a lot of

229
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:48,899
lap up in removing residual also get Ron

230
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,610
yeah so um I think much more assertive

231
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,559
how many years ago one of the great

232
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:57,690
demands that our industry is creating

233
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:00,389
higher quality better person solvents

234
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,790
are becoming more readily

235
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:07,350
or light hydrocarbons amusing and

236
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:10,860
cocaine that means 99.99 hopefully more

237
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:16,379
9 or as close to hundred aqua percent

238
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:18,200
purity so solvent distributors gas

239
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:22,730
distributors are getting better as

240
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:25,810
providing concentrate manufacturers with

241
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,089
higher purity solvents

242
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:31,498
to create great pharmaceutical-grade

243
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:34,600
solidly so that's a good trend that

244
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:41,220
minimizing that concern is always such

245
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:45,659
an alumnus close to pure chemical form

246
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:49,240
to just detainer just propane the best

247
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:54,188
also filtration at this position

248
00:11:49,240 --> 00:12:00,549
closed-loop systems are proving filter

249
00:11:54,188 --> 00:12:03,338
media and process improvements such as

250
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:09,370
doing a butane or propane distillation

251
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:12,160
prior to introducing solvents actual

252
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,948
candidate extraction but just building

253
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,328
the solvent south prior to doing a

254
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:19,990
traction around that removes a lot of

255
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:24,939
traditional family

256
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:27,730
heavy metals and we work in that may

257
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,180
have ended up in a solvent so there's a

258
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,610
number of ways filtration media

259
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:38,049
distillation iron extraction on that you

260
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:40,210
know my residual qualities mmm product

261
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:44,740
and then also the number of great

262
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:45,129
technology after step one which I called

263
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,950
it

264
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:55,289
step one recent turmoil through the age

265
00:12:50,950 --> 00:13:00,400
of extraction you can use white film

266
00:12:55,289 --> 00:13:03,789
system to totally remove residual almond

267
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:08,289
in the process also rationing in

268
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:11,730
separate CBD THC compound to break this

269
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:11,730
the residual Collins beer

270
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,690
you're isolating the compound in the

271
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:23,159
process alternating above so there's a

272
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:25,620
number of techniques and trends and in

273
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:29,899
the industry that are improving the

274
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,669
quality impurity

275
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,949
your children eh-oh

276
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:36,689
right so before you go on I'm

277
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,190
questioning whether or not great light

278
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,860
it's big moon are you in the back able

279
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:45,210
to hear Cory yeah okay great cool just

280
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:49,529
want to make sure yeah Ocean Lakes

281
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:53,580
resolution okay all right all right now

282
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:56,939
that - all right great so so for the

283
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:00,420
next question let's see here

284
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,790
we're back to starting with Dorset issue

285
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:04,889
with so so if you're kind of a lot to us

286
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:06,389
I know that a lot of people I expecting

287
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:09,439
us to be talking about a present

288
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:11,879
existing I jack but as far as

289
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,460
entrepreneurs in the market and what

290
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,919
people are asking for we're talking

291
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,320
about Robin just so pressing flowers

292
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,879
with a little bit of heat has come a

293
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,830
long way from using the hair

294
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,129
straightener to the new scaled up

295
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:29,040
presses that output a flood of brands at

296
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:31,259
one time and yet they don't really feel

297
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,409
ready for large-scale commercial uses

298
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:36,960
that said the returns look pretty good

299
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:38,819
and often on par with BHO and the purity

300
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,900
without question because they don't use

301
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,640
any moment at all

302
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,459
many believe that the chemical

303
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,730
processing is the future but the

304
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,350
technology or has not been upscaled yet

305
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,659
so what are your thoughts on the current

306
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,990
state of blossom style extraction

307
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:57,199
technology and where do they end or

308
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,289
again this is Russians

309
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,350
that user you need a concentrate or just

310
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:07,819
oil from the pot because we move

311
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:11,090
president you get usually in a plant

312
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:14,240
ecology about 30 percent in bed we will

313
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,889
be cheaper said this is lost and when

314
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,799
you use a system like with a little

315
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:21,049
podcast and you really are concentrate

316
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:25,309
where the world is a point was has

317
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:28,549
concentrated 60 to 85 percent and when a

318
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:32,809
boulder concentrate you also are used

319
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:37,399
service activity in the solvent to be

320
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:41,509
able to use that always here like evil

321
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:44,559
products you can count with certain

322
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:49,370
traditions efficient only gums is that

323
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:53,209
if you have a suit for about Rendon it's

324
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:59,269
very simple very clever to do that in

325
00:15:53,210 --> 00:16:01,910
tutoring one on it is it works mostly on

326
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:05,419
Thomas because if you have to process

327
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:08,089
think that the subtle patiently so

328
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:13,378
usually if you want to purchase power

329
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:22,259
switch rather than change

330
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:25,038
poetry's eventually right

331
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:30,269
I think broadly present other mechanical

332
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:32,639
methods of extraction are great but as

333
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:35,089
you indicated that their difficulty

334
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,619
producing scale so that's really the key

335
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:41,489
key point to choosing your technology

336
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:43,829
and what is your probably why would you

337
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:47,939
put how much compromise you really need

338
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:51,298
product if it's small amount you mean a

339
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:56,399
Robin pres or another animal movements

340
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:59,879
activism night water bath over hash like

341
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:05,240
bags or bubble hash wash machine those

342
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:08,128
are much simpler and much less expensive

343
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,759
methods of extraction occurred with saw

344
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:14,009
debase extraction but all the maze

345
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,990
extraction to get a win in terms of

346
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:19,769
issues

347
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:24,559
process to put every day so I think

348
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:24,559
Roger brothers are are really good for

349
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:33,690
contour authentic Martha's they

350
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:36,269
typically get a shadows reduced through

351
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,269
a Robin president typically a premium

352
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:43,230
product in this dispensary is not very

353
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:46,680
well every well-known in just general

354
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:51,500
the general market that's why I can

355
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:54,539
serve a mark on for product that whole

356
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,099
forgotten in the know know how know

357
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:58,710
about different extraction methods are a

358
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:01,819
little bit more I tuned the industry I

359
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:05,670
request that work bubble hash

360
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:08,189
concentrate but then though they not

361
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:11,240
efficient method of production for

362
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,240
edible oil

363
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:19,349
or any other form of concentration at

364
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:21,570
scale in a production ten o'clock I

365
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:23,909
would say the one advantage to the price

366
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:28,349
type or mechanical abstraction system we

367
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:31,200
have it is not no confuse the material

368
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:34,109
with the we call it adventitious agent a

369
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,720
solvent that was not normally there so

370
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:38,579
at some markets it's going to have a

371
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,529
benefit because you're not going to have

372
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:41,909
exposed to these extra agents on the

373
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:45,379
other hand you get a very different

374
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:48,390
product so I think again gentleman said

375
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,280
it often times look back to which

376
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,190
customer and what kind of product or

377
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,119
they want to going the server poisons in

378
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,700
the market

379
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:59,339
I think somebody can figure out how to

380
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,289
scale it it's very competitive but I

381
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,939
think that scaling issue and that's

382
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:06,119
probably around the corner because of

383
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:09,840
course that they use similar types of

384
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:12,119
technologies with other seed oils and

385
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,279
that's not a very very large scale so

386
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,869
there's a particular case and it's only

387
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,460
a matter of time before some engineer

388
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:18,989
figures it out and there doesn't seem to

389
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,569
be a lot of people think about that

390
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,880
technology now might be good like or

391
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:26,639
even is it how does do revive and keep

392
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,710
it you know the temperatures have gotten

393
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
so low at this point it does a pretty

394
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,420
decent job with server

395
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,210
like that yeah unfortunately probably

396
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:39,259
it's probably just for because we were

397
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:41,360
having and not it purpler now maybe but

398
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:43,460
it's also I think yet to be my voice

399
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,439
wasn't pretty can do with the downstream

400
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,730
right so what other processes that

401
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,070
you're going to go through as well of

402
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,930
course I'm sure I'm going to get at the

403
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:56,599
Ellen's I've seen our question with I

404
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,900
think a lot impressed these two factors

405
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:02,269
extractor is like the select ability

406
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,700
using a solvent so I and then efficiency

407
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:07,309
the extraction process by plated rasa

408
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,190
prices probably proficient Buffett and

409
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:12,109
has really no select ability that would

410
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,759
be drawback or if you're just trying to

411
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:18,679
extract air working from the plantings

412
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:20,329
it's okay but it's not as likable I get

413
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,160
this goes back to the original round of

414
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:23,809
questions when we're talking about what

415
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,000
you're producing and for a lot kind of a

416
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,169
customer because if you're looking if

417
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,049
you're looking for use a product that

418
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,330
you whole plants right so especially for

419
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:34,129
your protagonist discussion in a take

420
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:36,710
medical so we're thinking a lot about

421
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,390
whole brand healing immersed in a

422
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,940
technology that's going to pull out you

423
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,309
know to learn attaboy

424
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,259
to be used at ice

425
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:46,989
that certainly broadens is not going to

426
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:49,329
be an appropriate technology yeah so I

427
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:52,329
remember that so so all three of you

428
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:55,358
gentlemen have expertise on a wide range

429
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:57,339
of extraction technologies but I also

430
00:20:55,358 --> 00:21:00,089
expect that you each probably have at

431
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,858
least one solution that you feel to be

432
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:06,519
you know either the best or at least the

433
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:08,888
one that you most recommend to cannabis

434
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:13,388
entrepreneurs who are moving into

435
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:15,608
extraction and so my question is what

436
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:18,098
are you recommending to people right now

437
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:22,749
we're going into business as your

438
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:27,069
preferred solution so we want sort of

439
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:29,440
Sonia okay so where do our group works

440
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:33,848
on the downstream side so we actually

441
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,159
don't have a preferred method for people

442
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:37,239
like me don't narrow it down down I mean

443
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,059
what does that mean sure

444
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:45,729
so the downstream side so it's the way

445
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:50,098
we view the materials working with

446
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:53,409
there's a crude crude oil extract has

447
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:56,019
hundreds of compounds in it that's what

448
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:58,479
we refer to extraction as an upstream so

449
00:21:56,019 --> 00:22:00,608
that's even upstream from that at the

450
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:02,288
plant itself to grow the plant under

451
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:04,978
certain conditions the plant makes

452
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:06,680
certain combination of the different

453
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:10,190
phytochemicals

454
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,710
that have their various activities the

455
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,620
next step is to extract those chemicals

456
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,880
out - it's called crude crude material

457
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:20,089
which is what most folks are working

458
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,860
with right now and then our idea is that

459
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:25,009
you go one step further now and you

460
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:27,769
start separating all those components of

461
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,900
the plant into their individual chemical

462
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:35,240
constituents and then because the two

463
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:37,610
things and so that that after the

464
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,640
extract will be refer to as the

465
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:42,649
downstream certification so for those of

466
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,150
us that work more on the downstream side

467
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,940
where we're trying to separate

468
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:50,210
everything we've developed it a really

469
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,789
technical regard to how you extract and

470
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:55,190
so our systems can handle any type of

471
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:58,069
material coming off the extraction and

472
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:01,640
so intentionally we're not worried too

473
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:04,599
much about whether it's using co2 freon

474
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,800
butane or in the other types of solvents

475
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:08,449
because our system is designed to be

476
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,759
able to separate all that's left out I

477
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,890
think so your your starting point is not

478
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,960
the flower or trim your starting point

479
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,150
is the oil and after your posting about

480
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,660
what to do with it that going forward

481
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,660
that's right

482
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:32,410
well our company designs different

483
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:35,529
systems hexane routine alcohol what is

484
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:40,800
team water but we're here talking about

485
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:40,799
a solvent called pre-owned is the most

486
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:56,440
most litigious to extract samples CBD

487
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:58,809
THC and entering and curative Rio is as

488
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,620
with this plant because business

489
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:06,450
activity we measures over 95% efficiency

490
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:08,739
attacks which is very very you know each

491
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,680
delete any possible setting after you

492
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,170
have desta talked about the pool parties

493
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,590
were not into the default on expert and

494
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:21,720
we wanted to a concentrate or isolate we

495
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:27,909
won this ISIL this experts or assistant

496
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:32,769
like HPLC and we get like a tinnitus at

497
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:35,160
UCB GE and we separate the service

498
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:35,160
another

499
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:41,139
so in our case are using pre-owned it's

500
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,259
advantage because of course the be 40

501
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:47,350
minus 30 degree C that means that you

502
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:50,309
know what some temperature is well in

503
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:56,519
gaseous state so Molly he took the clock

504
00:24:50,309 --> 00:25:00,069
Torretta G and you can like prepared to

505
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:05,049
unfold in deviating water point compared

506
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:06,759
to few days of audio and always hear

507
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:12,369
Chile's kind of competitive together

508
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:17,829
girls on the same types of Rihanna's the

509
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:21,219
problem of toxic I also data Association

510
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:24,699
said concentration in violence takes the

511
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,680
world for hours while April Santha

512
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,490
course Eugene and Marvel can make you

513
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:33,160
printed employment and this was an

514
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:36,519
immediate violence Bob it happens it has

515
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,620
a compulsion for work with robotics ties

516
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:40,930
together what without by obtaining with

517
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:44,889
a refrigerator it's not mistaken and

518
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:49,539
part of medicine to extraction succeed

519
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:52,660
looking for gbng is law so as reading

520
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:55,240
about this technology integration prism

521
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:58,420
and the number the returned numbers were

522
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,759
pretty astonishing you know it

523
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:03,009
how long does technology in around

524
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,019
because you actually downloading and

525
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:06,490
call up some of my extractions are

526
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:07,569
living that you heard about this pure

527
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:10,990
project

528
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:13,329
using freon drop rate on and so on and

529
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,279
then equip them of the interview that

530
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:18,189
you saw how hard was the technology

531
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,950
visit the purified without radiance

532
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:23,410
geopipes is normal in the last year's as

533
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:27,660
we enter the cannabis killed before that

534
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:30,880
or told us we were doing aromatics and

535
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:35,980
Primus in favor of marketing exception

536
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:38,799
of growth model of oils of 32 different

537
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,500
and being naughty for a long time is the

538
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:45,788
residual industry it's approved by FDA

539
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,909
since 2001 and in Europe's misogyny

540
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:56,440
report for very poor and struggling

541
00:26:48,909 --> 00:27:00,460
muscle being around food so we found it

542
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:02,350
been proven in other industry but it is

543
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,720
a rival candidate is the part that's

544
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:06,819
more not necessarily technology though

545
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,548
yes because kind of individual spin of

546
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:16,538
all so you just respond to general soul

547
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:19,119
whatever out there and when we talk

548
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:21,638
about traction about box care about

549
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:25,739
boredom I certainly see a lot of the

550
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:28,269
property are the machines available

551
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,058
commercially yet for candidate or are

552
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:33,308
you silly nothing started load that

553
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:35,710
you're still learning how to produce

554
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:38,888
energy for for specifically candidates

555
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:42,308
one yes there's elbow I was publishing

556
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:43,959
they start about 20 concentrate and our

557
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:47,528
last machine expect officers

558
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,940
so we have a lot of storage section cool

559
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:50,740
thank you I once spent a little more

560
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,808
time on this because the technology that

561
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,028
I had Africa I'm not sure if all of you

562
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:57,099
that here so ticklish in you Corey

563
00:27:55,028 --> 00:28:01,778
so so are you recommending the people

564
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:06,638
down why both of the closure some

565
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:08,079
extraction where I work is manufacture

566
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:12,308
closed loop

567
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:15,388
butane extraction so the reason we

568
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:19,888
decided to build our business around

569
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:23,349
others play hydrocarbon such as propane

570
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:26,769
it's simply more efficiency and

571
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:32,408
versatility in product being engraved

572
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:37,019
with like hydrocarbon extract and the

573
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:39,600
whole spectrum from old kettle oil

574
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:43,798
highly purified oils

575
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:47,069
vaporizer cartridges topical creams and

576
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,408
then you need to butane raw concentrates

577
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:54,048
as a shatter it's difficult to reverse

578
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:57,809
engineer concentrate your maths

579
00:28:54,048 --> 00:29:00,658
independence so ptn offers great

580
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:03,960
versatility in terms of attempt rods you

581
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:07,799
can create our art women we focus on

582
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,590
producing old cannabis oil that can be

583
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:13,229
further refined to whichever particular

584
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:15,598
type of a product our customers are

585
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:19,499
making so versatility is really

586
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:21,358
important because we operate as

587
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:26,940
relatively low pressures especially

588
00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:29,970
considered here - supercritical co2 raw

589
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:33,419
material cause of that component of the

590
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:36,929
extractor are much less so electronic

591
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:42,179
equipment cost is very attractive or

592
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:45,149
butane attractive and then cycle time is

593
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:47,909
very important how long it takes to

594
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:55,428
reduce our oil giving months

595
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:58,829
so you can extraction do to our bathroom

596
00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:04,379
fast now there's a number of advantages

597
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:07,558
and Duquesne solvent well established in

598
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:10,798
our industry and concentrates are

599
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:12,209
produced via detain extract especially

600
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,168
because of its ability to preserve

601
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:18,929
curbing robot labor aromatic plant for

602
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:23,900
that reason you can extract one more

603
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:26,390
High Times Cannabis Cup rewards more

604
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,940
concentrate or

605
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:31,190
I mean have them talk and that's the

606
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,860
road there right because butane you know

607
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,558
you came down oil keeps the Turks on

608
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:38,990
point at a fantastic well you really

609
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,398
need to know who your processor is and

610
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,829
as they're getting rid of the residual

611
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,949
solvents it's amazing how many cups

612
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:48,199
you'll go to and and you know you see

613
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:51,319
the oil at like great color and the

614
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,970
judges will taste it or not saying what

615
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,730
are they do things but then the testing

616
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,890
comes back and they all blown their

617
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:00,860
numbers on residual solvents and you

618
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:03,259
know that that the extractor will lead

619
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,839
that it was great because they sent a

620
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:08,778
thousand dollars to enter and in all of

621
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,579
the samples as well but well they had

622
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:13,398
the extraction done they didn't know how

623
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:16,960
to clean up after well I'll play that

624
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:20,569
jumping regulated environments where

625
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:25,548
extraction dates or solvent extraction

626
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:28,500
is regulated the residual solvent amount

627
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:31,740
usually you can

628
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,200
you can parts per million is a tablished

629
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:38,038
regulated and before you're able to take

630
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,529
us all there is extract to the market

631
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:46,230
you have to have no passion that tested

632
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:49,200
so the actual amounts parts per million

633
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:51,450
vary state to state the pl become more

634
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,569
standardized over time

635
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:59,130
Plus in regulated markets

636
00:31:54,569 --> 00:32:04,798
you can't release extracts or edibles or

637
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:07,049
any solvents team oils that were derived

638
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:11,700
in holidays crashed into the market that

639
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:14,069
don't meet those you know 50 to rational

640
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,110
so the candidate comes good you know

641
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:19,349
that there are a little relaxed in terms

642
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:22,319
of who can enter who consumed in

643
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:25,649
concentrated collapse so like types of

644
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:28,069
higher residual solvent and no type of

645
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:29,420
settings that an actual

646
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:33,169
that's our medical are on our

647
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:35,900
recreational yeah very true so the next

648
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:38,269
question is is going to go in a totally

649
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:42,259
different direction but considering

650
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:44,809
we're speaking to you know candidate

651
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:46,849
Oscar Newars who are looking to buy

652
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:50,059
extraction cliff equipment instead of

653
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:52,309
labs you've all worked in extraction

654
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:54,049
labs to some degree or another and had

655
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:56,419
assistance helping you along the way

656
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:58,669
look lighting so for those in the room

657
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,050
who be taking your advice to the bank

658
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,300
when they use it to build their

659
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:05,389
extraction companies what attributes

660
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:07,730
should they look for in extraction lab

661
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,500
staff there are a lot of mighty the

662
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,930
kinds of people that can be hired for

663
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,299
the lab what would you recommend to be

664
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:17,480
some attributes that business owners

665
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:18,799
look for in lab extractions staff and

666
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,650
we'll start off with usual

667
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,529
all right so staffing the medical you

668
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:27,890
want to bring in they're not expert

669
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:30,619
yourself in the chemistry behind systems

670
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:34,340
I I would definitely look for

671
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:36,229
experienced chemist or a biochemist who

672
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:39,019
is done in types of extractions maybe

673
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:42,549
not necessarily on cannabis but services

674
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:44,389
maybe in the flavor of pregnancy markets

675
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:48,349
or a lot of these folks will have

676
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:50,390
expertise in doing extractions handling

677
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:52,730
the equipment doing the chemistry that's

678
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,890
required and understanding how the

679
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,500
process can vary and those sorts of

680
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:59,259
things so that does become one

681
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:02,829
technical background your be person

682
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:04,720
should have at least I would say five

683
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:07,119
years more experience with the wine

684
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,809
recommendation and then the staff

685
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,579
support that person could be anywhere

686
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:14,679
from someone with an associate's degree

687
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:17,348
on up

688
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,269
but trainable they're going to have to

689
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:21,909
learn the chemistry of the process and

690
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:23,800
any systems do run out of air pressure

691
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:26,039
of some degree there's a little bit of

692
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,869
you know I know I don't like arthritis

693
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:31,480
aesthetically yet you want to make sure

694
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:33,550
that they understand the rules behind

695
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:40,119
the chemistry and biochemistry of

696
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:43,629
operating systems all that is certainly

697
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,599
one thing that we had our systems and

698
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:50,168
also you know identities were given

699
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:53,580
earlier you need to avoid this bottom

700
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:56,319
select extract within two to three hours

701
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,119
maybe the best person to operate our

702
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,250
machine is to the reservation condition

703
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:05,410
first novels one on the side the future

704
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:08,108
one of the earliest sources healing and

705
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:10,960
have so much consistency of attack they

706
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:13,590
don't need to even think about tap

707
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,960
temperature one hand the solid will

708
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:22,260
they have a low temperature of thousands

709
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:25,440
upon 20 weeks and days law nominating

710
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,660
that's you to change maybe some very

711
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,639
climate play you have broadly in your

712
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:36,539
life that machine and for high degree of

713
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:43,009
doctor and said that not I don't think

714
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:45,389
there's a high educational market leader

715
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:49,980
Colonel Muammar yet

716
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:52,789
wasn't even operate equipment including

717
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:57,260
a lot of distance are adding

718
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:59,670
semi-automated or automated building so

719
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:03,030
they don't think unless you're producing

720
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:05,820
a very highly formulated very refined

721
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:08,730
product that you need to have goats are

722
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,280
about chemist or amount of chemists have

723
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,500
a lot of consultants electing help you

724
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,640
going to establish your SOPs your

725
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:22,230
standard operating procedures review the

726
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:23,429
perfect extraction was your frog lab you

727
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:31,309
don't necessarily have to increase your

728
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:31,309
arrow I'm having degree workers

729
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:36,609
so emotionally well we have a little

730
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,250
controversy here I could really just I

731
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:42,849
disagree with that I'm an investor -

732
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:45,940
okay I want to be experienced person on

733
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:48,099
staff with one foot money in here so

734
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,440
that's another side the gentleman or

735
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:52,779
corrector in students are owned by

736
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,240
Harper you can use well so a lot of

737
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,570
these instruments by design are intended

738
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:01,269
begins of years and maybe even get away

739
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,350
with using an experienced person I would

740
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:04,750
feel more comfortable with an

741
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:06,489
experienced person you also have to be

742
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,019
mindful how your investors are going to

743
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:10,569
view it because that's another dynamic

744
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:13,150
it comes into this Jerrod tried to raise

745
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:15,250
to half a million dollars and to operate

746
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,900
some of these instruments your investors

747
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,820
what I see that items who have the

748
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,320
expertise or somebody on staff tub I

749
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:24,460
mean that's my perspective as an

750
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,740
investor I would want that could I exert

751
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,500
evoke that I work with regularly because

752
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:31,299
you know your your your train staff is

753
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,670
not necessarily there of the everyday

754
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,350
because you can job threat an active

755
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,900
learner and you'll be able to run your

756
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:40,329
Wow on every day it's on your worst day

757
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,950
that you need to add something strained

758
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:44,019
and I think that there's a lot things

759
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:46,569
like my things up with things so that is

760
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:49,150
wrong and they can they will happen if I

761
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:51,580
could mr. Wolman on developing override

762
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:54,340
very quickly you want to have an expert

763
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:55,989
around this callback reps we've got time

764
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:59,320
enough just for a couple questions

765
00:37:55,989 --> 00:38:01,809
could I just wondered when you have an

766
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,950
investment in two buildings you call

767
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:06,279
lawns and talking to somebody

768
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:09,269
knowledgeable good point

769
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,580
true another question is something that

770
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:14,619
about eight years ago I sold the first

771
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:17,889
butane extractor to the industry bill

772
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:19,630
could you think about answering all the

773
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:21,309
guys that were doing the extraction

774
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,140
didn't have a lot of experience in the

775
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:25,690
market we have a lot of education what

776
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:27,099
they were looking for so full spectrum

777
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,440
extractions were kind of what they were

778
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:31,599
going at meal maybe oil checks they did

779
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,130
not a select now you're in a highly

780
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,829
selective industry where they're trying

781
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,440
to play and targeting

782
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:39,239
making an extractor that can be more

783
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,429
selective but the way that we're going

784
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:42,959
to go is the way it is going we're going

785
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:44,579
to start extracting everything from to

786
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,090
fight with these post operation

787
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,900
processes take one so I think you know

788
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:52,030
all right into place

789
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,440
go upscale large production you're not

790
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,080
going to be trying to make anything a

791
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,760
plan B they are seeing everything I want

792
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,889
and then after the fact cigarette you

793
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,750
want to slice out but right now you want

794
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:03,879
to contributing and then later you need

795
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:07,030
to build into you know something else

796
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,610
now linked to pregnant not state like

797
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:12,460
page one extractions is pulling out off

798
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:14,559
your your full cannabis oil it happens

799
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:19,809
really much a lot of close to the charts

800
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:22,840
but admit it total at other solvents to

801
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:25,750
make sure target all the people here in

802
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,180
the plant can do just one even ethanol

803
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:32,139
fuel Jews broad as they are they're not

804
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:34,809
highly flavor that one to prevail that's

805
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:38,379
true hidden in Basel that have stage 1

806
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:40,509
and stage 2 is ography or

807
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,780
rationalization and you really further

808
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:48,490
separating those compounds if you have a

809
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:50,230
product number spotters so you have time

810
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:53,439
for one more question we have one return

811
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:55,690
it spring on there you are you late

812
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,619
another go salsa signatory on and be

813
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:01,990
resource retired becoming puzzle but the

814
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:04,179
bigger issue where we do with all the

815
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:06,250
customers together either point point if

816
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:08,049
you have to separate them

817
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:12,219
- virtue like the Triton for three or

818
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:15,670
four and different Rios salt ever dishes

819
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:17,529
but they all have like people 24 2002

820
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,079
same point one within the television

821
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:22,840
very have you you have to be to it you

822
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,929
cannot you have some been everything and

823
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:28,870
George Brown you dozen are refillable

824
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:31,659
thank you with all the temples such

825
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:35,799
continues you have so we didn't waiting

826
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:40,029
of instruction offered we have to

827
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:43,740
maintain a proposal to people today who

828
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:46,600
have fought our way away regular said

829
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:49,000
consolable at adult but amusing after

830
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:51,670
like we work for 20 minutes feel and

831
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,170
then run ethanol so we tell you an old
