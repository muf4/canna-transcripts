2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,240
most cannabis enthusiasts live

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,839
somewhere in the murky area between

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,320
science and bro

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,800
science we all aspire to have accurate

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,800
information but because of prohibition

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,480
we don't have a lot of good answers to

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,760
many important cannabis medicine

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,920
questions yet

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,880
and so for many it's easier for them to

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,240
give you their best

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,640
guess rather than say they don't know

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,079
and so it goes with so many cannabis

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
educators as well

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,079
it's not hard to get a speaking gig on

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,960
cannabis medicine at a cannabis

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,600
convention

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,558
without any actual scientific or medical

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,399
training

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,599
i've seen a multitude of speakers and

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,039
panelists who were simply

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
parroting what they heard from someone

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,280
else or something they read in an

24
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,280
unsourced internet post

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,439
too many medical cannabis speakers

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,000
vaguely explain the endocannabinoid

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,159
system

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
and when you ask follow-up questions

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,718
reply with additional vagueness and

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,320
platitudes but not very much detail or

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,000
scientific rigor

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,319
these are the charlatans and

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,920
carpetbaggers that degrade our community

34
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,158
as a whole

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
however there's a new breed of cannabis

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,439
educator ready to replace these folks

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,079
they are well educated well spoken

38
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,399
enough

39
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,158
confident enough and full of heart and

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
the right intentions

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,840
i'm seeing more and more of a new

42
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,039
generation who are able to study

43
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
cannabis medicine

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
or the cannabis plant in school they

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,118
combine

46
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,118
the highest ideals of our community with

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,400
the knowledge that comes from rigorous

48
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,640
study

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,320
i am exceptionally enthused by this new

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,759
generation of cannabis leaders

51
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,599
and look forward to working with them

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,280
and someday handing off the baton to

53
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,679
them as they take over

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,759
i encourage you to do the same if there

55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
is someone that you follow online that

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,680
has the depth and accuracy of

57
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,599
information that you respect

58
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,000
take a moment and tell somebody about

59
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,039
them or make a post to your social media

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,519
about them

61
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,600
intentionally help their message rise

62
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,920
above the noise of charlatans

63
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,599
so that more of your friends and family

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,560
have the opportunity to learn from

65
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,038
someone offering

66
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,719
real science and real actionable

67
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,279
information

68
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,560
shining light on good cannabis people is

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,680
an act of cannabis

70
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,520
activism if you want to learn about

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040
cannabis health business and technique

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,480
efficiently and with good cheer

am your host shango los

94
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,158
today my guest is miyabi shields phd

95
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,199
dr shields is co-founder of real

96
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,679
isolates which

97
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,439
ironically focuses on the importance of

98
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,439
secondary plant components and

99
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,598
synergistic cannabis blends

100
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,280
so essentially whole plant medicine

101
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,799
miyabi received their phd in

102
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
pharmaceutical sciences

103
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
focusing on the biochemistry of the

104
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,360
endocannabinoid system

105
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,919
from northeastern university in 2018.

106
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,360
miyabi has authored or co-authored six

107
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,439
peer-reviewed publications

108
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
and presently has a patent under review

109
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,878
for a novel

110
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,200
fungus and plant extraction method

111
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,318
miyabi also has a substantial list of

112
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,399
honors and awards

113
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,158
including a 2016 international

114
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
cannabinoid research society

115
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,840
pre-doctoral research award their tick

116
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,000
tock channel

117
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,920
at miyabi phd has 130 000 followers and

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,199
is where i first met miyabi

119
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,238
today we're going to focus on the

120
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,679
detailed mechanics of the

121
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,920
endocannabinoid system

122
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,280
and further understand how cannabis

123
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,598
medicine works

124
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,878
welcome to the show miyabi thanks for

125
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,438
having me so

126
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,479
cannabinoids interact with cannabinoid

127
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,199
receptors

128
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,158
in the endocannabinoid system and they

129
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,639
do that by

130
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,239
binding with those receptors that's how

131
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,279
they take action that's how they do what

132
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,519
they do

133
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,560
but what is actually going on at a

134
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,918
chemical level

135
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,680
when a cannabinoid pings a receptor

136
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,439
most cannabis educators just kind of

137
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240
generally explain agonist

138
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,079
and antagonist and leave it at that but

139
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,560
my audience really wants to understand

140
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,359
what's going on at that granular level

141
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
so if you would

142
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
please explain what's going on at that

143
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
point of the receptor and

144
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,680
maybe include why some cannabinoids act

145
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,000
upon some receptors and not others

146
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,840
all right so we're gonna dive into

147
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,959
structural biochemistry then

148
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,279
but a protein so receptors are proteins

149
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,599
um and not protein like nutritional

150
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,719
protein that we eat in our diet but a

151
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,439
protein

152
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
molecularly just means a long string of

153
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,959
amino

154
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
acids so basically the receptor is this

155
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,198
giant

156
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
ribbon of amino acids which are it's a

157
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,439
really long molecule

158
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,680
and it forms these different shapes and

159
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,360
the receptors like the gpcr is a

160
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,360
which is a type of receptor which is

161
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,840
what the cannabinoid receptors are

162
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
happen to be these shapes that have like

163
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,758
seven

164
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,519
like helixes or cylinders and they're

165
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,600
they're arranged in such a way that

166
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,599
they're floating around in our membranes

167
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,919
and what actually happens when a

168
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
molecule binds to a receptor is that it

169
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,839
changes

170
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,759
the shape very very slightly and that

171
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,119
change in shape which we call a change

172
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,759
in conformation

173
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,280
is what activates or inactivates the

174
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,759
receptor so

175
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,478
this is like it's it's this amazing

176
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,639
process

177
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,240
where when thc binds to the cb1 receptor

178
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,079
when it changes the shape of the

179
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,478
receptor by binding it

180
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,240
um all of a sudden this new area of the

181
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,599
receptor becomes available because if

182
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
you're imagining these

183
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,639
seven cylinders all kind of floating

184
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,199
around all of a sudden when thc binds

185
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,439
it arranges the seven cylinders you know

186
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,520
such that this other patch is available

187
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,959
that starts the signaling process it's

188
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,918
called a signaling cascade

189
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,478
that happens afterwards um and in terms

190
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,639
of why

191
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,879
certain molecules have different actions

192
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,038
or can bind to different receptors

193
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,478
um that that comes down to three

194
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,360
different things

195
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,399
and the first one is shape so you know

196
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,840
everyone's heard

197
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:30,318
square peg round hole the same thing

198
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,159
with receptors and with molecules there

199
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,479
is a binding pocket

200
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,600
for most molecules which is on the

201
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,680
receptor it's like

202
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,639
a piece of the receptor that's shaped

203
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,120
such that it can

204
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
accept these molecules now in the cb1

205
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,240
receptor

206
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,199
thc binds you know somewhere towards the

207
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,079
top

208
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,478
um and it binds every single time in the

209
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,719
same

210
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,399
exact way because it fits into this

211
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
shape like a square peg

212
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,839
and another molecule that doesn't fit

213
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
into that pocket

214
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,359
will not bind to that receptor so that's

215
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,919
the first thing

216
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,759
and the second thing is charges like

217
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,639
positive and negative charges

218
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,639
so in chemistry there are partial

219
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,960
positive and negative charges and just

220
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
like

221
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,159
magnets they attract and repel one

222
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,799
another

223
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,280
so inside in addition to the binding

224
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,478
pocket

225
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:21,038
having a very specific shape there also

226
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,680
are very specific charges almost like a

227
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,800
magnet

228
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,079
that interact with the charges on thc or

229
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,960
cbd that then help to bind it even

230
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,839
closer

231
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,598
um and then the third thing is what's

232
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,719
called van der waals interactions but

233
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,719
it's really

234
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,639
um a metaphor for that i just think of

235
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,840
it like fatty velcro

236
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,160
because molecules that are very fatty

237
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,000
like the cannabinoids which are you know

238
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,240
extremely fatty molecules

239
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,120
they can have these interactions with

240
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,199
each other where they

241
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,800
they kind of stick to other fatty

242
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,879
molecules

243
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
and that's the third thing that kind of

244
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,720
binds these molecules to the receptors

245
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,560
and you have to have a match-up between

246
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,440
the shape the charges

247
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,240
and the fatty velcro for a molecule to

248
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,319
have what's called

249
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,960
affinity to a receptor which just means

250
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,479
that the molecule will bind the receptor

251
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,159
and then the next step further will be

252
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,279
what happens to the receptor when that

253
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,680
molecule binds

254
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,439
so what you were mentioning about like

255
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,079
the different ways in which

256
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,478
a molecule can interact with a receptor

257
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,399
thc is often called a partial agonist

258
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,598
for a cb1 receptor that means that it

259
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,679
turns it on

260
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,319
but only partially and this is because

261
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
when thc binds it changes the shape to

262
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,959
turn the receptor on

263
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
there are other molecules that can also

264
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,158
bind to the receptor

265
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,399
but they change the shape in a different

266
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,158
way that leave the receptor off

267
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,240
these are called inverse agonists and

268
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,480
then there are molecules that bind

269
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,480
and don't change the shape at all and

270
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,320
these are called neutral antagonists

271
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,759
so there's and that's just you know

272
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,640
those are the three main ones there's

273
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,120
actually

274
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,439
a large array of other interactions that

275
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,480
the molecules have but i'll stop there

276
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,760
i like that idea that you've got these

277
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,879
these uh these spirals

278
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,000
and and the cannabinoid approaches the

279
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,200
receptor

280
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,919
and those excite somehow and then reveal

281
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,640
this this lock that the cannabinoid may

282
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:20,838
or may not have the appropriate key for

283
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:23,600
um does the does the receptor

284
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,880
get sick

285
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,959
or excited to reveal that lock to every

286
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,320
cannabinoid that goes by that seems like

287
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,359
that would use a lot of energy

288
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,040
or or does the receptor know when it's

289
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,480
being approached by the cannabinoid

290
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,120
if it's the right one that it should

291
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
change shape for so this is actually

292
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,799
what's the most like what's the most

293
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,080
fascinating thing to me

294
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,838
about biochemistry is that nothing

295
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,480
is conscious and nothing no these

296
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,279
receptors and the enzymes the proteins

297
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,440
all the signaling molecules like the

298
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:56,799
endocannabinoids

299
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,399
phytocannabinoids like thc cbd serotonin

300
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,679
serotonin receptors all of these

301
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,759
um none of them are consciously aware

302
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,879
of things approaching or are not

303
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,958
approaching

304
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,639
everything is just happening based on a

305
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,359
chemical equilibrium

306
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,720
and everything actually in our whole

307
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,000
entire bodies

308
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,000
pretty much occurs due to forces of

309
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
enthalpy which is energy and entropy

310
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,039
which is like a measurement of disorder

311
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,720
and chaos

312
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,958
and right everything in the universe

313
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,759
tends towards disorder and chaos and

314
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,879
between those two you know factors it's

315
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,159
it's just like

316
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,240
whether or not something is

317
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,879
statistically likely to so occur

318
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,079
so the receptor is sitting there the

319
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,399
receptor is in the as

320
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,639
is in the membrane and it's empty and

321
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,320
it's you could say that it's waiting for

322
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,759
a molecule but really it's just kind of

323
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,600
floating around um

324
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,120
and then when you have thc molecules

325
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
floating around

326
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,839
at a certain concentration there will be

327
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,480
enough thc molecules present

328
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,680
that it will be you know energetically

329
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,278
favorable for it to bind to the receptor

330
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,958
and so that what i mentioned earlier

331
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,559
about the shape the charges

332
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,399
and the fatty velcro you know

333
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,359
hydrophobic interactions

334
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,200
those three things determine how

335
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,759
energetically favorable it is

336
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,399
so the affinity determines how little or

337
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,360
how much

338
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,720
you need of a certain drug to cause the

339
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,159
receptor to what you call

340
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,560
to get excited um because it's all

341
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,600
it's all based on whether or not it's

342
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,799
it's favorable

343
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,519
and these things are just kind of

344
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,000
floating around like waiting to interact

345
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,480
and whether

346
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,159
or not they interact depends entirely

347
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,000
upon how closely

348
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,480
they are shaped to one another and and

349
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,519
attract one another

350
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,079
so so the it's it's a

351
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,959
non-conscious thing that is looking to

352
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,719
continually

353
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:48,958
bring the energies into balance and so

354
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,120
it sounds like to a certain degree how

355
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,439
the the likelihood

356
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,480
of the receptor and the cannabinoid

357
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,760
interact

358
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,839
is a level of subtlety that that

359
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,958
might just be based on luck i mean not

360
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,279
to be

361
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,239
i mean it sounds like it takes a little

362
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,519
bit of luck they're going to put them

363
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
next to each other but we don't even

364
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,519
necessarily know if it that

365
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,278
if it's going to if they're going to

366
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,839
interact until they do

367
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,480
right so but rather than luck it's it's

368
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,440
based on

369
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,278
chemical affinity or properties so it's

370
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,160
not luck because the receptor

371
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,278
has a shape that happens to fit the

372
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,439
molecule very well

373
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,639
so if you think about it as like okay if

374
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,560
you and i if you and i

375
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,000
are like boats float we're in two boats

376
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,119
floating in the ocean and then there's

377
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,799
like

378
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,720
we're bumping into each other whether or

379
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,479
not the boats will stick to one another

380
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,399
depends on how strong

381
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
the magnets and velcro we have on the

382
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,958
outside of the the boats are to one

383
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,120
another right

384
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,159
um so it's it is exactly like you're

385
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,159
saying like

386
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,078
in luck in a certain sense people like

387
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,480
the the molecules are just kind of

388
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,078
floating around but whether or not it

389
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,120
chooses to interact and it's not

390
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,439
necessarily a choice

391
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,879
it depends upon how strongly they're

392
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,240
attracted to one another

393
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:03,039
um by these these chemical forces so

394
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,440
it's it's predetermined in some sense um

395
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,679
where

396
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,279
the more of a molecule you add to the

397
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,120
solution the more of them that are

398
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,639
present the higher the statistical

399
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,278
chance of the likelihood

400
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,839
um and it is exactly as you described

401
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:15,838
although i

402
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,519
i wouldn't say that it's luck i i would

403
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,880
say it's it's chemically and

404
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,600
energetically favorable

405
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,120
at that point uh i regretted using luck

406
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,320
as soon as i said it i'm like i'm

407
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,839
talking to a hard scientist

408
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,839
i mean i i get i get what you're saying

409
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,320
though it is it's not conscious though

410
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,480
which is

411
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,000
it is something amazing to think about

412
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,519
that you know if i go to snap

413
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,519
my fingers like you know i'm snapping

414
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,480
when i snap my fingers the chemical

415
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,639
reactions that

416
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,519
occur that allow me to snap those

417
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,360
fingers

418
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,879
at a certain point there is a conscious

419
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,759
thought that goes into beginning that

420
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,078
cascade

421
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,799
but all of the molecular interactions

422
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,239
that occur

423
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,039
are actually just energetically

424
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,959
favorable

425
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,198
[Laughter]

426
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,319
so far i'm glad that when we you know we

427
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,799
go to snap

428
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,720
the probabilities are that it happens

429
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,039
you know pretty much without fail

430
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,160
exactly and all of those probabilities

431
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,480
are predetermined

432
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,078
by our signaling systems and receptors

433
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,600
and i mean that's just how amazing it's

434
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,638
miraculous to me i mean

435
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,399
it's it's amazing that we can think

436
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,919
about snapping our fingers and that

437
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,198
you know for most of us and most of the

438
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,639
time if you want to snap your fingers

439
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,559
it'll just happen

440
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,839
so let's uh let's pull out a levels of

441
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,679
magnitude a little bit

442
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,600
so how many of these cannabinoid

443
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,599
receptors do we have in our body

444
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,120
because you know it's it's a lot of

445
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
people you know when i when i was

446
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
brought into cannabis medicine i was

447
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,959
taught

448
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,360
that um the number of receptors you have

449
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,719
are

450
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,680
not related to body weight um it has

451
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,560
everything to do with

452
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,159
your particular ability and likelihood

453
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,399
to grow more receptors

454
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,360
but more and more within dosing i'm

455
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,000
seeing from people

456
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,039
giving dosing recommendations based on

457
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
body weight

458
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,240
which as far as i'm aware doesn't match

459
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,120
the science as i learned it five six

460
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,440
years ago

461
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,360
so what is the state of the art now

462
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
about how many of these receptors we

463
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,079
have

464
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,439
and if there's any relationship to body

465
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,958
mass

466
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
so i don't i can't say this for absolute

467
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,039
fact but i

468
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,120
do not think that the number of

469
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,919
receptors are related to your your body

470
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
mass like

471
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,479
at all um and they they change all the

472
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,240
time that's another thing that we're not

473
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
like well aware of that we're still

474
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,720
figuring out is that there are a lot of

475
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
um interactions with our environment and

476
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,000
with our diet and

477
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,639
yes using cannabis that change the

478
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,360
density what's called a receptor density

479
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
for cb1 receptors and you know and also

480
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,839
something

481
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,278
you point out is how many how many

482
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,360
receptors do we have

483
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,198
normally we talk a lot about cb1

484
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,320
sometimes we'll talk about the cb2

485
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,879
receptor which

486
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,759
is generally uh attributed to the immune

487
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,240
system but

488
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,959
we rarely talk about the other receptors

489
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,720
beyond that

490
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,799
which you know there's there's multiples

491
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,320
and there's also receptors that we

492
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,319
originally classified

493
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,320
in different systems that interact with

494
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,920
the endocannabinoid system and

495
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,759
you know this is going to get a little

496
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,639
bit into the weeds here in terms like

497
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,560
separating out

498
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,560
different receptor types for for

499
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,239
specific purposes but

500
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,838
i personally don't believe that the

501
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,799
systems are separated

502
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,800
at all uh the endocannabinoid system is

503
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,240
integrally linked to the serotonin

504
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,399
system the dopamine system

505
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,639
all pretty the gaba system there's

506
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,480
actually an endocannabinoid

507
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,480
that is dopamine plus arachidonial

508
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,759
acid it's it's there's a there's a

509
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,560
serotonin um

510
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,440
arachneal amine to ethanol amine as well

511
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,838
i mean there's

512
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,440
those are like rare endocannabinoids and

513
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,360
we we don't research them as much as

514
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,440
we've researched or we we haven't

515
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,680
yet researched them as much as we've

516
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,720
researched um the other ones but

517
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:47,838
it also is fascinating because

518
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,600
the cb1 receptors and the cb2 receptors

519
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,720
have been shown to to dimerize which

520
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,360
means they bind

521
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,839
to receptors in other systems like for

522
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,278
the dopamine it'd be the d2 receptor

523
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,040
um and and it's been shown that if they

524
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,720
dimerize and if there's more than one

525
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,480
type of receptor that it will have a

526
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,078
different effect and so

527
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,919
we're still in the even though receptor

528
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,759
pharmacology has there's been a lot of

529
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,720
work and a lot of amazing progress i

530
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,798
still think we're

531
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,880
in the early you know in the early

532
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,038
stages of understanding these receptors

533
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,720
how they interact with each other um and

534
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:19,199
then to go further into your question

535
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,439
about

536
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,480
like dosing and and knowing how much is

537
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,240
good for someone i

538
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,160
really don't think that there's any way

539
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,558
to judge that from the outside

540
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,558
um i i can't think of any

541
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,558
way that you would know honestly other

542
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,480
than starting small

543
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,079
and starting with the least amount

544
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,200
possible and titrating up

545
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:44,798
slowly until you get your desired effect

546
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,919
um because everybody's so different

547
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,440
right yes exactly and especially with

548
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,960
the endocannabinoid system it's a

549
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,480
chicken or an egg

550
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,519
situation where since it's so connected

551
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,679
to the other

552
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,279
systems any change in any of those

553
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,080
systems will cause changes in the

554
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,119
endocannabinoid

555
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,599
system there is this theory it's a

556
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,038
theory

557
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,879
although i i believe there's a lot of

558
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,558
evidence for it um

559
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
that many of us have what's called

560
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,359
clinical endocannabinoid deficiency

561
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,279
which means that we have less

562
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,519
circulating endocannabinoids

563
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,678
which actually means we have more

564
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,720
cannabinoid receptors

565
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,519
um and this can cause a slew of problems

566
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
from like gi

567
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:29,038
issues mental health chronic pain

568
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,720
and it's you know it's still it's still

569
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,240
in the early stages to being

570
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,400
we're still early to being able to

571
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,038
understand all of this and how genetics

572
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
play

573
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,879
a role in into this um when we when we

574
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,080
had uh dr

575
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,919
russo on a few months back and well heck

576
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,119
probably three years back now we had him

577
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,120
on to talk about his

578
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,479
uh clinical endocannabinoid deficiency

579
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,759
paper and

580
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,200
um he talked about this this evolving

581
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,440
idea of the uh

582
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,480
uh endocannabinoid tone the cannabinoid

583
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
tone

584
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,640
and and he said at the time that you

585
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,400
know we weren't really sure

586
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,840
how we were going to measure it but but

587
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
people were starting to use this

588
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,558
vocabulary to talk about the

589
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,798
general i don't know veracity of the

590
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:12,879
endocannabinoids

591
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,879
present in the body you know whether you

592
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,200
had many or whether or not you had few

593
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,400
or

594
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,720
or whether or not your system was

595
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,559
sluggish but we haven't talked to him

596
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,000
about that in a long time and and i know

597
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,240
you're not dr rusdo

598
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,279
so i'm asking for your opinion not not

599
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,200
his of course

600
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,798
but um what are you seeing is the state

601
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,600
of the science because

602
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,480
you know you are you are a re you know a

603
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,599
more recent

604
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,519
phd and you are in the trenches doing

605
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,399
you know basic cannabinoid science every

606
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,240
day does this idea of the cannabinoid

607
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,360
tone is it is it still being

608
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,919
played with or have we moved past that i

609
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,678
mean

610
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,280
i believe that i have low

611
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,840
endocannabinoid tone

612
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,480
and i know other scientists who feel the

613
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:54,959
same way

614
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,558
i mean it's really there is no way of

615
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,079
clinically testing it yet

616
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,599
you know if i went to my doctor and i

617
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,038
asked hey can you check the level of my

618
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,879
endocannabinoids

619
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,079
um first of all they don't have you get

620
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,520
a blank stare

621
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,359
a test to do that but you know second of

622
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,119
all it's really really difficult to

623
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,678
measure the endocannabinoids because

624
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,399
they

625
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,519
um they degrade they oxidize really

626
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,679
really easily they're

627
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,798
it's it's difficult so there are many

628
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,519
reasons why

629
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,279
the endocannabinoid system has been um a

630
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,279
little bit sluggish in research behind

631
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,798
like other salt systems like serotonin

632
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,480
and dopamine are like salt based

633
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,960
systems you know you're cooking in the

634
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,960
kitchen it's easier to clean a glass

635
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
that had salt water in it than it is to

636
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,038
clean a glass that had like butter mixed

637
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,558
with maple syrup

638
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,079
and it's the same when you get to the

639
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,319
molecular scale

640
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,240
so if not if not maybe even a little bit

641
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,759
more difficult when things get sticky

642
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,000
um but in going back to the

643
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,879
endocannabinoid tone and the state of it

644
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,279
um i think that there is a lot more

645
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,400
research coming out like more recently

646
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,079
i've seen some more clinical data on

647
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,759
um you know different instances of

648
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,359
people with chronic health conditions

649
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,919
where they're finding hey

650
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,359
this has they have low endocannabinoids

651
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,480
like the ones that come to mind are

652
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,399
autism spectrum disorder and ptsd

653
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,558
both there have been clinical studies

654
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,559
for both of those populations that show

655
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,639
that you have a decreased amount of

656
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,879
circulating endocannabinoids

657
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,400
and with ptsd they've actually shown

658
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,799
that that either it's a chicken or an

659
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,880
egg

660
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,079
there's an increase in the number of cb1

661
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,600
receptors

662
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,798
and so in theory if you were

663
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,719
you know to have a clinical

664
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,000
endocannabinoid deficiency and like me

665
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,839
you know i'll just talk about myself i

666
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,679
believe i have low endocannabinoids i

667
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,639
don't i don't make enough of them

668
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,280
um and this is how cannabis helps me

669
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,038
because

670
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,918
the molecules in cannabis mimic the

671
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:44,480
endocannabinoids and so

672
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,799
i have a sub threat i have a low level

673
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,640
of endocannabinoids and it causes me

674
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:54,000
a myriad of symptoms really and if i

675
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,080
use cannabis products my body is feeling

676
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,558
like a restoration of balance

677
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,839
because even though i'm low in

678
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:02,079
endocannabinoids i'm giving my body

679
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,519
phytocannabinoids that restore that that

680
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,918
signaling i don't know if that does is

681
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:05,599
that

682
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,679
that makes sense yeah absolutely as a

683
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,798
matter of fact i would think that just

684
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,720
about everybody

685
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:14,158
is experiencing uh deficiency if you

686
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,120
look at what the general

687
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,000
causes are which are you know generally

688
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,918
you know stress

689
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,599
questionable stress sleep questionable

690
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,480
nutrition environmental

691
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,480
toxins and immune suppressing

692
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,440
pharmaceuticals i mean that's american

693
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
life

694
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,038
it's funny you mentioned nutrition

695
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,360
because the i mean the endocannabinoids

696
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,440
are

697
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:37,599
omega-6 fatty acids and yeah we often

698
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,919
we often don't think about how you know

699
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,959
pushing for a certain

700
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,480
you know high carb low fat diets

701
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,240
it would affect your endocannabinoid

702
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,960
tone i mean most

703
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,558
yeah i agree it's most people

704
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,519
potentially have a deficiency and the

705
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,960
only thing

706
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,720
to say though is that like you don't

707
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
know this right i mean this is the only

708
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,200
thing

709
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,479
left clinically is to to actually go in

710
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,319
there and figure it out and i think it's

711
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,000
it's in progress to and to go all the

712
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,798
way back to answering the question

713
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,038
um it is in progress and i i do believe

714
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:06,960
i

715
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,919
have spoken to many people who believe

716
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,960
that endocannabinoid deficiency is real

717
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,559
and so far in terms of like a theory and

718
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,840
calling it a theory

719
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:21,119
there hasn't been anything to refute it

720
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,199
um so that's important so here

721
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,119
around here we pretty much take it as

722
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,519
fact so it's interesting actually to

723
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,399
hear

724
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,839
you know um a frontline scientist like

725
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,600
you referring to it as a theory because

726
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,519
we're all like sold already you know so

727
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,158
yeah i mean yeah gravity

728
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,639
i mean gravity is a theory well good

729
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,640
point

730
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,480
so so let's talk you really attracted my

731
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,000
attention when you said that over the

732
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,400
course of our lives

733
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,079
the amount and sorts of receptors that

734
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
we have come and go

735
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,240
that's super interesting to me and then

736
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
the part that um you know you mentioned

737
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,359
that

738
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
the cannabinoids are are fatty acids and

739
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,639
um

740
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,359
last episode we had dr chris spooner on

741
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,600
and he was

742
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,558
encouraging everybody to take fish oil

743
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,798
supplements

744
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,319
as a way to support your endocannabinoid

745
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:04,879
system so i'm going to give you kind of

746
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,359
like a

747
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,400
a big big area question and you can take

748
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,678
it where you wish

749
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,278
i'm curious to know if our receptors

750
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,360
increase and decrease during our lives

751
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,558
are they is is this increase and

752
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,158
decrease more

753
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,759
related to well i guess i want to know

754
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,400
what factors are right is it

755
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,240
is it age is it diet is it everything

756
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,880
because most of us

757
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,359
want to i would think want to increase

758
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,679
the

759
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,959
number of receptors in our body so that

760
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,440
we can

761
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,079
process more cannabinoids for our

762
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
overall

763
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,158
health and so we would want to build

764
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,119
those up and if there are things that we

765
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,120
can do

766
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,959
or awarenesses we should have at times

767
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,399
of life that the the number of receptors

768
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,640
would go down that would probably be

769
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,480
good information for us to know

770
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,000
absolutely and i and i do want to point

771
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,440
out that for some people it would be

772
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,558
good to have your receptor levels

773
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,558
actually go down

774
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,079
which would be like making more

775
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:59,038
endocannabinoids it's all about a

776
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,960
balance

777
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,558
so you're trying to find you're trying

778
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,400
to find the right balance

779
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,558
and some of us have too many receptors

780
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,240
and some of us have not not enough

781
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,319
um and it's interesting about the

782
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,720
omega-3 for fish oil

783
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,759
supplements my my very first research

784
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,120
project ever

785
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:21,119
was looking at omega-3 and omega-6

786
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:23,278
dietary fatty acids in in mice um

787
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,278
and seeing like what changes that had on

788
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:29,119
on a cosinoids and which are downstream

789
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:31,119
of the endocannabinoids and i think

790
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,558
so in terms of what causes the changes

791
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:33,278
in receptor density i mean there's a

792
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:35,119
number of factors

793
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,640
age is certainly a factor i lean away

794
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,959
from just saying everything because

795
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,600
that's just a non-answer right

796
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,159
um but unfortunately it's pretty much

797
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,000
true

798
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,679
but i mean age is certainly a fast

799
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
factor because the endocannabinoid

800
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,679
system

801
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,319
is really important for a huge number of

802
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,038
very important processes right like the

803
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,519
the basic

804
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,158
the basic ones are metabolism immune

805
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,519
system

806
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,559
and inflammation and then overall brain

807
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,960
activity brain hyperactivity um so those

808
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,440
are really really important tasks and

809
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,038
they have different needs depending on

810
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,840
whether or not we're still growing as

811
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,599
we're children

812
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:16,240
as we you know as we age and mature um

813
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,119
so age is certainly a factor and and it

814
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,798
does change

815
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,359
the other factor that you mentioned

816
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,599
stress stress is a factor

817
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,119
um cortisol and elevated levels of

818
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,519
stress factors in the brain will change

819
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,278
it and

820
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,639
and this is where we we get into the

821
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,119
chicken and the egg

822
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,880
because it's hard to know whether like

823
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,158
whether the endocannabinoid system and

824
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,400
the dysregulation

825
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,240
of it is the source of the problem or

826
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,080
whether it's a symptom

827
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,240
however an unbalanced a quote-unquote

828
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,599
like unbalanced or dysregulated

829
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,079
endocannabinoid system

830
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,199
has been associated with almost every

831
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,000
single disorder

832
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,000
or pathology like i i don't think i can

833
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,159
think of a single one that hasn't been

834
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,919
associated with the endocannabinoid

835
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,520
system other than like genetic mutations

836
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,159
or genetic disorders

837
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,798
um that have a very clear like molecular

838
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,159
mechanism

839
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,519
and it's funny because that's kind of a

840
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,240
challenge right because it's great to

841
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,240
have this

842
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,558
one herb that can help us in so many

843
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,679
ways but it also has caused so many

844
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,839
people to say

845
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,000
oh what is with this cannabis medicine

846
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,079
they talk about it like it's a panacea

847
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,839
like it's like it solves everything and

848
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,278
and what i try to tell people is like no

849
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,759
it doesn't solve everything it just

850
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:23,599
solves

851
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,000
one thing but that one thing is the

852
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,240
endocannabinoid system and it touches

853
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,519
all the systems it makes it very hard

854
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,278
for people to believe

855
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,200
that's that's a great way of putting it

856
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,000
the way the way that i usually

857
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,278
explain it is that um you know the the

858
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,119
cannabinoids are really powerful

859
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:42,240
anti-inflammatories and it's my personal

860
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,839
belief that almost

861
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,919
all of these disorders come from like

862
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,879
dysregulations and in inflammation

863
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,799
and not not inflammation in terms of

864
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,520
like oh i sprained my ankle and now my

865
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,759
ankle has

866
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,240
swollen up and is inflamed but you know

867
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,640
at the cellular and molecular level

868
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,440
inflammation is just inflammatory

869
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,320
signaling

870
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,798
molecules um and like you said about

871
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,480
about

872
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,158
you know endocannabinoid tone being kind

873
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,839
of an american having low

874
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,640
endocannabinoid tone being an american

875
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,720
feature

876
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,080
there's there's a lot of evidence that

877
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,319
shows that having high

878
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,960
in systemic inflammation is is a problem

879
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,519
um and that we we don't really have any

880
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,519
way of of knowing or understanding

881
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,240
where we're at on our threshold until we

882
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,359
remove something right so it's like

883
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,839
like speaking from my personal

884
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,759
experience like i have a lot of

885
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,278
inflammation all the time stress causes

886
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,960
inflammation and then also like

887
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,919
chronic pain inflammation gi

888
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,640
inflammation um there's so many things

889
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,000
with which i think inflammation plays a

890
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,038
mechanistic factor

891
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,720
because it's i mean in terms of our

892
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,240
immune system

893
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,558
like what is inflammation at the

894
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,359
molecular level it really is

895
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,678
the most basic way that our body signals

896
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,879
to

897
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,240
itself hey something is wrong here like

898
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,320
if you think of it as like one cell

899
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,440
trying to talk to another cell in the

900
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,599
body

901
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,960
when it releases inflammatory like

902
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,879
inflammatory factors

903
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,558
it's trying this is one part of your

904
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,480
body one single cell

905
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,639
trying to tell the other part of your

906
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,000
body hey something's wrong here

907
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,840
um and so having super high levels of

908
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,240
inflammation causes just a

909
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,839
large number of problems and we often

910
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,200
get like desensitized to it because

911
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,398
we're just living

912
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,440
with systemically high inflammation

913
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,278
um and so when yes cannabis has um

914
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,880
like you know people are saying oh it's

915
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:35,519
a cure-all i do not believe it's a

916
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,960
cure-all

917
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,519
but i do believe that it's a powerful

918
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,798
anti-inflammatory and that

919
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:46,319
inflammation plays a crucial role in

920
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,240
most disorders and is really you know

921
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,759
not like underappreciated but it's just

922
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,919
that it's not really

923
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,599
talked about as inflammation because in

924
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,080
the general public when we think of

925
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:59,278
inflammation we think of like a swollen

926
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,359
lip or or a bruised ankle not the

927
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,480
signaling version of it

928
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,038
exactly uh and inflammation is probably

929
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,079
the most

930
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:11,038
basic cellular response to stress that

931
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,918
any type of of life has and that we

932
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:13,679
developed it's

933
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,000
it's part of what's called the uh the

934
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,200
innate immune system so like our immune

935
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,119
systems have two different

936
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,120
two different sides of it and

937
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,000
inflammation is the most basic side and

938
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,439
so

939
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,599
cannabis helps by being a powerful

940
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,120
anti-inflammatory

941
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:32,079
and there are so many symptoms

942
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,319
that are mechanistically related to

943
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,720
systemic inflammation

944
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,798
so if we we've so we've been talking

945
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,480
about how the endocannabinoid system is

946
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,158
actually integrated with all the systems

947
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,798
and i like what you said early on that

948
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,640
you know you

949
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,879
you actually see it all as one system

950
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,360
not really as discreet parts because

951
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,840
they're all

952
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,000
there's so much interplay and and in

953
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,599
passing we all just kind of say oh

954
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,759
you know the endocannabinoid system is

955
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,839
the body's homeostasis

956
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,519
uh device it's it you know if

957
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,599
something's running hot it cools it down

958
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,440
if something's sluggish it picks it up

959
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,199
well that's that's great as far as like

960
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,519
copywriting goes right

961
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,558
but what happens at uh at a more

962
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,640
chemical level like

963
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:16,639
like we did earlier on what what happens

964
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,000
that what is the method of action that

965
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,720
the endocannabinoid

966
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,119
system takes to create homeostasis

967
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,079
so i would say then to and it's

968
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,518
different in

969
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,038
different parts of the body in different

970
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,798
parts of the brain it could even be

971
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,000
different but the number one like most

972
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,038
generic way of describing

973
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,159
it would be that it it can

974
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:41,119
quiet like different

975
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,120
cells and it tells things to be quiet so

976
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,798
sometimes you hear people saying like oh

977
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:47,759
cannabis makes you slow or

978
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:50,000
cannabis reduces your brain activity um

979
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,398
you know technically that's true

980
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,159
but that's not always a bad thing

981
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:54,798
because sometimes there's too much brain

982
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,840
activity

983
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,519
and it's desirable to quiet

984
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,079
parts of the brain that are not supposed

985
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,919
to be speaking um so if you think about

986
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,759
the way that if we're talking about i'm

987
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,159
talking about signaling now from

988
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,480
one brain cell to another brain cell you

989
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,080
could think about it as a one-way street

990
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,759
or like have you ever played the game

991
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,278
telephone sure where

992
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,879
yeah where one person whispers in

993
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:17,359
someone's ear and then and so on and

994
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,840
it's

995
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,038
it's one direction um that's how

996
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,480
neurotransmitters

997
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,640
fire so they go from when you have one

998
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,000
they're like an end-to-end daisy chain

999
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,120
yes that's exactly

1000
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,278
the their end to end and you have one

1001
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,599
neuron and then you have what's called a

1002
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,038
synapse which is the place or the space

1003
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,678
between the neuron

1004
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,200
and then you have the the other end so

1005
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,559
you have a speaking neuron and a

1006
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,319
listening

1007
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,759
no does that make sense there's a

1008
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,158
talking a talking side

1009
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,200
and then a listening side um so the

1010
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,240
pre-synapse

1011
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,319
before is the talking side and the post

1012
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,759
synapse is the listening side

1013
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,158
and for all of the classic

1014
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,798
neurotransmitters they fire

1015
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,519
from the presynapse across the synapse

1016
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,000
to the

1017
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,519
postsynapse so they go from speaking

1018
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,159
side to listening side

1019
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,640
and the endocannabinoids are the only

1020
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,919
molecules that go the opposite direction

1021
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,480
and so the endocannabinoids are created

1022
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,720
in the postsynapse on the listening side

1023
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,319
and they transport across the synapse in

1024
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,200
what's called a retrograde

1025
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,240
fashion like opposite and they go to the

1026
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,159
pre-synapse

1027
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,919
so essentially if you have a long daisy

1028
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,640
chain if let's let's say

1029
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,519
in your telephone line of one-way daisy

1030
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,000
chains

1031
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,960
you have one telephone in there that's

1032
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,200
talking way too loud or way too much

1033
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,960
the only way for us to quiet it other

1034
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,640
than finding a way to go

1035
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,079
all the way around the daisy chain again

1036
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,440
to quiet it is through the

1037
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,119
endocannabinoid system

1038
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,480
which talks in the opposite direction

1039
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:52,239
and says hey like

1040
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,200
can you just be quiet and and what is

1041
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,038
scent

1042
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,880
what what is actually sent is that a

1043
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,278
particular chemical that's sent

1044
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,960
upstream and that endocannabinoid oh

1045
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:01,519
this is the endocannabinoid itself and

1046
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,880
so

1047
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,519
then it goes and it will interact with a

1048
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,200
receptor there and then and then

1049
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,878
depending on the nature of how it's

1050
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,279
talking it'll either be a

1051
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:14,639
agonist or antagonist or a would you say

1052
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,320
reverse agonist

1053
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,960
inverse agonist so all the all the

1054
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,200
endocannabinoids are

1055
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,960
um some not all of them but the main

1056
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,118
ones anandamide and 2hg

1057
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,800
are agonist partial agonists at the at

1058
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,039
the cannabinoid receptors

1059
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,119
so if we're going back to the the

1060
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,838
pre-synapse and post-synapse the talking

1061
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,240
and the listening

1062
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:36,078
end you have the endocannabinoids they

1063
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,239
get created on the listening end

1064
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,440
and then the receptors are on the

1065
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,519
talking end so they

1066
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,119
are being transported across the synapse

1067
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,599
they bind to the receptors and they

1068
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,800
activate them and when you activate the

1069
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,440
cannabinoid receptors

1070
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,440
it activates this very specific g

1071
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,679
protein that is inhibitory

1072
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,358
and that g protein follows the signaling

1073
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,160
cascade that ultimately

1074
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,039
it changes the voltage all of all of our

1075
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,279
cells have

1076
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,440
a voltage potential it's like an it's an

1077
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,480
electrical potential to fire

1078
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,920
so if you think about it like whether or

1079
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,079
not a brain cell let's say this brain

1080
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,280
cell is firing way too often

1081
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,519
if you then synthesize the

1082
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,200
endocannabinoids

1083
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,920
and then they activate the cannabinoid

1084
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:20,639
receptors the cannabinoid receptors will

1085
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,079
change the voltage of that entire cell

1086
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:26,319
so that it's less likely

1087
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,839
to fire i follow this

1088
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,359
so and yeah please ask please ask me a

1089
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:34,159
question i'm just catching up so so

1090
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:34,559
and because it's less likely to fire

1091
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,598
that

1092
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:40,078
is its response to the up chain

1093
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,960
saying shh like don't talk so much

1094
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,359
that's really great

1095
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,079
you know me not miyabi i really and

1096
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,239
there's actually

1097
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,680
liberation in this information i can't

1098
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,239
be the only one listening to you going

1099
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,719
oh my god i've wondered this for so long

1100
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,799
but most people are most people don't

1101
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,838
have this education

1102
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,960
uh and and to have it be so

1103
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:03,440
contemporary that they can speak to us

1104
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,880
in this level of detail so this is this

1105
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,960
is really fantastic

1106
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,559
um so thank you and we are going to go

1107
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,720
ahead and take our first break

1108

shaping fire i am your host

1291
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,240
shango los and our guest this week is

1292
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,199
cannabis scientist and educator miyabi

1293
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,279
shields

1294
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,960
so during the first set we were talking

1295
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,519
about the endocannabinoid

1296
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,720
system itself the the system of

1297
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,639
receptors

1298
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,078
and and how they work to keep our body

1299
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,159
in homeostasis

1300
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,200
um clearly we could have continued on

1301
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,199
that topic and it's

1302
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,799
so fascinating but we're gonna shift a

1303
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,279
little bit during second set

1304
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,920
and focus on individual cannabinoids

1305
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,599
because

1306
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,280
since most of what we try to learn here

1307
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,599
on shaping fire are things that we can

1308
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,519
use either for our own health or

1309
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,359
or in the you know the for the health of

1310
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,759
the people that we are we love

1311
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,559
um you know we try to keep things very

1312
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,560
um

1313
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,078
um very usable very actionable

1314
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,880
information so let's let's start talking

1315
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,599
about individual

1316
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,440
uh cannabinoids so miyabi you know most

1317
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,960
of us have seen the chart

1318
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,519
um showing how cannabinoids degrade

1319
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,480
from starting as cbg or cbn and then

1320
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,039
degrading

1321
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,559
down into other cannabinoids when

1322
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:15,759
exposed to

1323
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:18,078
time or heat i believe it is so

1324
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,440
it's not really usually explained why

1325
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,200
though um

1326
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,519
and you know i've seen on your tic toc

1327
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,399
many times you play with the molecular

1328
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,318
models

1329
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,599
and i know you've got an intimate

1330
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:29,440
understanding of this so

1331
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,519
if you'd walk us through it what is

1332
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,880
happening and why is it happening at the

1333
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,880
chemical level

1334
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,240
all right so we're gonna basically go

1335
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,559
all the way back and just talk about how

1336
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,399
that

1337
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,000
everything in the universe i mentioned

1338
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,358
earlier that in in the body

1339
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,838
everything comes down to a chemical

1340
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,119
equilibrium but actually this applies to

1341
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,960
everything in the entire

1342
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,160
universe pretty much although i'm not

1343
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,159
sure about

1344
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,879
i'm not sure if you go way out into

1345
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,759
space if that applies but um

1346
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,039
but pretty much everything comes down to

1347
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,480
basically

1348
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:02,800
energy and entropy so the reason

1349
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,119
why these molecules degrade is because

1350
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,599
if you leave them open to oxygen

1351
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,440
so let's let me back up if you were to

1352
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,640
have the molecules by themselves

1353
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,240
like in a complete vacuum and and or you

1354
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:17,519
can add what we call like an

1355
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:20,078
inert gas which is like argon or helium

1356
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:22,239
it's it's a gas that is non-reactive

1357
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,599
um if you were to have the molecule and

1358
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:27,279
it were to be kept

1359
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,920
in the dark in some either a vacuum or

1360
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,519
a gas that's non-volatile and if it were

1361
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,280
to be kept very very cold

1362
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,000
like as cold as you possibly could keep

1363
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,040
it um it in theory

1364
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,920
would be stable that way forever the

1365
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,400
only reason

1366
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,720
why things degrade with heat light and

1367
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,960
exposure to air and oxygen

1368
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,719
is because even though we see air around

1369
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,358
us and we don't think anything of it

1370
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:53,039
there's a lot of of things floating

1371
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,920
around in the air mostly oxygen and

1372
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,679
nitrogen

1373
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,200
um and some other forms like carbon

1374
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,838
dioxide and

1375
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,679
and other depending on where you are and

1376
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:04,318
what what's in your air right

1377
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,000
um but you know you heard that um the

1378
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:07,679
story where it's like hey you asked the

1379
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,800
fish how's the water and the fish goes

1380
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,679
like what's water

1381
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,280
yeah um we're pretty much the same way

1382
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,719
with air so we don't really think too

1383
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,280
much about it but there's plenty of

1384
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:17,118
things

1385
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,040
in air that when you expose them over

1386
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,640
time will will come to

1387
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,119
have a chemical reaction with these

1388
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,318
molecules um and the cannabinoids are

1389
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,880
quite stable

1390
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,920
but there are certain areas of of it

1391
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,240
that are prone to

1392
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,159
oxidation that's the main chemical

1393
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,919
reaction that occurs

1394
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,279
and then slowly from there things will

1395
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,720
continue to break down because

1396
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,319
oxygen is pretty reactive um in terms of

1397
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,799
like the types of

1398
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,519
of molecule or the types of atoms that

1399
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,680
you introduce

1400
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:47,440
it introduces charges whenever you have

1401
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,279
charges around they're likely to

1402
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,400
interact with other charges

1403
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,480
um and that's that's the reason so the

1404
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,280
reason why it occurs is just that it's

1405
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,480
it's chemically favorable um so that's

1406
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,760
another reason why if you he

1407
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,519
if you heat things you're giving them

1408
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,240
energy and it just happens faster

1409
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:04,800
so the reason why heat is a factor is

1410
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,159
just because

1411
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,920
it adds energy into the system

1412
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,759
exactly for this thing to occur that

1413
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,400
would have occurred regardless

1414
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,760
um and yeah there's i guess if you look

1415
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,519
at a molecule

1416
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,440
there are certain areas of certain

1417
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,559
molecules that are more vulnerable

1418
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,519
to degradation or to like an attack of

1419
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,838
of an outside

1420
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,440
molecule and all of these things depend

1421
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:30,960
on how these atoms are

1422
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,400
linked together and how stable that link

1423
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,519
is to one another because if you think

1424
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,960
about it um if you

1425
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:36,559
have seen my videos and you see the

1426
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,760
molecules are held together by these

1427
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,318
little plastic

1428
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,480
um you know they're just bonded together

1429
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,119
by these little plastic strings

1430
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,719
in my model all of those pieces of

1431
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,039
plastic look the same

1432
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,480
but in real life they're all different

1433
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,119
um and they're they're different

1434
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,519
strengths

1435
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,760
like some of the atoms are held together

1436
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:58,880
by a fishing line and others are held

1437
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,200
together by steel poles

1438
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,640
so so different cannabinoids have got

1439
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,000
their weak spot where they're at the

1440
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,000
most risk

1441
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,199
yep and that that will change when you

1442
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,559
once you introduce

1443
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,279
a you oxidize it then everything changes

1444
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,119
again

1445
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,040
um and that's one of the things i found

1446
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,079
so fascinating about chemistry

1447
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:20,159
um in the beginning is just this crazy

1448
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,280
crazy amount of versatility that small

1449
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:23,358
small changes

1450
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,480
in molecular structure cause giant

1451
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,679
changes um

1452
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,760
you know downstream so

1453
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,118
let's talk about the the time of

1454
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,280
efficacy for

1455
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,838
um you know two of our most favorite

1456
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,519
cannabinoids uh thc and cbd

1457
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:43,199
so excuse me so for

1458
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:46,239
for caregivers everywhere we're often

1459
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:49,279
trying to explain to our patient

1460
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:51,279
um you know the time frame that they're

1461
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,160
going to get relief

1462
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,359
and you know most most cannabis patients

1463
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:56,639
especially at the beginning they don't

1464
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,400
have a really good understanding of the

1465
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,118
endocannabinoid system

1466
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,880
and honestly most caregivers even the

1467
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,160
ones with their heart in the right place

1468
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,680
might not have that great of an

1469
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:06,399
understanding of the endocannabinoid

1470
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,318
system

1471
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,559
they just know how to apply the medicine

1472
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,880
in ways that tend to get relief and for

1473
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,760
that

1474
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,160
everyone is grateful however you know

1475
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,440
there

1476
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:20,000
are faster acting cannabinoids and there

1477
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,679
are there seem to be slower action of

1478
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,119
the cannabinoids as well

1479
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,279
and i'm going to give you an example

1480
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,920
that's pretty common for caregivers to

1481
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,359
talk about

1482
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,119
which i'm open to the possibility that

1483
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:30,880
this is not true right so

1484
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,200
you don't have to defend my position if

1485
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,920
this is wrong like call it out but

1486
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,960
very often when we talk about cbd people

1487
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,639
talk about

1488
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,800
benefits that you get now and benefits

1489
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,679
you get later for example

1490
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,079
if you are having you know an anxious

1491
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:46,879
day

1492
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,039
full of rumination you can take some you

1493
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,760
know whole plant cbd

1494
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,960
and you know something with cbd dominant

1495
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,520
and it will

1496
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,960
um you know have a tendency to correct

1497
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:00,159
the balance of chemicals

1498
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,960
and or um you know hit the receptors

1499
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,838
that that

1500
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,720
that decrease your experience of

1501
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:08,239
dysphoria

1502
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:10,159
of anxiety so so so that would be your

1503
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,879
benefit potentially today

1504
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,440
but over the long term for example after

1505
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,079
somebody

1506
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,358
has been taking cbd for you know four or

1507
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,039
six weeks

1508
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:21,119
i'll often hear back from them and

1509
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:25,279
they'll say oh yeah you know i

1510
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,960
um i started taking cbd for my migraines

1511
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,920
uh but then the diarrhea that i've had

1512
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,800
for three years uh cleared up and and i

1513
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,280
explained to them

1514
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,240
you know in layman's terms that one of

1515
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,800
the properties

1516
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:37,439
of a strong endocannabinoid system is

1517
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,079
that the

1518
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,240
the system goes through and does uh

1519
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,039
housekeeping like cleaning the cilia in

1520
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:45,199
the gut

1521
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:47,119
of of the mucus and so there's there's

1522
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,439
essentially gifts with purchase when you

1523
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,358
when you take cbd things that you never

1524
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,760
intended but which are totally great to

1525
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,078
have

1526
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,240
so um um i'm very open to the

1527
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,119
possibility that there's scientific mess

1528
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:59,759
in that example miyabi so so so feel

1529
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,358
free to

1530
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,680
you know correct me but but essentially

1531
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:06,558
the part i'm trying to get at is

1532
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,118
cannabinoid seems to have help now and

1533
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,319
help

1534
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:12,318
later how does how

1535
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,239
what's up with that from your viewpoint

1536
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:17,119
as a scientist

1537
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:17,519
so i would say that first of all that

1538
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,160
it's

1539
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,759
not it's absolutely not a pseudoscience

1540
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,039
and that it's definitely true

1541
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,599
that there are different types of

1542
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,838
effects that are separated so

1543
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,200
help now would be what you would call an

1544
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:30,558
acute effect

1545
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,598
that's something that's happening

1546
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,480
immediately so we're gonna use cbd as

1547
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,039
the example

1548
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,599
um cbd actually has very low affinity

1549
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,719
for

1550
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,318
the cb1 and cb2 receptors but it has

1551
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:45,039
been shown to be what's called

1552
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:45,920
an allosteric modulator at the cb1

1553
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:47,679
receptor which is

1554
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,838
just a fancy way for saying it like

1555
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,879
binds to a different location

1556
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:56,239
um but let's use cbd as an example

1557
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,318
so the acute effect of cbd is when you

1558
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,078
are actually taking the cbd

1559
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:02,079
and like it happens within like let's

1560
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,200
say if you take it if you take it orally

1561
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,760
like in a tincture

1562
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:06,799
or an edible um you know it takes 45

1563
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,040
minutes to an hour

1564
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,960
and then like maybe it lasts like two

1565
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,639
hours maybe four hours

1566
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,480
that those effects that you feel right

1567
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:16,879
then are acute effects

1568
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,719
so that's the effect of the molecule

1569
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,358
binding to the outside of the cb1

1570
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,039
receptor

1571
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:22,639
and it actually decreases the cb1

1572
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,039
receptors activity

1573
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:25,920
um that would be an acute effect the

1574
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,000
help later

1575
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,280
that you described help now being acute

1576
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,599
effect help later

1577
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,119
is what's called a it's like a a

1578
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,720
longer-term effect

1579
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,880
um this actually comes from how our body

1580
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:40,159
restructures itself our body does

1581
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,400
housekeeping like you mentioned the

1582
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,480
endocannabinoid system does housekeeping

1583
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,318
um our body goes through all of its

1584
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,960
systems and does housekeeping

1585
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,318
pretty much you're in a constant state

1586
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,920
of managing

1587
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,440
what is happening now and what's going

1588
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,680
to happen in the future

1589
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,358
and what your body does when let's say

1590
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,118
you're taking a little bit of cbd i take

1591
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:02,078
a bit of cbd every day

1592
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,720
and what my body has done over time it

1593
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,839
is it is

1594
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,759
it's responded to that happening so i

1595
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:09,679
get the acute effects

1596
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,599
from taking cbd every day but then

1597
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:12,399
there's also these secondary long-term

1598
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,318
effects that

1599
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,160
happen later which is your body

1600
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:18,000
restructuring and changing certain

1601
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,039
levels of receptors

1602
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,440
and changing certain levels of

1603
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:23,759
endocannabinoids and

1604
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,358
other like highly likely other signaling

1605
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,160
molecules like serotonin

1606
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:29,679
um and actually this may seem like a

1607
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:31,440
little bit like scary that there's these

1608
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,919
two types of effects but

1609
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,559
that's pretty much the entire premise of

1610
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,639
like

1611
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:40,400
ssris and anti like you know mood mood

1612
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,480
stabilizing medications

1613
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,639
many of those also function in the same

1614
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,679
way where they take a few weeks

1615
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,480
to to see actually whether or not

1616
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,318
they're going to

1617
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,519
you know have have a beneficial effect

1618
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,159
because they work on this

1619
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,280
what is a secondary mechanism um that's

1620
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:58,399
a longer term thing

1621
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,079
so our bodies do these things so

1622
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,519
every single receptor when it's when

1623
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,760
it's activated

1624
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,358
um will eventually go through a process

1625
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,839
to to inactivate it

1626
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,838
part of this is our body takes it it's

1627
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:10,558
called endocytosis and our body like

1628
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:12,078
recycles

1629
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,640
the receptors you could think about it

1630
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,318
as like a recycling program

1631
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:18,879
and if you think about it as a recycling

1632
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:20,000
program every time our body recycles

1633
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,160
these receptors

1634
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,880
it's kind of like counting and taking

1635
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:28,960
into account how many of each type

1636
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:31,200
is being recycled then it will adjust

1637
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,920
the amount that it creates like in in

1638
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:33,919
response to that

1639
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:37,440
that's that's incredible it's it's it's

1640
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:39,199
it's um

1641
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,119
i mean i know we don't want to put too

1642
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,399
much consciousness into these processes

1643
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,800
but it's like a thinking machine it's

1644
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,039
self

1645
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,960
it's self calibrating based on what our

1646
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:50,318
body needs and i love that

1647
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,760
oh absolutely i mean yeah it's between

1648
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:53,358
knowing that things are happening

1649
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,000
completely

1650
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:57,519
like based on just chance or luck as you

1651
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,159
put it earlier but as i was putting it

1652
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,199
chemical

1653
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:02,719
like chemical affinity and energy

1654
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,199
everything is happening based on that

1655
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:05,279
but it's

1656
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,039
it's this magical combination that is

1657
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,119
quite conscious i mean there is

1658
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,159
the reason why this is happening is to

1659
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,720
try and keep us

1660
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:14,078
well and to try to keep us alive and and

1661
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,719
functioning

1662
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,760
and life is miraculous in that way

1663
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:19,598
before we move on

1664
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,040
i want to hit on one more example of

1665
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,920
this acute versus

1666
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:25,039
longer term uh impacts and let's talk

1667
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,280
about thc

1668
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,679
with inflammation since you sound like

1669
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:34,000
you're very deep on inflammation as well

1670
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:36,000
so we talk about thc being useful

1671
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,760
both in the moment acutely for

1672
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,119
inflammation pain

1673
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,000
and then long term for inflammation as

1674
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,798
well

1675
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,480
and for lack of having heard a better

1676
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:48,159
explanation how i normally

1677
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,519
ask how i normally explain it to

1678
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,920
patients when they stop me

1679
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,880
like after a talk or something i'll say

1680
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,760
well you know

1681
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:59,358
if you take uh thc now even at

1682
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:03,520
subperceptual doses

1683
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:06,798
you are decreasing uh

1684
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:09,039
some inflammation now but even more so

1685
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:11,519
you're decreasing your experience of the

1686
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,039
pain that comes from inflammation now

1687
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:14,880
which makes you feel like you have less

1688
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,759
inflammation but then

1689
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,079
if you keep on taking thc every three or

1690
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,559
four

1691
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:24,240
hours the natural anti-inflammation

1692
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:26,400
characteristics of thc

1693
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,439
keep on for lack of a better term

1694
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,240
beating down

1695
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,960
on the inflammation and or or shushing i

1696
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,399
guess

1697
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,679
you know telling telling those receptors

1698
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,318
to be quiet

1699
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,118
and and then over time the inflammation

1700
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,558
goes down

1701
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,960
because those cells are not yelling as

1702
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,680
much

1703
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,119
that there is a problem so i don't know

1704
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,598
if that's the correct science but there

1705
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:53,039
does seem to be this dichotomy between

1706
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:56,160
thcs helping an inflammation patient

1707
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,759
now in the next three hours versus a

1708
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,719
month from now when they've been taking

1709
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,359
thc

1710
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,078
all that time and they're all like gosh

1711
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,358
you know my

1712
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,359
my arthritis is significantly improved

1713
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:09,440
oh absolutely one of i guess what i

1714
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,759
would say this has to do with is that

1715
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,639
inflammation is like a threshold or an

1716
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,680
exponential

1717
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:18,798
response where you feel pain

1718
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,879
above a certain threshold right um of

1719
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:21,358
inflammation and your body responds to

1720
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,358
that

1721
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,119
by firing like let's just call it like a

1722
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:25,838
pain signaling it's like a it's like a

1723
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,680
chain

1724
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:29,920
depending on where your inflammation is

1725
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,960
so actually rheumatoid arthritis runs in

1726
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,358
my family

1727
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,880
and i wake up with stiff fingers all the

1728
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:38,639
time right now

1729
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,318
um and the pain would originate

1730
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,558
in the nerves in my hand so the

1731
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:45,119
inflammation originates in your hand

1732
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,240
and but you actually feel the pain in

1733
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,920
your brain

1734
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:51,759
right so it it's true that they have

1735
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,159
anti-inflammatory properties it's

1736
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,920
also true that if you reduce

1737
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:57,118
inflammation and you decrease the amount

1738
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,200
of pain that you feel

1739
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,039
overall that you're decreasing the

1740
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:04,399
strength of the pathway

1741
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:06,159
of pain which is something that's um

1742
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,318
you know it's difficult it's a difficult

1743
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,639
topic and it's difficult to prove

1744
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:12,079
but there's this saying that that people

1745
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,598
neuroscientists say it all the time

1746
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,519
you say i don't know if you've heard it

1747
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,798
but it's neurons that fire together wire

1748
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,199
together

1749
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,079
that's this is the this is the saying

1750
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,159
because

1751
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,318
when you have brain cells that are in a

1752
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:27,440
circuit and they're used to firing

1753
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:29,119
in this circuit they become stronger so

1754
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,200
actually if you think about them as like

1755
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:33,358
roads uh if you imagine

1756
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,719
like when you're if your brain is

1757
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:37,039
totally naive

1758
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,798
it's like a desert or an area and

1759
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:40,159
there's there's no roads there's no

1760
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:41,838
point from a to b

1761
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:43,358
so everything's just a dirt path you

1762
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,838
start making the dirt paths

1763
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:46,480
but then over time you start using this

1764
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:48,400
one path

1765
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,838
more and more and more let's say that's

1766
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,559
the pathway for

1767
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,480
inflammatory pain right your body

1768
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,119
becomes really sensitized to that path

1769
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,798
because

1770
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,720
you're using it so much that it's not a

1771
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:01,280
dirt road anymore it turns into

1772
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,078
a street that then turns into a major

1773
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,760
highway

1774
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,920
that then turns it turns into the

1775
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:09,520
fastest route of signaling

1776
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,680
and our our brain cells are like that so

1777
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:14,159
when they fire together they wire

1778
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,358
together more tightly and it's easier

1779
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:18,159
for them to go down

1780
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,119
these pathways um and so it's

1781
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:21,039
interesting

1782
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,400
specifically with pain it's so difficult

1783
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,400
to piece apart

1784
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,240
whether or not it's inflammation

1785
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,680
certainly but also whether it's it's a

1786
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:30,558
sensitization

1787
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,239
to your body even even feeling pain um

1788
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,960
and this is i don't have the answers

1789
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:37,199
for this either this is just you know me

1790
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,199
talking out loud thinking about

1791
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,118
inflammation and and how people feel

1792
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,798
inflammation and pain because

1793
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,358
like from from my perspective i have

1794
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:48,079
chronic joint pain i have a lot of

1795
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:50,000
form i have a lot of injuries um that

1796
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,880
i've been told that these injuries

1797
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,280
are the cause of my pain but i've also

1798
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,680
had

1799
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,519
a lot of scans and things where i didn't

1800
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:58,399
disclose to anyone that i had prior

1801
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:00,880
injuries and

1802
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,920
no one can see anything structurally

1803
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,200
wrong

1804
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,960
um with any and any part of it um and

1805
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,558
there's this there's this piece that i

1806
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,880
guess you cannot prove

1807
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,519
which is where is the sensitivity like

1808
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,280
where is the sensitization to pain

1809
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:17,039
part of it is in the inflammatory

1810
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,519
factors which is the acute effect which

1811
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:19,920
you were

1812
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:20,559
saying part of it is that that first

1813
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,480
effect

1814
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,480
which is that there are inflammatory

1815
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,480
factors there and that cannabis can help

1816
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,000
by reducing that inflammation

1817
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,599
and then the second part of it is

1818
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,960
breaking the cycle

1819
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:35,119
of firing your pain cells all the time

1820
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,639
or your pain signaling pathway all the

1821
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,960
time because like

1822
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:40,159
the less than your body uses that

1823
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,720
pathway

1824
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,399
the less likely it will be to sort of

1825
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,399
follow down that pathway

1826
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,680
you know i've been talking a lot about

1827
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,920
just like entropy

1828
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:51,199
and chemical like statistical chance of

1829
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,039
something happening and

1830
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:54,719
and everything in the body just runs

1831
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,358
downhill

1832
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,719
so meaning like the easiest path forward

1833
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:00,639
yes

1834
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:03,199
and if it's the easiest path for your

1835
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:05,759
body to feel pain because your body has

1836
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,480
been in pain for years and years and

1837
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,880
years

1838
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,599
it will be difficult to break that cycle

1839
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,079
without

1840
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,440
removing the pain and then there's

1841
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,440
obviously the fact that some

1842
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,880
there are some aspects of pain that are

1843
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,639
structural that are caused that the

1844
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,760
cannabinoids can only help so much with

1845
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:20,558
right like if you have a nerve

1846
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,559
impingement

1847
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,839
or something that's actually like

1848
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,000
causing like a physical cause

1849
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:27,358
yeah something that's mechanically wrong

1850
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,760
um but i think uh

1851
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,598
for from from my opinion a big piece of

1852
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,839
the long-term benefits of cannabis for

1853
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,480
chronic pain is breaking this cycle

1854
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,480
and also in what i mentioned earlier in

1855
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,519
the in the quieting or the shushing

1856
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,358
of the cells because some of us are are

1857
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:46,079
hypersensitive to a lot i mean i'm

1858
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,039
i'm hypersensitive to a lot of stimuli

1859
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,440
not just

1860
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:51,599
not just pain but other types of things

1861
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,920
too right like auditory stimuli or

1862
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,039
like certain types of like tactile

1863
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,480
feelings

1864
01:00:55,039 --> 01:01:00,960
and you know we we don't know

1865
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,599
between between person to person it you

1866
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,358
can't tell

1867
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:06,480
what what someone's threshold for pain

1868
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:09,598
is because pain is completely subjective

1869
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,719
you know we we can only feel what we

1870
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,519
feel

1871
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:14,879
in in our bodies which is why those pain

1872
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:17,440
charts are always so

1873
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,440
unsatisfying you know i feel seven today

1874
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,599
or six or sometimes they show

1875
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,679
you know uh stick drawing faces it's

1876
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,039
like oh gosh this is a fool's errand

1877
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,440
from the beginning

1878
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:29,599
right and as speaking from someone who's

1879
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,400
pretty much lived like my entire life at

1880
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,599
like a five

1881
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,599
or above like at a at a certain point it

1882
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,559
just starts becoming like a status quo

1883
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,760
and your body

1884
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:41,440
actually your body actually can

1885
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,040
think of it that way if that if that

1886
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,079
makes sense like your body gets into

1887
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,599
these patterns

1888
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,400
that it will perpetuate um and i think

1889
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:50,318
that

1890
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,760
in some ways that's that's a way that

1891
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:54,079
the cannabinoids can help is by

1892
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,680
decreasing that that sensitivity

1893
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,280
um and then there's there's another

1894
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,679
follow-up piece which is that

1895
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,280
the cannabinoids and the metabolites so

1896
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,159
we talked about thc and you mentioned

1897
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,920
that like you know

1898
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,159
if there's an onset of action and then

1899
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,358
it's metabolized by the body

1900
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:12,399
and it's it is sequestered away

1901
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,920
in our fat and it gets stored in our fat

1902
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,039
and that's that's one of the reasons why

1903
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,760
you can test positive

1904
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,799
on a on a drug test for weeks and weeks

1905
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,280
afterwards

1906
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:22,480
um is because our body still is

1907
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,000
processing and releasing these

1908
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,838
metabolites so

1909
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,838
if you're using over a longer course of

1910
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:29,838
time then you have a build up

1911
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,199
of these metabolites um it's something

1912
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:32,078
called like the depot effect it's

1913
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,399
actually

1914
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,079
um something that is harnessed for other

1915
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,760
medications like birth control is the

1916
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,880
first one that comes to mind

1917
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,599
um utilizes the depot effect for like a

1918
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,200
long-term

1919
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,240
release essentially um so that's a whole

1920
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:48,078
nother mechanism

1921
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:50,078
in which like a long-term effect of of

1922
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,280
cannabis can can build up and be slowly

1923
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,359
released because

1924
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,640
even though those metabolites are not

1925
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,480
psychoactive

1926
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:59,159
it doesn't mean that they're not still

1927
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,199
circulating at low levels causing like

1928
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:04,399
anti-inflammatory effects

1929
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:06,639
um and that's something that i think is

1930
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,160
is possible but to my knowledge i don't

1931
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,159
know if either of those things

1932
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,358
have been like proven right on i follow

1933
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:13,199
that so

1934
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:14,480
let's talk about tolerance breaks for a

1935
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:16,639
moment so

1936
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,798
we understand that tolerance breaks are

1937
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:21,118
are good so that we can increase our

1938
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:23,599
sensitivity to cannabinoids

1939
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,280
um and we also know that anybody who

1940
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,039
works with patients knows that

1941
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,640
trying to convince a patient to go on a

1942
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,680
tolerance break is very difficult

1943
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:31,440
because

1944
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:33,279
if you know for a lot of people they get

1945
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,200
to cannabis last

1946
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,039
and then when it works they're all like

1947
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:38,798
well none of the pharma works without

1948
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,079
terrible side effects and they hold on

1949
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,159
to cannabis so dearly

1950
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,000
now we're telling them to you know take

1951
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:47,679
two three seven days off

1952
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:50,480
which seems unreal and i think every

1953
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:51,118
all of us who work with patients would

1954
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,358
would be

1955
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,400
served by having a better understanding

1956
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:56,558
of what

1957
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,280
happens at a chemical level during a

1958
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:03,200
tolerance break so that we can make it

1959
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,720
more you know more real more mechanical

1960
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:05,919
for the patient that we're trying to

1961
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:08,239
encourage to

1962
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,519
give up their most effective medication

1963
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,358
for a few days

1964
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:13,679
so will you go through what happens in

1965
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:16,480
our body during a tolerance break

1966
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:16,960
yep absolutely so when when you are

1967
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,358
using

1968
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,440
cannabis regularly and so i i use

1969
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:22,798
cannabis regularly and i regularly take

1970
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:26,159
tolerance breaks

1971
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:28,960
um and when you're using it regularly

1972
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,879
what your body does have a compensatory

1973
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,358
reaction which is what i was describing

1974
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:36,480
earlier is it it decreases the level

1975
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:37,038
of cb1 receptors that are present and

1976
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,480
this is

1977
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,079
kind of an oversimplification

1978
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,400
simplification because there are other

1979
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,119
changes that occur too but for the most

1980
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,200
part

1981
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,160
when you have that decrease in cb1

1982
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,558
receptors

1983
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:49,199
you notice it because you have to

1984
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,359
increase

1985
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:52,960
the amount of cannabis that you use to

1986
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:56,000
get the same effect

1987
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,838
right and this is at the this is kind of

1988
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,880
at the crutch of of tolerance

1989
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:03,358
is you your body has

1990
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,318
less and less cb1 receptors and actually

1991
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,400
you know i

1992
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:08,000
personally believe that a certain level

1993
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,960
of tolerance is beneficial for

1994
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
me i maintain a low level of tolerance

1995
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,519
like i never

1996
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,280
i never take a tolerance break to

1997
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:17,358
completely re-sensitize

1998
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,960
because if i completely re-sensitize my

1999
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:20,880
body goes a hundred percent

2000
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,639
the opposite direction and it makes way

2001
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,119
too many cb1 receptors

2002
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:26,558
so essentially when you're talking to or

2003
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,920
what would be my opinion if i was

2004
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,039
talking to cannabis patients about

2005
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,079
tolerance breaks and why they're

2006
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,079
necessary

2007
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,760
it's because you're trying to balance

2008
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,760
the endocannabinoid system

2009
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,880
and when you use cannabis every day

2010
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,559
you're constantly

2011
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,240
lowering not constantly it doesn't

2012
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,079
happen like super quickly like not to

2013
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:44,318
don't want to make anyone look paranoid

2014
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:48,079
but you're lowering your level of

2015
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:49,119
cb1 receptors right like as you use

2016
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,880
cannabis

2017
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,640
if you use it every day you use it over

2018
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,039
time you're going to be lowering those

2019
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,558
cb1 receptors when you go on a tolerance

2020
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:59,119
break it allows your body

2021
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,000
to make more cb1 receptors and increase

2022
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,920
them again

2023
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,079
and you're kind of always shooting to

2024
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,720
find a sweet spot and

2025
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,119
if you just continuously use cannabis

2026
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,279
and

2027
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:12,000
you never take a tolerance break you're

2028
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,240
continuously developing tolerance and

2029
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,400
you're going to be continuously lowering

2030
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:18,719
your cb1 receptor density and for some

2031
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,880
people there's not a huge

2032
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:22,000
downside to that but for others there's

2033
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,680
big negative

2034
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,599
side effects and it all depends on the

2035
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:27,279
patient and what their goals are

2036
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:29,519
right because one of the biggest

2037
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,119
problems with tolerance is that

2038
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,960
when you develop a tolerance then the

2039
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:35,838
cannabis is no longer effective

2040
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,400
for what you need it to be effective for

2041
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:37,679
um

2042
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,760
and i was just talking to another

2043
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:41,919
scientist about this is that

2044
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,920
in our opinion the reason why we take

2045
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,880
tolerance breaks is because we need the

2046
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,559
plant to work

2047
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,039
when we need it and maybe that would be

2048
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,720
a way

2049
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,559
to to describe it to people who are

2050
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:54,159
maybe hesitant to try even taking a

2051
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,319
tolerance break is that

2052
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:57,440
you don't want the plant to lose

2053
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,558
efficacy

2054
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:03,039
you don't want it to stop working

2055
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,559
and it's possible that that happens when

2056
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,799
you develop tolerance

2057
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,319
and it's also possible that continuing

2058
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:09,759
to develop tolerance will lead to other

2059
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:11,838
negative side effects like having

2060
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,400
problems sleeping or having like other

2061
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:13,838
like

2062
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,000
there's some people who get um

2063
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:18,159
withdrawal symptoms of anxiety when they

2064
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,920
go to take a tolerance break so

2065
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:22,879
essentially the more tolerance you

2066
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,119
develop the more difficult it becomes to

2067
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,440
take a tolerance break and it's always

2068
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,838
easier just to regularly take

2069
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,119
you know build breaks into your routine

2070
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:33,440
um

2071
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:34,960
and again though this is this is going

2072
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,079
to be different from from person to

2073
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,400
person because

2074
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,599
i feel like i'm hypocritical even saying

2075
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,039
this because i do

2076
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,880
maintain a a level of tolerance like i

2077
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,400
pretty much take i take very short

2078
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,720
tolerance breaks

2079
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,318
but i don't take breaks that are longer

2080
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,558
than a week

2081
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:55,119
um and i don't i don't completely

2082
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,599
re-sensitize my system because

2083
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:58,559
my system as it is on a complete

2084
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,359
tolerance break

2085
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,319
is not a high quality of life for me so

2086
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:04,000
it

2087
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:05,759
i don't want to be i don't want to like

2088
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,960
mislead or you know

2089
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,000
spread spread negative um negative

2090
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,000
suggestions this is just

2091
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,280
like my experience is that i i do

2092
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,158
maintain a low

2093
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,798
a very very low tolerance um and i find

2094
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,798
that to be

2095
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:19,920
beneficial and i think it's it's all

2096
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,198
about finding that

2097
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,000
balance and maybe explaining it in that

2098
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,000
way where you

2099
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,520
need the balance of having the risk like

2100
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,600
the the relief

2101
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,719
like having the plant actually provide

2102
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,319
you with

2103
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:36,158
an effective relief balanced with

2104
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:38,560
having the right level of receptors in

2105
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,399
your brain right on i follow this

2106
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,480
and um and it makes a lot of sense too

2107
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:44,399
because there are a lot of patients who

2108
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:46,079
they do want to take some amount of

2109
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:48,158
tolerance breaks so that the

2110
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:50,479
the cannabis is more effective for them

2111
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,479
on a daily basis they want to get

2112
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,238
their receptors and and you know

2113
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,358
cannabinoids more in balance but at the

2114
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:57,278
same time

2115
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,120
going down to zero tolerance could be

2116
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:02,480
very extreme as well because

2117
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:04,318
i know that if i if if i have to stop um

2118
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:06,158
using cannabinoids for a while for some

2119
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,640
reason when i come back

2120
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,238
sometimes i get so high that like it's

2121
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,679
it's dysphoric right

2122
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:16,000
or people who have got um severe pain

2123
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,279
and they use cannabinoids at work to

2124
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,600
treat their pain

2125
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,040
well you know if they were to go a

2126
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,000
significant amount of time

2127
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:25,920
for a for a complete tolerance break

2128
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,719
well they may just be like super stoned

2129
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,798
at work

2130
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,480
you know like there there really is you

2131
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:32,479
know advanced patients with a lot of

2132
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,718
experience about cannabis

2133
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:36,798
really embrace the whole idea of

2134
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,520
individualized ken habitopathic care

2135
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,920
because

2136
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,920
we are all different but at the

2137
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,798
beginning we have to give patients

2138
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,480
general ideas and then you know it takes

2139
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:47,278
them almost no time you know once a

2140
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,599
patient has got

2141
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,279
cannabinoids they become you know

2142
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,039
scientists of their own body and it's

2143
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,280
and it's great to see

2144
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:57,119
i think that that's an amazing piece of

2145
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:58,639
you know on one side i know that it's

2146
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,679
something that people view as a very

2147
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,840
negative thing

2148
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,279
about cannabis and about plant medicine

2149
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,520
just in general is that

2150
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:07,039
everyone says are all it works for some

2151
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,960
people and it does nothing for other

2152
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,279
people and there's and it's

2153
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,039
i think that that's an amazing gift to

2154
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:16,158
be able to be empowered

2155
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:17,600
you know with with the option um and i

2156
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:19,599
do think that having like

2157
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,880
guidelines though is like for example if

2158
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,960
i was talking to someone

2159
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,880
new who was who is just getting into

2160
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,920
cannabis i absolutely would tell them to

2161
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,319
take tolerance breaks

2162
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,520
i i also think that tolerance breaks are

2163
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:31,679
really great

2164
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,800
you know clarity or relativity where

2165
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,039
then you can approach

2166
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,480
your use again every time you take a

2167
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:39,840
tolerance break

2168
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:41,439
it allows you to rehash exactly

2169
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,679
what therapeutic benefits you're getting

2170
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:46,079
from the plant how it's helping you

2171
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:46,960
and it gives you more perspective i

2172
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:49,279
think um

2173
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,480
on that so i absolutely would in the

2174
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,880
beginning like

2175
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,599
advise people to take tolerance breaks

2176
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,560
and then

2177
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,960
like you said um most of the time you

2178
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,320
know if this when when cannabis works

2179
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,439
for someone and like you said it's a

2180
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:04,238
last resort i mean

2181
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,960
i have to admit like cannabis was not

2182
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:07,678
the first

2183
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,158
thing that i tried um and it was in many

2184
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,440
ways

2185
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:15,039
a last resort like i was not

2186
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:16,719
i was not well um and when people

2187
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:18,319
are when you when you come to that and

2188
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,480
you find something that works for you

2189
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:21,759
it drives you to be so interested in it

2190
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:23,759
because especially

2191
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,800
in this prohibition era when we've been

2192
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,719
educated

2193
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,640
or at least i was educated that there

2194
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,198
you know there's nothing worse than

2195
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,400
being an addict and that it's going to

2196
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:35,919
ruin your life

2197
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:38,319
and that it's this horrible horrible

2198
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,719
thing um and then you know you

2199
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,399
experience this relief from it that you

2200
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,399
don't get from anything else

2201
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,319
i think that instills a passion of

2202
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:47,759
understanding of health on a deeper

2203
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:48,799
level and i think that's one of the

2204
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,360
greatest things

2205
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,279
about cannabis i think personal

2206
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:54,079
empowerment and personal responsibility

2207
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:57,198
in our in our

2208
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:58,479
lives is important and and a huge

2209
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:00,719
positive thing so

2210
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:01,839
i would encourage like other people you

2211
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:03,840
know listening and people

2212
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,520
that like spreading the knowledge and

2213
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,360
the education that

2214
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,199
there's a lot of power in personal

2215
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:11,039
experience and i know scientists are

2216
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:12,799
always talking about

2217
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,640
you know clinical research and having to

2218
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,279
have you know having

2219
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,679
trying to have the most experimental

2220
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,679
hard scientific data i agree with that i

2221
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,480
think that research is necessary

2222
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:26,640
but i also think that there is a huge

2223
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:28,238
huge amount of value in in the personal

2224
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,800
stories and in the personal narrative

2225
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:32,799
and we're all a part of that so right on

2226
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,719
the the oral history of medicine

2227
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,560
so i've got one one last quick question

2228
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:37,840
for you before we go to commercial

2229
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,760
these tolerance breaks that we're

2230
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,279
talking about um

2231
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,360
that don't get rid of all of your

2232
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,679
tolerance but bring you down to

2233
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:47,359
i don't know more usable levels while we

2234
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,560
know that they are different for every

2235
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,880
single person

2236
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,560
we have to recommend something to people

2237
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,119
for their like first time until so they

2238
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,760
can start

2239
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,039
start somewhere um when you take one of

2240
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,199
these tolerance breaks

2241
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,479
you said you you know rarely do it more

2242
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:02,639
than a week okay

2243
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:05,039
but what's your regular like my regular

2244
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,520
is 48 hours i go two full calendar days

2245
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:07,840
with a

2246
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,960
without anything and and on day three i

2247
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,000
seem to be

2248
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,600
you know reset what how does it work for

2249
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,760
you and what do you recommend

2250
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,880
wow that's that's so funny we are very

2251
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,480
very similar um

2252
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,560
so yeah it all depends on what your

2253
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:22,799
therapeutic minimum is so

2254
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,920
the therapeutic minimum is like the

2255
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,560
smallest dose

2256
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,440
that you can use to get the benefit that

2257
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,239
you're looking for

2258
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:30,719
right and and each of us has a different

2259
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:32,718
minimum

2260
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,840
some some people have a therapeutic

2261
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,679
minimum far

2262
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,279
far above mine mine's actually pretty

2263
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,119
low um

2264
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,198
so let's say that you have a therapeutic

2265
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:43,840
minimum that is like

2266
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:44,719
well above like 50 milligrams of like an

2267
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,480
edible

2268
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,840
an edible dose or something something

2269
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:50,639
relatively large

2270
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,400
right um it would probably mean that you

2271
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,320
would have to take tolerance breaks

2272
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:56,799
more often if you wanted them to be as

2273
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,279
short as what you and i

2274
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,159
are talking about for me my normal thing

2275
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:02,639
is i go

2276
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:04,879
usually somewhere between 36 to 48 hours

2277
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,760
at least every week and a half

2278
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,600
or so that seems to that seems to keep

2279
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:13,280
things i don't have a regular schedule

2280
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,960
i did for a while when i proposed my phd

2281
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:16,960
thesis i was

2282
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:19,359
i was like oh i'm proposing my phd

2283
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,198
thesis let me also propose this other

2284
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:23,920
thesis in my life and that's actually

2285
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:26,319
when i first introduced cbd

2286
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,760
into my regimen and i was keeping a

2287
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:28,000
notebook and i was writing everything

2288
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,560
down

2289
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,319
i was very rigid for about three years

2290
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,800
with it

2291
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,559
and developed a routine that now i can

2292
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,600
sort of just sense

2293
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,679
by feel but sometimes if i have

2294
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,960
if it lines up where i'm i'm free and i

2295
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:44,480
have like a

2296
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,239
a time on the weekend to take like a

2297
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:48,879
macro dose or a

2298
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,799
larger dose than i i normally would the

2299
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,000
beneficial effects can last for far

2300
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,480
longer for me

2301
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,679
and so that's sometimes i like kick off

2302
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:57,198
my tolerance break so

2303
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,119
to say with like a larger dose than i

2304
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:00,879
normally would and then i experience

2305
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:02,960
benefits that last for

2306
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,039
a few days after that um and it can

2307
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,600
begin like what would be a tolerance

2308
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:06,880
break

2309
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,640
um and then another thing that's

2310
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,159
important about tolerance breaks that i

2311
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,440
just want to hit on before we go to

2312
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:12,799
commercial is that

2313
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:14,399
it's an it's a good time when you're on

2314
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,480
a tolerance break also to think about

2315
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:17,279
your diet and water intake and other

2316
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:19,359
nutritional

2317
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,719
um it's just it's just a good time to

2318
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:22,158
think about it because you're already

2319
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:24,079
doing something different

2320
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:25,359
um so since you're already doing

2321
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:26,880
something different and taking a

2322
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:27,839
tolerance break you could think about

2323
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,560
really

2324
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,600
trying to you know make change like i

2325
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,440
you mentioned about

2326
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,280
like fish oil supplements or like even

2327
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:38,079
just in general un

2328
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:40,399
unsaturated fatty acids right like olive

2329
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:43,920
oil or coconut oil or fish or

2330
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:46,000
thinking about about your diet and um

2331
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,600
sleep hygiene and other times i use

2332
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,119
tolerance breaks those times to think

2333
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,920
about my overall health

2334
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:53,359
it's like a little mental retreat one

2335
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,239
more one more thing before we go to

2336
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:55,679
break

2337
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:57,599
these tolerance breaks this is all

2338
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,319
cannabinoids right you can't just stop

2339
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,120
thc

2340
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:02,319
but keep using cbd right you have to you

2341
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:03,760
stop all cannabinoids because you're

2342
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:04,399
trying to give the whole system a break

2343
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,480
right

2344
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:07,679
oh i never stopped taking cbd but that's

2345
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,678
just me that's just

2346
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:12,158
me personally um and i use like pretty

2347
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,880
low low doses of it i didn't i don't

2348
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:16,238
experience

2349
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:18,719
um i don't experience any like tolerance

2350
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,399
with cbd but i l i use at much lower

2351
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,319
concentrations i have

2352
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,238
i definitely have spoken to people like

2353
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,158
specifically people with seizures or

2354
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:27,359
migraines that use that benefit from

2355
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:30,639
like larger

2356
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:34,158
doses of cbd it will they will develop

2357
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:37,600
tolerance um to it so i do

2358
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:40,559
cycle them um in terms of like cbg

2359
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,120
cbd thc but thc is probably the only one

2360
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,600
that i take

2361
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:45,198
mandatory tolerance breaks from as far

2362
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,199
as how the receptors

2363
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:48,639
respond as far as like making more or

2364
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:49,919
making less which is essentially what

2365
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,960
we're trying to do with the tolerance

2366
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,399
break

2367
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:57,920
will if we're still taking

2368
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:59,519
cbd and we're not taking thc do the thc

2369
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,039
receptors

2370
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:06,159
go down in number as we want them to

2371
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:08,399
so in theory cbd has almost like an

2372
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:11,039
opposite effect on the cb1 receptor

2373
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:11,599
as thc so in theory it would not

2374
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,719
although i

2375
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,760
i can't say like with 100 knowledge that

2376
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,840
it's true because

2377
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,640
so here's here's the theory right like

2378
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,840
thc activates the cb1 receptor and it's

2379
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,199
that activation

2380
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,920
that causes the decrease um and cbd

2381
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:28,399
actually

2382
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,480
like it doesn't inactivate it it binds

2383
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:32,000
to the outside and it turns it down like

2384
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,359
it turns down the volume

2385
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,039
so it acts in a totally different

2386
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:37,839
mechanism it's not

2387
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:39,119
clear to me whether cbd has chant has

2388
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,199
caused changes in

2389
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:43,119
cb1 receptor density i i would need to

2390
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:44,960
look into that to see if

2391
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:47,599
if anything has been done before but i'm

2392
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,158
not in in theory it doesn't interact the

2393
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,360
same

2394
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:54,319
the same exact way um but

2395
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:55,599
i'm not i'm not yeah what you're saying

2396
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:57,039
makes sense though i mean there's a lot

2397
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,239
of the stuff that we talk about that we

2398
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,719
have to go on

2399
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:02,639
you know your educated intuition because

2400
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:06,000
this research hasn't been done but

2401
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:07,920
you're certainly got a perspective and a

2402
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,600
vista point a viewpoint of the

2403
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,119
the medicine which is you know a lot

2404
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,600
better than most of ours so

2405
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:15,198
so i'd rather go with your opinion than

2406
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,800
and then not know at all so

2407
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:18,559
yeah well i mean this is also it's my

2408
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,000
opinion and maybe the study has been

2409
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,880
done and i haven't read it yet i mean

2410
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,920
there's plenty you know

2411
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,679
there's there's um there's a lot more

2412
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,679
coming out and i am excited for us to

2413
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:29,760
you know i i am excited to see where

2414
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,359
where we go with research and like where

2415
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,199
the information takes us because i would

2416
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:36,479
like to know that is something that's

2417
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:38,799
an interesting like cb cbd the largest

2418
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:40,399
um to me at least benefits i in my

2419
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,679
opinion are happening through the

2420
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:45,039
the serotonin receptors for me but i use

2421
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:49,119
it for mental health

2422
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:51,279
um and cbd is really promiscuous it's a

2423
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:53,679
complicated molecule i mean it's

2424
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:56,319
promiscuous like it's not necessarily a

2425
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:56,800
bad thing but it binds to many things in

2426
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:00,238
the body

2427
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:02,000

half of their garden as males

educated

2499
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,480
it is increasingly important to avoid

2500
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,159
the use of chemical pesticides when

2501
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:25,839
cultivating cannabis

and today many cannabis cultivators are

2506
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,120
moving from sprays and chemicals to

while i love growing under the sun

2547
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:56,000
there's a lot of good reasons to grow

2548
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,679
indoors and if you're like most folks

2549
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,439
you want a lighting source that grows

2550
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:02,158
high yielding healthy plants without

2551
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:04,158
using excessive amounts of electricity

2552
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:05,279
bios lighting creates biological

2553
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:06,879
lighting solutions

2554
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:09,439
that brings the natural brilliance of

2555
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,520
the outdoors into your grow room

2556
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:13,198
bios lighting has the attributes that i

2557
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,159
look for in a horticultural lighting

2558
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:16,000
solution

2559
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:17,359
i've bought those cheap lights online

2560
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,479
and they're difficult to work with

2561
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:22,880
and fail in no time in contrast my

2562
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:24,000
bios led light is industrial grade to

2563
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,199
last a long time

2564
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,719
it is ip66 wet rated so little foliar

2565
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:30,559
overspray won't harm it

2566
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,560
it is easy to clean without taking it

2567
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,120
down and of course the most important

2568
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,440
aspect

2569
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:37,519
it is built for the exact light spectrum

2570
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:38,799
i want for great yielding healthy

2571
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,159
cannabis plants

2572
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,400
and it doesn't hurt that their lighting

2573
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:44,638
rigs look badass too

2574
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:46,238
many horticultural led lighting systems

2575
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,800
are based on irrelevant performance

2576
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:48,479
metrics

2577
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,960
and people love to argue online about

2578
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:52,959
these numbers i prefer to judge on par

2579
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:55,520
photon efficiency and how happy my

2580
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,840
plants are and the bios lights exceed my

2581
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,159
expectations in these categories

2582
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,480
bios lights have an optimized broad

2583
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:03,599
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis

2584
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:05,439
and plant growth

2585
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,440
while also providing the ideal

2586
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:09,279
conditions for superior par

2587
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:11,678
efficacy and a comfortable visual

2588
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:14,399
experience i also love their attentive

2589
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:16,719
and over-educated customer service folks

2590
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:18,638
bios starts with a team of biologists

2591
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,439
before getting the electrical engineers

2592
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,119
involved

2593
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:23,439
they have studied how light impacts

2594
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:25,119
cannabis plants and devised an overall

2595
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:26,399
strategy that works

2596
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:29,279

shango los and our guest this week is

2608
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:55,119
cannabis scientist and

2609
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:57,120
educator miyabi shields so miyabi

2610
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:59,840
we are to the part of the show that i

2611
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:01,760
have been the most uncomfortable about

2612
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,279
um and i didn't tell you much about this

2613
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,600
in advance so

2614
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:07,279
you know i know your company that you

2615
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,639
helped found which you know is not the

2616
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:10,158
point of the show today but it's called

2617
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,119
real isolates right

2618
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:14,158
and i know that you are a pharmaceutical

2619
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:16,800
chemist

2620
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:18,479
and you spend a lot of time looking at

2621
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,840
cannabinoid isolates

2622
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:21,519
and for people who aren't familiar we're

2623
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:25,360
talking about the pure

2624
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:27,360
molecule thc pure molecule cbd

2625
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:29,679
whereas normally i'm talking on this

2626
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:30,238
show about you know taking the whole

2627
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,800
plant

2628
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:33,519
resin from directly from the plant so

2629
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,000
instead of

2630
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,719
pulling out the isolates of the plant

2631
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,399
and then

2632
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,239
mixing and matching them like a

2633
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,719
pharmaceutical company would to kind of

2634
01:25:40,238 --> 01:25:45,839
you know build a medicine i'm more in

2635
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:49,359
the family of let's breed a plant

2636
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,159
that um uh affects that has the positive

2637
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:52,719
effect for the

2638
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:53,759
for the patient and then let's just do a

2639
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:56,880
whole resin

2640
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,199
extraction of that plant and then we've

2641
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,400
got

2642
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:02,559
a we've got a you know we've got we've

2643
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:04,079
got a medicine directly from nature

2644
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,840
and so that's what we talk about a lot

2645
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:08,559
on the show um

2646
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,360
but you know you are right there on the

2647
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,560
front lines

2648
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:15,519
of this science so

2649
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,080
so what what is your take on this like

2650
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,159
you know

2651
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:20,238
you you clearly understand what i'm

2652
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:21,119
talking about about whole plant medicine

2653
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:23,198
and the resin

2654
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:24,880
but i also know that from what i

2655
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,079
understand a lot of your research is

2656
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,960
into these individual

2657
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,960
molecules and for many of us like you

2658
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,039
know when cbd was really hard to find i

2659
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,158
mean nowadays the prices crashed but you

2660
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,319
know six years ago

2661
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:37,599
cbd was really hard to find and so we

2662
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:39,920
would we would often

2663
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,400
um recommend to patients that they take

2664
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,039
a whole plant extract from a thc

2665
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:46,079
plant and then add isolate to it to kind

2666
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:47,840
of artificially

2667
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:49,519
spike it so they could get the cbd that

2668
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:51,760
the studies were saying they were needed

2669
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,760
and oh my gosh i felt like i was making

2670
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,039
or participating in frankenstein

2671
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,840
medicine you know

2672
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:58,560
so so with with that whole kind of set

2673
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,560
up

2674
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,920
what are your thoughts in comparing

2675
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,039
whole plant medicine

2676
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:07,760
versus the more common use of cbd

2677
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:08,000
isolate thc isolate and now got help is

2678
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,840
d

2679
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,198
uh you know um delta eight isolate

2680
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,440
well actually it's funny that you

2681
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,279
mentioned that um our company name real

2682
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:19,678
isolates is sort of a play on words

2683
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:20,079
because there are there is no such thing

2684
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,440
as a

2685
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:25,600
real isolate um and we do research

2686
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:26,960
and doing research involves isolating

2687
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,440
these compounds and

2688
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,719
and looking at them but in terms of the

2689
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:33,039
the efficacy

2690
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:35,359
of whole plant extracts versus isolates

2691
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:38,479
i think that there are huge benefits to

2692
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:39,839
chemo diversity that are undervalued and

2693
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:41,519
under-researched and

2694
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,600
actually our whole company which i know

2695
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,880
is now probably a misnomer at the time

2696
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,000
we thought it was funny

2697
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,600
um real isolates um at the time we were

2698
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,960
like this makes perfect sense we'll tell

2699
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,000
everyone about how there's no real

2700
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,600
islets

2701
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,359
oh so it's like a science joke that no

2702
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,800
one gets

2703
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:59,359
well hopefully people will get it

2704
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:02,079
eventually um but actually our

2705
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:02,559
our entire our entire research is that

2706
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:04,399
we do

2707
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,080
and and everything is based upon you

2708
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:07,839
know this theory that

2709
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:09,920
i've been working on that has to do with

2710
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,239
chemo diversity and

2711
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,600
the potential essentially what you were

2712
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:15,519
just describing about whole plants

2713
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:19,280
making crude extracts with whole plants

2714
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:22,320
and the extremely extremely complex

2715
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:23,279
pharmacology that comes with crude

2716
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:25,840
extracts

2717
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:27,679
because if you think about have you have

2718
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,639
you heard of the the three body problem

2719
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,239
in physics

2720
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:32,880
no i'm not familiar with that okay so

2721
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:35,198
basically it's just a problem that says

2722
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,279
in in physics in a vacuum of space if

2723
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:40,319
you have two planets or two bodies

2724
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:41,759
it's it's very very easy to derive a

2725
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:43,679
mathematical equation

2726
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,119
that describes those two bodies it's

2727
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:48,158
very predictable

2728
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:48,960
and it's it's safe um so pharmaceutical

2729
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:51,119
chemistry

2730
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,560
is in many ways a two-body problem

2731
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,198
because you have the one

2732
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,960
synthetic molecule or in this case if

2733
01:28:55,198 --> 01:28:57,839
you were looking at isolates of cbd and

2734
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,600
thc

2735
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,199
you have the one molecule and then you

2736
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,560
have the the human body

2737
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:07,198
right um but in physics there's this

2738
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,280
problem where instead of two bodies you

2739
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:10,479
introduce a third body like a third

2740
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:12,800
planet and

2741
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:14,238
they're all rotating on each other and

2742
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,840
all of a sudden it becomes

2743
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:19,599
impossible to generate an equation

2744
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:22,319
to describe because it suddenly gets so

2745
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:25,120
complex and that's with three

2746
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:27,039
and the cannabis plant has over 400

2747
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:30,319
unique molecules

2748
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:31,198
in depending on the strain depending on

2749
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:32,799
the grow

2750
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:34,638
so depending on like the genetics and

2751
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,320
the chemovar depending on the grow

2752
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:38,400
conditions and how it's grown

2753
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:40,319
depending on the dry and cure process

2754
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:42,479
and how it's dried and cured

2755
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,079
then depending on how it's extracted

2756
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:45,919
whether or not it's distilled

2757
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:47,840
what are the distillation parameters

2758
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,039
like fraction distillation versus short

2759
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,560
bath distillation

2760
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:55,920
it is a hundred plus body problem

2761
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:58,000
like easily for sure but i'm at the

2762
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:00,319
point where like i embrace that problem

2763
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,960
because that hundred plus body problem

2764
01:30:00,319 --> 01:30:04,479
has very specific solutions that i don't

2765
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,520
believe that isolates can

2766
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:08,718
can solve um that's just a personal

2767
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:11,360
opinion

2768
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:12,960
of mine i personally believe that there

2769
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:15,439
are huge advantages

2770
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,279
to chemo diversity which is just a

2771
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:18,158
description of like the number of total

2772
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:21,198
molecules

2773
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:24,879
that are in an extract like for example

2774
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:27,519
um i have huge success making topicals

2775
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,800
with crude extracts of cannabis and

2776
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,920
willow bark

2777
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,360
and white willow bark has the precur has

2778
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,440
salicylic acid in it

2779
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:36,960
which is the scaffold that we use to

2780
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:39,678
make aspirin

2781
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,880
um but in addition to salicylic acid it

2782
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:44,800
has a bunch of other

2783
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:48,319
rare you know rare derivatives of

2784
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:50,239
salicylic acid similarly to how cannabis

2785
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:51,679
has all the rare cannabinoids and

2786
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:53,839
terpenes and flavonoids

2787
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,880
and other fatty acids and bioactive

2788
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,560
molecules right

2789
01:30:54,880 --> 01:31:00,319
and do we do we understand exactly how

2790
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,320
all of these things interact like

2791
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:04,399
no we don't understand that at all yet

2792
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:07,198
we're not there yet where we could say

2793
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:09,198
i will give you a synthetic mixture of

2794
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:11,599
all 400 of these things

2795
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:12,399
to cause a very specific effect i mean

2796
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,079
that would be

2797
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:16,399
the holy grail or that would be you know

2798
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:17,600
that would be the goal eventually of

2799
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:20,319
research um

2800
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,199
but we're nowhere close to there and in

2801
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:24,158
my opinion

2802
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:26,399
does the whole plant have unchartered

2803
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:29,039
territory and uncharted opportunities

2804
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:31,519
for various specific therapeutic effects

2805
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:34,719
and or increased effects

2806
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,440
um for like a a lower like risk

2807
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:38,319
potential

2808
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:40,238
like yes i think that isolates not

2809
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:41,679
necessarily cbd isolate but okay well

2810
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:43,439
cbd isolate maybe i'll

2811
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:45,039
i'll i could talk a little bit about

2812
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:48,399
that right so

2813
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:51,760
epidiolex is the pharmaceutical um

2814
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:54,479
cbd formulation and the dose for

2815
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,960
epidialex is extremely high i mean it's

2816
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:57,119
in the

2817
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,399
it's in like for my weight it would be

2818
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:01,519
like more than a gram

2819
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:02,799
more than once per day um extremely

2820
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,320
extremely high dose

2821
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,840
for it to be efficacious and obviously

2822
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:08,000
that's you know seizure disorders

2823
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:10,560
require higher doses

2824
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,039
but it's my personal opinion that you

2825
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,159
could

2826
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:17,039
potentiate cbd meaning you make cbd

2827
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:18,399
more effective by giving it with other

2828
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:21,039
cannabinoids that act

2829
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:22,079
synergistically so a synergistic

2830
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:24,399
interaction means

2831
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:26,719
more than additive um and these are

2832
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:28,399
things that are difficult to prove in a

2833
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,079
laboratory setting and i know that

2834
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:32,638
people are working on it and that it's

2835
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:33,679
it's being done um but in in the

2836
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:35,600
meantime in terms

2837
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:37,600
in terms of just like what my opinion is

2838
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,520
of it i think that the whole plant

2839
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:42,079
extracts have a lower

2840
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,159
risk potential for negative effects and

2841
01:32:42,079 --> 01:32:47,279
potentially in many ways

2842
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:49,198
a higher efficacy although there are

2843
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:51,519
advantages no there are no doubt

2844
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:53,279
advantages to distilling and purifying

2845
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:54,320
you can't you can't argue that there

2846
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:58,000
there are some

2847
01:32:54,319 --> 01:33:00,158
advantages to that um i guess just in

2848
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,439
in the personal context i am a big fan

2849
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:04,879
and use crude extracts and flour

2850
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:06,479
and i got to tell you i'm very relieved

2851
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:09,359
because i thought i was going into

2852
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:10,238
a a debate with a scientist who loved

2853
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:11,759
isolates

2854
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:13,439
and i'm like oh my god how am i going to

2855
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,520
hold my own defending

2856
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:17,198
whole plant and then here you are saying

2857
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:20,400
oh actually whole plant

2858
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:22,000
you know is you know is is is probably

2859
01:33:20,399 --> 01:33:24,079
preferred which is a huge relief

2860
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
to me well the whole whole plant is

2861
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:28,880
really just a combination of isolation

2862
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
right right i mean but it's but it's but

2863
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,840
it's not i mean i

2864
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,198
it's kind of like contrary right because

2865
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,360
i by name

2866
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:37,119
isolate means you're isolating one thing

2867
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:39,599
and um there

2868
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:40,238
there are absolutely advantages to to

2869
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,520
isolate

2870
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:46,799
although but in in my opinion

2871
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:48,480
um not for chronic use

2872
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,159
um it's like specifically we're talking

2873
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:51,839
about tolerance and taking tolerance

2874
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:52,960
breaks and i know i didn't i didn't

2875
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,679
mention it when we were talking about it

2876
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,198
but there's

2877
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:56,960
there's a very specific type of

2878
01:33:55,198 --> 01:34:00,158
withdrawal and acute withdrawal

2879
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:02,158
um that is coming up more and more uh

2880
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:06,319
called cannabis hyperemesis syndrome

2881
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:08,319
or chs and it's my personal opinion that

2882
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:11,119
that develops due to a very

2883
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:12,158
very specific type of tolerance and

2884
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:16,639
withdrawal to

2885
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:18,719
just thc um and it's i don't it's not

2886
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,400
it's nowhere near close to we're nowhere

2887
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:22,158
near close to understanding exactly how

2888
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:22,638
all of these things work or or whether

2889
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,119
or not

2890
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,400
this is this is like a hundred percent

2891
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:28,880
the mechanism but

2892
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:30,238
when you take a a whole plant extract

2893
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,400
that has

2894
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:34,000
you know a large number of different of

2895
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:35,519
different cannabinoids also

2896
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,039
you know the perfect example of this

2897
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,719
section which is you know touching on my

2898
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:40,000
current research project is smoking

2899
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:42,880
right like i

2900
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,880
i prefer cannabis smoke to the edible

2901
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,039
experience i know that that's true for a

2902
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,840
majority of people actually i recently

2903
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:50,639
pulled

2904
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,880
i pulled off my social media and got

2905
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:54,800
over 13 000 responses and it's

2906
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,319
pretty much an overwhelming majority of

2907
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,279
people prefer smoking and there's

2908
01:34:56,319 --> 01:34:59,599
there's

2909
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:01,359
no doubt advantages to edibles and

2910
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,639
that's in a comparable way to that

2911
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:04,880
there's no doubt advantages to

2912
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:07,279
pharmaceutical formulations but

2913
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,560
many edibles these days are made with

2914
01:35:07,279 --> 01:35:11,439
distillate

2915
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,960
um they're made with very very

2916
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:14,158
concentrate and distillate even though

2917
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,560
it's not isolate

2918
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:18,000
is practically isolated i mean it

2919
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,639
depends it depends on

2920
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,158
you know the the dispensary the producer

2921
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:24,239
and the lab that's making it

2922
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:26,158
but they're it's often i think it's

2923
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:27,599
common practice for people to distill

2924
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:30,000
above 85

2925
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,280
right um which basically means that

2926
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,560
you're taking out everything else and

2927
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:33,840
you're hyper selecting for the

2928
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,480
cannabinoids

2929
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:38,400
and you know i'm kind of going to circle

2930
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:39,198
here but i prefer smoking and i always

2931
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:41,279
had

2932
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:42,799
and and majority people prefer smoking

2933
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:44,079
and one of the reasons why i believe

2934
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,639
that is because

2935
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:47,840
smoking produces the most diverse

2936
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:50,239
formulation

2937
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,360
out of anything that you possibly could

2938
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:53,039
intake

2939
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:55,439
in terms of like a crude edible

2940
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:57,600
extraction like butter or rso

2941
01:35:55,439 --> 01:35:58,559
versus a distillate extraction versus

2942
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,119
smoking

2943
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,039
the distillate edibles are on one side

2944
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:03,920
and so like isolates and distillate are

2945
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:07,439
on one side

2946
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:10,800
of like the purest form of just thc

2947
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:12,479
or just cbd um and then crude extracts

2948
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,279
or whole plant extracts are in the

2949
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:16,559
middle

2950
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:18,559
and then smoking is on the opposite side

2951
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:21,280
in terms of just the the total number of

2952
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,679
like the complexity of the formulation

2953
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,840
of cannabinoids that you're taking in

2954
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:28,960
and that you know this has been

2955
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,719
my big passion and something that i'm

2956
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:33,359
passionate about researching for

2957
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:34,960
like for a while now is why is that and

2958
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:37,679
looking into it and

2959
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,158
you know it would take a super computer

2960
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,960
and

2961
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:41,359
a lot of simulation to even be able to

2962
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,079
to

2963
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:46,479
begin to predict the like the complex

2964
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:48,719
interactions like at the receptor level

2965
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:49,599
um that occur with with so many

2966
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:52,319
different mixtures

2967
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,960
right like especially especially when

2968
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:55,439
you have

2969
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,118
the fact that you have like flavonoids

2970
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:58,158
and terpenes and other bioactive

2971
01:36:57,118 --> 01:37:00,399
molecules like

2972
01:36:58,158 --> 01:37:01,198
there's a lot of factors to take into

2973
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:02,719
consideration

2974
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:05,039
and you blew me away the other day when

2975
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:08,399
you when you taught that um

2976
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:11,118
that even regardless of what your

2977
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:11,679
your analytics say about your flower

2978
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:14,238
when you

2979
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:14,800
burn the flower you are actually

2980
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:17,599
bringing

2981
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:18,400
additional cannabinoids into existence

2982
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,880
so that a

2983
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:21,679
burnt a combusted flower like in a joint

2984
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,239
or something

2985
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:24,719
is even more pharmacologically complex

2986
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:26,479
than

2987
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,079
what you think is in it when you look at

2988
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:30,079
your lab tests

2989
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:31,760
absolutely i mean there's we always talk

2990
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:34,079
about the negatives and the downsides

2991
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,880
to smoking and i there's it you can't

2992
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:37,279
argue that there

2993
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,000
are some negatives to smoking as a

2994
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:40,399
method

2995
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,600
but there are some benefits as well and

2996
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:44,799
there are some

2997
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:46,159
very very unique um you know things that

2998
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,000
that occur and

2999
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:49,359
yeah in terms of like what i was

3000
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,960
mentioning about like depending

3001
01:37:49,359 --> 01:37:52,799
regardless of what the flower looks like

3002
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:56,000
i mean a lot of

3003
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:58,320
thc will get converted because it is a

3004
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,319
it's a reactive molecule and you heat it

3005
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:02,479
to a very very high temperature

3006
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:04,000
and then the flower has other reactive

3007
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:06,879
molecules as well

3008
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,279
the terpenes are all extremely volatile

3009
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,719
um

3010
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:10,960
and then there's just the fact like when

3011
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:13,198
we talk about combustion you know true

3012
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:15,359
combustion means you're going all the

3013
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:19,039
way down to co2 and

3014
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:20,960
water and we do not fully combust

3015
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:22,880
the the flour i mean when you're at the

3016
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:23,760
very very end of your bowl and it's all

3017
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,840
white and ashy

3018
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,600
like yeah okay that's you know that's

3019
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:29,119
completely combusted

3020
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,960
but when we're typically smoking you

3021
01:38:29,118 --> 01:38:32,079
know like when you're not running

3022
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,439
totally dry

3023
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:37,279
like you're not fully combusting um

3024
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:38,559
you're heating and extracting at the

3025
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:41,118
same time

3026
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,159
and you're also transforming and yeah

3027
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:44,479
it's

3028
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:46,559
i think chemo diversity has a huge

3029
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:48,319
impact on the overall effect i mean i

3030
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,000
i can tell you right now that like no

3031
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:51,599
one will be able to convince me

3032
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,679
that smoking doesn't give me a different

3033
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,400
formulation because it feels

3034
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,520
so different it sure does like and

3035
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:00,079
there's so many

3036
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,199
specific effects um in terms of strain

3037
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:03,198
specificity that i'm

3038
01:39:01,198 --> 01:39:04,799
and perhaps i just don't have experience

3039
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:06,479
with enough experience with strain

3040
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,840
specific edibles because

3041
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:09,839
you know so many edibles are made with

3042
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,239
distillate um

3043
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:13,440
which distills them back down so it

3044
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:15,039
simplifies them and

3045
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:16,559
i just know that the high is not nearly

3046
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:18,158
as good smoking

3047
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,679
you know distillate or actually any

3048
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:21,279
version of distillate

3049
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,639
let's let's let's finish with this

3050
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:22,880
question because i i don't want to keep

3051
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:26,400
you

3052
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:28,800
uh longer than we agreed to the

3053
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:30,559
um when we talk about whole plant

3054
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,600
medicine with many scientists at

3055
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,159
conventions

3056
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,719
people tell me ah whole plant medicine

3057
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:37,359
is

3058
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:38,880
messy we can't control it we don't know

3059
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:41,920
what's in it whereas

3060
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:45,520
you're talking about the benefits of

3061
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:47,920
chemical uh diversity and and you know i

3062
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,199
come from a place of efficacy that just

3063
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,639
works so much better

3064
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:52,079
when you're talking scientists to

3065
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,840
scientists what do you tell that other

3066
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:55,840
scientist who says that

3067
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,440
you know cannabis resin is messy and

3068
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,800
uncontrolled and so we should go in a

3069
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:02,559
different direction

3070
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,560
i tell them that real life is messy

3071
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:07,519
real life is pretty uncontrolled and

3072
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:08,238
that i absolutely love the scientific

3073
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,480
regor

3074
01:40:08,238 --> 01:40:12,238
of getting in the lab and minimizing

3075
01:40:10,479 --> 01:40:15,678
variables but that's just not

3076
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:18,479
life and i i know that

3077
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:18,960
this is something that many scientists

3078
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:21,439
do

3079
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,239
and will in future disagree with me over

3080
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:25,118
and

3081
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:26,158
i was very hesitant about talking about

3082
01:40:25,118 --> 01:40:29,039
it for

3083
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:29,679
for a long time for that reason um

3084
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:32,479
because i

3085
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:33,279
i do agree that there is it is messy i

3086
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:37,039
mean i

3087
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:40,880
i agree that it's unknown right um

3088
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:43,840
and it's it's complicated

3089
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,960
but then i also can't help but think

3090
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:49,760
about

3091
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:52,319
reality and um you know reality is

3092
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:52,880
messy and uncontrollable and complicated

3093
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:54,639
and

3094
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,880
to your point you know just to close

3095
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:59,679
like the most important thing

3096
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,359
to me is helping other people improve

3097
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:03,679
their quality of life

3098
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:04,639
and efficacy is where it's at and let me

3099
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:06,399
just like

3100
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:09,359
this is just like a thought like a

3101
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:12,000
little like thing a seed of thought but

3102
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:12,479
you know most drugs that go to clinical

3103
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,880
trial

3104
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:16,638
from like pharmaceutical synthetic drugs

3105
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,359
going to clinical trial

3106
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:21,118
um first of all it's extremely expensive

3107
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:23,279
to get them to a clinical trial but

3108
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:25,198
by the time they get there the most

3109
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:26,960
common reason why they fail

3110
01:41:25,198 --> 01:41:28,319
is not because they're toxic but it's

3111
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,679
because they are not

3112
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:32,000
efficacious the most common reason why a

3113
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:33,920
drug

3114
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,118
will fail a clinical trial is because it

3115
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,158
just simply doesn't

3116
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:41,279
work so i guess

3117
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:43,118
my question to another scientist who

3118
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:45,118
would say that it's messy my question

3119
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:48,158
would be like

3120
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:50,639
so it's messy but it works and like

3121
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:51,198
the reduction of suffering is the goal

3122
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:53,279
is in

3123
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:55,599
is it the goal right exactly is that the

3124
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:57,359
goal and if that is the goal which i

3125
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,039
i think everyone agrees that that's the

3126
01:41:57,359 --> 01:42:01,198
goal um

3127
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,800
then why shouldn't we value something

3128
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,599
that's messy and try to work with it

3129
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,679
because i

3130
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,639
i totally agree and understand it is

3131
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:08,158
messy there

3132
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:09,760
there's tons of questions i mean even

3133
01:42:08,158 --> 01:42:11,599
with you know my project is looking at

3134
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:14,800
cannabis smoke i opened

3135
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:16,159
pandora's box and

3136
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,600
there's a lot of questions and a lot of

3137
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:19,439
things to be figured out and a lot of

3138
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,880
unknown and i think the unknown makes

3139
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:22,960
people scared but

3140
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,400
you know there's a thing about science

3141
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,800
like where

3142
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:28,000
scientists are like searching around in

3143
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:31,440
the dark underneath

3144
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:34,960
one street lamp so like the universe is

3145
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:35,919
this dark mysterious thing and science

3146
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,840
just has this

3147
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:40,239
like the little street lamps of

3148
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:42,159
technology like if you imagine every new

3149
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,759
technological advance is a new little

3150
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:44,079
street lamp that you can kind of like

3151
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,400
turn

3152
01:42:44,079 --> 01:42:48,000
on and look under and all of us are down

3153
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:49,920
on our hands and knees as scientists

3154
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,399
with a magnifying glass

3155
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:53,600
looking under the street lamp and then

3156
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:55,198
everyone else is like well what if the

3157
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:58,239
answer is in the dark

3158
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:59,359
you know what i mean and we we don't

3159
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:02,718
have the answer to that

3160
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:04,079
so you know that would be i guess this

3161
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:05,039
is like and i would love to have a

3162
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:06,158
discussions with

3163
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:07,920
and i'm sure i will have many

3164
01:43:06,158 --> 01:43:08,238
discussions with other scientists on

3165
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,639
this

3166
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:13,678
but um you know i've been speaking with

3167
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:16,319
