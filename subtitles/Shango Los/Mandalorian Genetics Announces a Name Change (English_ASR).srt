00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,679
hey there friends it's chango from

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,679
shaping fire and i'm here with my good

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,919
friend dan jimmy from mandalorian

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,160
genetics and a lot of you have noticed

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,759
that dan has been uh kind of teasing

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,919
that he has a big announcement coming

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,600
and today is the day so we're here on my

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,359
patio for uh him to let us all know so

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,039
dan what's the story what's the big news

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
i guess we'll get into it shango um

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,439
we're gonna go through a name change um

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,278
and actually as of today it'll be the

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,039
name going forward

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,359
we're going to be switching to gnome

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
automatics and i think it's a good

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,880
direction and i think it's going to be

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,199
really beneficial for the company so

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,120
mandalorian genetics is a cool name and

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
we've all grown to love it and you know

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,238
a lot of people you know call you dan

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,960
mandalorian um it must have been a hard

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,198
choice to decide to leave mandalorian as

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,920
an as a brand and switch to anything at

24
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,119
all

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,120
absolutely it's honestly one of the

26
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,198
hardest decisions i think i've made over

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,640
the last couple years with the brand and

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,039
i think it's also one of the smartest

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,920
moves that we could have done we want to

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,519
embrace the change grow as a company and

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,680
having mandalorian

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,880
as a name moving forward as we grow

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,640
could be potentially dangerous for the

34
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,039
company yeah i can see how there'd be a

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,200
threat because um

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
you know uh the disney folks have got

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,118
lawyers they do have lawyers they and

38
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,039
like you know they probably have lawyers

39
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,319
for those lawyers so i think

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,920
to

41
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,839
sidestep and move forward it's the best

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,680
thing we can do yeah was often a good

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,680
move for small business owners like us

44
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,960
just kind of avoid that whole shtick

45
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,200
yeah so even though you liked the

46
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,559
mandalorian genetics name you're moving

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,118
on to gnome automatics um what is it

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,000
about the the name gnome automatics that

49
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,759
you identify with mostly the gnome side

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
uh the gnome side my cousin and i have

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,560
joke for years that i'm the gnome is on

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
the shorter one of the two and most of

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,640
you guys know that my cousin and i you

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,399
know run the mandalorian page in the

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,920
mandalorian genetics side of things and

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,519
he's always kind of called me a gnome

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,719
and he's also 6'4 so it's kind of

58
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,640
fitting

59
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,039
so i kind of identify that for

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,000
with that for a long time so i think the

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,600
gnome side is you know embodying me

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,118
into the brand a little bit more making

63
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,318
it more original and then the automatic

64
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,439
side is you know it's a it's a twist on

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,359
the word autos because that's where our

66
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,598
primary focus is we do work with

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,040
photoperiod plants but the automatics is

68
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,719
something i've embraced for a long time

69
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,479
so i think the marriage of the two is

70
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,840
really good for the brand

71
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,878
not only that like you know it's

72
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
definitely where you built your

73
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,679
reputation exactly that's where i came

74
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
from it's where i've you know showed

75
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
passion for a lot of years

76
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,359
so um you know some people might be

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,120
curious because you know there you know

78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,720
if you look across the entire country

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,280
there are a couple different cannabis

80
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,120
companies that use the word gnome um do

81
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,959
you have any concerns about like brand

82
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,480
confusion or anything like that um not a

83
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
whole lot i mean i'm sure there may be a

84
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,840
little bit at first which is fine but i

85
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,000
think with you know that tie in with the

86
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,519
gnome automatics and the the way that we

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,439
advertise i think people get a clear

88
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,439
picture and this video helped too you

89
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,959
know makes it more intimate to all of

90
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,560
our followers and all of our customers

91
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,120
that they get a clear picture of what

92
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,479
we're doing and why we're doing it yeah

93
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,239
well you've always been really big with

94
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,679
the outreach with your customers right

95
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,719
right like a lot of a lot of folks in

96
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,200
the canvas industry um you know they

97
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,199
they make pronouncements to their

98
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,719
fan base and they don't really include

99
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,000
them but

100
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,439
when you reached out to me you're all

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,560
like you know i don't want to make this

102
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,439
name change

103
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,519
without everybody who follows the brand

104
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,359
knowing why and so they can come along

105
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
for the ride and i think that speaks a

106
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,440
lot to how you interact with everybody

107
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,959
by like kind of embracing folks you know

108
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,479
right and that's where my heart is too

109
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,239
is like i like to embrace i'd like to be

110
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,639
one-on-one and i feel like a better term

111
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,799
intimate with you know my customers and

112
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,518
the consumers of the seeds and you know

113
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,840
it's

114
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,759
just one more step

115
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,120
in the right direction yeah

116
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,679
so um so do we all need to change where

117
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,239
we follow you on social media like like

118
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,080
do we have to move over to a new

119
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,920
instagram page or are you going to be

120
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
able to keep the same mandalorian pages

121
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,719
and just change the name we're going to

122
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,479
be able to keep the same mandalorian

123
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,919
page you know and change the name

124
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,598
because fortunately with the gnome

125
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,598
automatics pairing we have a lot of

126
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,119
options to go down that road and what

127
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,719
that will do is it'll allow us to keep

128
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,280
the confusion low and then of course

129
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,479
with the full dupe plex page myself

130
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,840
you'll be able to see all the work and

131
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,959
everything coming out from there too

132
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,319
right on

133
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,720
so um so the gnome automatics page is up

134
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,680
today right correct right on and so if

135
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,160
you want to get on the new mailing list

136
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,280
that is going to be dedicated

137
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,680
to gnome automatics drops um they should

138
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,879
go to gnomeautomatics.com right correct

139
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,240
