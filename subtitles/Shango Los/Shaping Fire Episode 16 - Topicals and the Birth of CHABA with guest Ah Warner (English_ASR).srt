for entrepreneurs than most all

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,279

9
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,719
accepts cannabis clients a location that

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,339
will rent to them and find suppliers who

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,339
may themselves be unsure about working

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,710
with cannabis companies and sometimes an

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,019
entrepreneur needs to create a law that

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,929
will even allow their business to exist

plant cannabis with THC the astonishing

51
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,919
thing though is that they have THC and

52
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:58,709

visionary cannabis companies in the

66
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,530
country while inspiring people in other

67
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:31,079
states to figure out how they can create

68
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,030
chavos where they live like Oh has done

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,650
in Washington and that's what we're

70
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,620
going to talk about today welcome to the

71
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,629
show ah hey thank you so much I'm so

72
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,819
happy to be here I'm very glad you are

73
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,250
so let's get right into it so you know

74
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,799
during the 2016 washington state

75
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,930
legislative session you successfully

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,050
lobbied for a new state law that would

77
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,120
allow full plant cannabis extract health

78
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,330
and beauty products with a THC content

79
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,390
of less than point three percent to be

80
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,770
sold in regular unlicensed stores and

81
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,349
you know this was a big deal because

82
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,270
this kind of law exists nowhere else in

83
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,769
the United States so tell us a little

84
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,560
bit about this law and what it took to

85
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,409
get past it was actually so that's all

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,709
true except that it was 2015 oh gosh so

87
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,780
yeah so we introduced the language Jean

88
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,360
eco well senator Jay Nicole wells was my

89
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,530
champion in the Senate and we introduced

90
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,830
that language in January 22nd of 2015

91
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,959
and it was passed signed by Endsley on

92
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,469
june thirtieth and enacted on july first

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,390
of 2015 so it's been over a year and a

94
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:39,629
half now it feels like it's amazing it's

95
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,939
amazing how time flies but you are

96
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,829
absolutely correct this is some

97
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,859
legislation this is law that doesn't

98
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,260
exist in any other state in the Union um

99
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,120
and so we're leading the way for

100
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,979
cannabis health and beauty aids so

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,620
products less than point three percent

102
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:58,109
PA SI non intoxicating and topical

103
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,909
applications only are available to be

104
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,160
sold on the mainstream market place here

105
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:04,769
in washington state only yeah it's

106
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,329
profound and so i want to drill into

107
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,709
this just a little bit more because I a

108
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,540
lot of people are like well we've got

109
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,489
cannabis laws in our state why aren't

110
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:17,159
they the same what is what makes this

111
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:20,310
particular law unique well it basically

112
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,439
it defines so that I see three divisions

113
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,569
of cannabis topicals one is hemp body

114
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,800
care one is cannabis health and beauty

115
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,389
aids in the middle and that's what we're

116
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,610
specifically talking about and then the

117
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,530
third one would be recreational /

118
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,419
medical topicals that are sold in a

119
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:37,278
regular in a highly regulated market

120
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:39,899
like our 50 to market and so we are

121
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:41,759
csaba is the only place that Java

122
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,938
actually exists is here in Washington

123
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,218
State and so what we did was we defined

124
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,528
it for the first time we defined it as

125
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:51,269
not marijuana and we were able to get it

126
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:54,478
removed out of the washington state

127
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:57,028
controlled substances act which was a

128
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,128
big deal and it means a lot for other

129
00:04:57,028 --> 00:05:01,408
states because it was with we were the

130
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:03,270
first day to remove anything cannabis

131
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:06,449
out of any state's Controlled Substances

132
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,579
Act and I believe it to be true that now

133
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,960
industrial hemp hasn't even been removed

134
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,839
out of any state's Controlled Substances

135
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,589
Act so this is the first chipping way of

136
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,448
the block of a state csa so pretty proud

137
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:20,579
of it yeah that's a lot to be a proud of

138
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,430
and you know since so much of us are

139
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:26,550
throwing around this this sub point

140
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,069
three percent as it as it applies to the

141
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,329
cvd from hemp world I think it's

142
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,639
important that we take a moment and

143
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:34,378
clarify for folks that that this is not

144
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,598
what we're talking about it's that same

145
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,939
point three percent number but we're

146
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:41,668
talking about authentic cannabis plants

147
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:44,639
not industrial hemp and the key point is

148
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:46,348
the percentage of THC in the final

149
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,360
product that goes on the shelf which

150
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:50,938
must stay below 0 point three percent

151
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,158
right absolutely yeah and so I used that

152
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:54,330
hemp level because I knew that that was

153
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:56,699
the one that was everyone was

154
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:59,519
comfortable with in the United States at

155
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,408
less than point three percent THC I used

156
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,318
that when we were writing the language

157
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:06,300
but but just because it's less than

158
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,819
point three percent THC as a finished

159
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,028
product it doesn't make it hemp it's

160
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,949
chava hemp is a plant a cannabis plant

161
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:15,899
that's less than point three percent THC

162
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,509
so there are very different definitions

163
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,639
but we absolutely use the same number

164
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:22,348
and I just want to make sure that people

165
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,300
understand you know when you say less

166
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,709
than point three percent THC in a

167
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,639
finished product so I'm talking about a

168
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:32,128
cream or ointment or lotion you're

169
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,430
actually talking about 85 less than

170
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:38,069
eighty five milligrams of THC in a

171
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,019
finished one ounce product so people

172
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,129
think I'll less than point 3 % HC it's

173
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,709
nothing will actually a

174
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:45,869
is quite a bit 8080 less than eighty

175
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:48,149
five milligrams is quite a bit in a one

176
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:50,159
ounce container yeah absolutely and so

177
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,800
you're right when saying point three

178
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:55,110
percent it sounds like in an

179
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,399
insignificant number but when you when

180
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,019
you switch over to milligrams they're

181
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,369
like uh you know in and out that makes a

182
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:01,559
lot of sense as far as yeah you know

183
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:03,089
relief goes when you look at active

184
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,860
ingredients in like an arnica cream

185
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:06,959
you're talking the active ingredients

186
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,489
like five milligrams seven you know what

187
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,709
I mean they're really low when you talk

188
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:14,278
an active ingredients in in healthy Oh

189
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:16,348
in you know topical therapeutics did you

190
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:18,990
find that you you really had a lot of

191
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:21,149
challenge with legislators who just

192
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,338
didn't want to touch the cannabis topic

193
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,619
at all you know was it was it difficult

194
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:27,959
for you to kind of have them understand

195
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:31,469
to tease out the difference between you

196
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,269
know other cannabis policy and cannabis

197
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:35,519
policy as it applies to health and

198
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:38,668
beauty aids well I have to say you know

199
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,978
I was very very you know this is 2015 so

200
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:44,098
medical was being shut down I mean we've

201
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:46,618
had this tumultuous transition it's been

202
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:48,209
very painful but I have I really was

203
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:51,329
conscious of the fact that I needed to

204
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:53,369
keep shabbos separate from medical

205
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:56,038
marijuana and chavez separate from

206
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:58,259
recreational or adult adult use

207
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:01,408
marijuana and so I was conscious of that

208
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,619
fact and the legislators in Olympia

209
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:06,240
they're pretty savvy they do I didn't

210
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:08,579
have a whole lot of opposition and

211
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,399
actually you know there was only one

212
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:13,949
when my son and I lobbied Olympian took

213
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,499
our two of our products to every office

214
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:19,800
in Olympia there was only one office

215
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:21,509
that refused to take it and so everybody

216
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,338
was pretty happy and you can you can be

217
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,288
guaranteed that Olympia was talking

218
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:27,538
about cannabis topicals in cannabis

219
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:30,028
basics for like you know three weeks

220
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:31,709
after that okay so no they were very

221
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:33,538
receptive is the short answer to that

222
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:37,019
right on and you know while we're on

223
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:39,568
that you know I i have heard you talk to

224
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:43,110
a lot of different folks about you know

225
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:44,698
how to approach policy makers and so so

226
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,980
as of this as an aside why don't you

227
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:49,409
just take a moment and give folks your

228
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,509
general primer because as so many people

229
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:54,058
get are so emotional about wanting to

230
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:54,659
liberate cannabis for for patients and

231
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:56,519
for

232
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,379
that sometimes they they go and they

233
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,060
interact with their politicians as if

234
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,920
they're the enemy and I think that

235
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,289
everybody can learn something from you

236
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,870
about how you approach them well it's

237
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:08,730
about perspective and so in the cannabis

238
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,929
culture in the kanima community cannabis

239
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,339
community we have a different

240
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:14,099
perspective but you have to understand

241
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:17,129
it in order to make anything happen to

242
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,319
change you know to liberate cannabis we

243
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:21,600
have to work from their perspective so

244
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:24,479
when you go first of all reach out to

245
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,689
your legislators legislators but always

246
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,250
be professional always you know please

247
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:30,240
and thank you and always look

248
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,799
professional when you're down there

249
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,870
because remember they're not walking

250
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,909
into your community you're walking into

251
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,889
theirs so it's really important that you

252
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,559
be yourself because that's what speaks

253
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:43,259
to them but you but you must present

254
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,149
yourself like you you are down there

255
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,009
lobbying every time you walk into a

256
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:49,769
legislators office you're actually

257
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:52,680
lobbying for a cause so present yourself

258
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,240
be serious and you know and if they're

259
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,758
trying to make jokes you know because it

260
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,709
is weed you know just keep you know be

261
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,180
light-hearted about it but remember say

262
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,518
this is really isn't a laughing matter

263
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:04,318
anymore we really need to work on this

264
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,929
and get through you know the fear and

265
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:09,659
the you know the laughable part of this

266
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:13,708
but for me specifically what it was was

267
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:15,299
I just happen to have the champion

268
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,799
washington state champion jeannie

269
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,740
Caldwell's who's now in king county

270
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,568
council woman call wells she happened to

271
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,120
be the senator for my legislative

272
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:26,429
district 236 district in in washington

273
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,068
state and so she was the perfect person

274
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:31,948
I I got an introduction to her I had a

275
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:33,688
meeting with her and from get she was

276
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:35,338
just like oh these are amazing this

277
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:37,139
doesn't make any sense why they would be

278
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,389
regulated so heavily blah blah blah you

279
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,909
know what I mean she she was all in from

280
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:44,009
the beginning within six months we had

281
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:46,230
legislation we introduced it and six

282
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:47,909
months later it was passed so what you

283
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,909
think is going to be a super super

284
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:53,338
daunting thing can sometimes be fairly

285
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:55,350
easy it's all about putting one foot

286
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,500
front of the other and being clear about

287
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,170
what you're asking for so after you got

288
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,750
this new never been seen before chavo

289
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:06,179
law passed I'm assuming that you had to

290
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,470
go on a serious education campaign with

291
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,969
retailers

292
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,500
like you had to do with legislators

293
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,090
because they must have been a little

294
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,460
astonished that they could actually even

295
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,889
carry your product yeah and just like I

296
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,710
had to do to retailers back in the 90s

297
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:24,960
for him and just like I had to do in the

298
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:26,879
mid to that 2012-2013 for the medical

299
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,700
world for topicals I mean it's been one

300
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:33,299
education after another but retailers

301
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,620
now you know the irony and I definitely

302
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,629
want to make this point is that

303
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,879
marijuana being legalized has brought

304
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,610
attention to my whole company my hemp

305
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,980
line and my chava line and retailers are

306
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:47,430
much more savvy now than they were even

307
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,529
two years ago you know it's hip cannabis

308
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:51,059
is now acceptable so when they didn't

309
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:53,309
wouldn't even talk to you before at

310
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,079
least they're having a conversation now

311
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,869
that being said I have had some bigger

312
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,700
buyers in Washington State say we're

313
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,289
just not ready for this we're just not

314
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,400
willing to take the risk even though I

315
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:07,409
can refer them to the RCW that shows

316
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,360
them that it's absolutely legal for them

317
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:11,429
to tell to sell these products in their

318
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,519
store some of them are still

319
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:18,059
apprehensive that being said we are

320
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,309
making progress you know I lost 125

321
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:24,509
medical marijuana stores on July

322
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:26,939
fifteenth of this year I'm sorry of 2016

323
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:30,090
so I lost my entire medical marketplace

324
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:32,940
and now i'm up to about 55 mainstream

325
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:36,379
stores so we're talking grocery stores

326
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,370
and spas and coffee shops and

327
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:40,529
chiropractic doctors naturopathic

328
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,600
doctors this is the type of buyer that i

329
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,389
have now and they're far more savvy than

330
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,399
I you know I would even say some of the

331
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,549
medical buyers that I was dealing with

332
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,500
two years ago and now i actually have

333
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:55,319
because i'm in the mainstream i have the

334
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,149
opportunity to have distribution and so

335
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,760
now I now have the first distribution

336
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:01,439
deal for champa product I believe in

337
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,720
Washington State and so now I have

338
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,350
someone else reaching out to the bigger

339
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,820
buyers on my behalf and so it's kind of

340
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,070
streamline this and make this happen

341
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,560
much more quickly but buyers are much

342
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,750
more savvy these days I can imagine the

343
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,289
on your behalf part can be challenging

344
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,889
because as you are selling to the retail

345
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:24,219
level buyers they

346
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:27,730
inter need to explain what's going on to

347
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,739
the end user and our consumers buying

348
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,839
the products do they get it the

349
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:33,489
consumers get it and I have to tell you

350
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,619
in most cases you know every time I

351
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:37,959
speak and I do a fair amount of speaking

352
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:41,139
the last thing that I say is the best

353
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:43,268
thing that you could do for for java and

354
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:46,659
for liberating all of cannabis is to

355
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:48,159
talk to your local retailer your corner

356
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,738
store where you go in to get your milk

357
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,448
ask them do they carry any java and of

358
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:55,839
course this is only Washington stay for

359
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:57,219
now but ask them do you have any Java do

360
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,439
you have any cannabis health and beauty

361
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,910
aids and if they don't say well I would

362
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,849
encourage you to look into it it's now

363
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:06,188
legal for you to sell it and so it's

364
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,709
it's consumers and it's patients also

365
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:10,448
going to their doctors and asking their

366
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:13,298
chiropractors it's safe for me to use

367
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:16,588
this it's really working for me so it is

368
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:19,028
kind of a groundswell of consumers

369
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:21,129
asking the retailers and asking their

370
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:23,048
care providers to carry these products I

371
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:24,579
mean I was like I'm excited to talk to

372
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:26,078

this is shaping fire and i am your host

411
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:51,549
Shango Lohse today's guest is aa Warner

412
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,490
founder of cannabis basics so in the

413
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:56,589
first set we were talking about how I

414
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,470
got the first in the nation chava law

415
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:01,750
passed and now we understand that that

416
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,700
she's also working on a new law that

417
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,909
will give chava companies the privilege

418
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,410
to buy raw inputs cannabis inputs from

419
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:10,929
state license recreational cannabis

420
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:13,000
producers that follow-up will pretty

421
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:16,259
much remake the health and beauty aids

422
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,940
market how is that new log in to work ah

423
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:22,000
well let me just set the premise of why

424
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:25,600
it's necessary on of course on July

425
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,240
fifteenth of two of 2016 not only did I

426
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,690
lose my medical retail marketplace my

427
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,370
buyers but I also lost the collective

428
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,530
garden model system which is what

429
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:39,039
medical worked under here as far as

430
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:41,740
growers were concerned so I lost my

431
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:44,019
sourcing as well so I lost my way to

432
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,090
acquire cannabinoids because I don't

433
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:49,600
grow I'm not a I'm not a marijuana

434
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:52,120
grower and so what we really need is a

435
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,610
way we need it we needed an

436
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,360
accessibility vent to be able to work

437
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,340
with 50 to producers and so that's what

438
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,830
we're working on now we have a piece of

439
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,900
legislation in both the House and the

440
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:08,620
Senate right now that is on pause until

441
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,269
next year for four reasons that we just

442
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,839
thought the climate wasn't quite ready

443
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:16,629
for considering the new president and

444
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:19,959
and the federal climate that's all I'll

445
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,490
say about that so but when it goes next

446
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,710
session in January we'll be moving

447
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:27,069
forward with a piece of legislation that

448
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:29,680
will allow me to source that allow chava

449
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,119
permitted manufacturers and they will be

450
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,250
permitted through the liquor current and

451
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,479
cannabis board they'll have a permit

452
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,359
that will allow them to take

453
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,519
cannabinoids out of the 502 system and

454
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,859
make their products as long as the

455
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,960
products finish is less than point three

456
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:47,719
percent THC so it'll allow for the

457
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:50,029
handling of cannabinoids so the

458
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,400
the kind of impact of all the fantastic

459
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,019
work that you've been doing and kind of

460
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,659
where I want to go with the show today

461
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:59,509
is that you are doing this you know

462
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:02,390
nationally breakthrough work here in

463
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:06,019
Washington but as far as you know the US

464
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,600
as a whole this can become a model and

465
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,759
so you know how are these two laws a

466
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,788
model for similar work that could be

467
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:18,379
done by other entrepreneur activists in

468
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:21,529
other states yeah I love that so so my

469
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,630
number one goal is to get the hands that

470
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:25,158
get these types of products in the hand

471
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,929
back in the hands of all health

472
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,730
conscious consumers remember the

473
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:31,490
products that I make were they were

474
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,500
fairly commonplace 150 years ago so

475
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,720
let's we didn't read we didn't invent

476
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,349
anything we just defined it here with

477
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,509
our law and so but as far as other

478
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:44,928
states using what we've done here in

479
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:46,970
Washington State I think that it would

480
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:48,140
be fairly easy for them to do they could

481
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,019
just look at their Controlled Substances

482
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,600
Act and figure out a way to define these

483
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:54,829
types of products and remove it out of

484
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,869
their own States Controlled Substances

485
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:59,089
Act but they also have to figure out a

486
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:03,259
way for them to work with their own

487
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:04,519
medical or adult use regulated system I

488
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:07,759
mean you gotta remember in some states

489
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,650
don't have either yeah so it's going to

490
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,210
really depend on what is exactly

491
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,038
happening in that state I've had people

492
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,740
from Colorado in California both reach

493
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,558
out to me and asked me to do what we did

494
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,569
you know in their states what we did

495
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,700
here in Washington and it's not it's

496
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:25,189
easier said than done because you have

497
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,740
to look at the laws that are in place in

498
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,769
in those states and then tweak it from

499
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,538
there so but I encourage anybody that

500
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,460
wants to try to look at that to make

501
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:36,798
that happen because it will be state by

502
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,600
state by state unless of course they

503
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,650
just federally do scheduled marijuana

504
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:44,899
altogether but yeah it's exciting but as

505
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:47,809
you know that being said I am proud of

506
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,179
the fact that Washington State will be

507
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:51,980
known as the birthplace and epicenter of

508
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,900
cannabis modern-day cannabis health and

509
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,120
beauty aids so one of the things that I

510
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,600
know just from being friends with you is

511
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:01,599
that you are a

512
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:03,369
you're constantly working you are you

513
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,709
love doing strategic alliances with

514
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,899
other good people and and you've got

515
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,269
you've got this work ethic which is just

516
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,700
you know intense it's very intense and

517
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:14,980
and so you know I know that there are

518
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,450
other folks that are listening and our

519
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,700
understanding what you're putting down

520
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,769
about cannabis health and beauty aids

521
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,710
and you're like you know I might be able

522
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:26,529
to do in in my state what I did in

523
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,029
Washington what piece of advice or what

524
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:29,649
would you say to them if they came up to

525
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:32,440
you at a convention and said you know I

526
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,419
want to do this in you know in another

527
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,880
state what kind of advice do you give to

528
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:39,250
those folks so are you asking whether

529
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,929
they for them to change the law for them

530
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,970
to start making products like these

531
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:44,740
let's say let's say well probably the

532
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,900
changing the law I'm thinking of the

533
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,819
entrepreneur activist that's in a state

534
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,950
that at the very least has medical and

535
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:53,408
maybe they've got wreck but but they're

536
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,860
seeing this new opportunity and they

537
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:59,940
just want any words of advice sure well

538
00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:04,119
it's not for the faint of heart however

539
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,529
it could be easier than it seems I you

540
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,569
know first of all you want to make a

541
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:10,149
relationship with your legislator so you

542
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:12,038
need to know who your senator is and who

543
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,960
you're too house of representatives are

544
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:18,490
those people are your champions and once

545
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,409
they're just people it seems a little

546
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:24,579
intimidating but once you have those

547
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:26,470
people's ear there it's their job I mean

548
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:29,678
it is really their job to listen to you

549
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:32,230
and their job to try to help you to

550
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,169
manifest especially new industry

551
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:39,538
remember this disc is new industry and

552
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:42,580
this will it won't generate an adult

553
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:44,200
marijuana tax it only generates a

554
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:46,509
regular sales tax but it's still

555
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,970
business for the state so anytime it has

556
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:51,429
a monetary value to it that you've got

557
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,919
their ear just a little bit more but it

558
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:55,720
really is just about having you know it

559
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,429
exactly what you want to do and aligning

560
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,140
yourself with somebody that you know if

561
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:02,820
it's not you that writes the legislation

562
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:05,470
then you know get a untouched with a

563
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,389
legislator tell them what you need and

564
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,980
then sometimes they have will write the

565
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,169
legislation for you you don't always

566
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,370
have to write it like they have Senate

567
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,410
lawyer

568
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:16,058
you know writers that tweak all this

569
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,040
legislation and get it into the actual

570
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:19,869
language you know the law language

571
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,058
should get it through but they will help

572
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:24,969
you along the way it's about literally

573
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:26,558
making those phone calls and setting up

574
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,110
those appointments and getting the air

575
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,629
of your legislators so yeah it's not

576
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:34,000
necessarily glamorous all the time

577
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,460
there's a lot of detail work and tasks

578
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,049
know and what I did you know I have to

579
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,519
say that I think one of the things that

580
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:41,980
we did that was really smart I took my

581
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,599
son I took my 15 year olds out of school

582
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,210
and I'm proud to talk about this because

583
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,759
it gave him such a civic lesson to be

584
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,650
down there with me we went down and we

585
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,869
dropped off to the paint two of the

586
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,759
products in every single office that's a

587
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:58,178
hundred and forty eight offices in

588
00:22:54,759 --> 00:23:00,339
Olympia we made sure that when they had

589
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:02,290
to choose you know when they were making

590
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,970
the decisions on this cha the law that

591
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:05,678
was in front of him they knew what it

592
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,110
looked like they knew what it smelled

593
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,900
like they knew what it felt like and so

594
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:13,269
it was an education campaign down there

595
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,130
but that was just time and a little bit

596
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:17,500
of money you know it really wasn't that

597
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,380
costly it took us two days although the

598
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,269
the Capitol security stopped us in the

599
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,130
middle of our effort because they

600
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:27,609
thought that it was illegal for us to be

601
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,690
giving our products away and yeah and so

602
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:30,369
we had to reach out and get

603
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,320
clarification and they said come on back

604
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:34,629
down I mean they literally said shut us

605
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,428
down for a day and then went to their

606
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,190
lawyers and got back to us and said okay

607
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:41,920
it's okay for you to come back so yeah

608
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,600
so it's easy right on so so along those

609
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,150
similar lines you know I know that the

610
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,849
FDA watches the health and beauty aids

611
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,650
market really closely and I imagine that

612
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:52,419
must be sticky for you are you allowed

613
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:56,559
to claim any health benefits from

614
00:23:52,420 --> 00:24:00,730
Canada's on the packaging no absolutely

615
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:05,079
not so so I am so I'm not a supplement

616
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:06,250
and I'm not an herbal remedy so I mean

617
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,740
that's a kind of a different category

618
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,679
than a topical application so there's a

619
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,990
little less scrutiny on topical

620
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,179
applications but you can't as far as the

621
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,308
FDA concern you can't make any claims

622
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:20,019
that aren't substantiated by science

623
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:22,240
that aren't readily sanchi aided by

624
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:25,000
science and the fact of the matter is

625
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,839
there you know worse because of the fear

626
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,700
that's been around

627
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,829
this for all these years we're not quite

628
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,090
there as far as yes there's more and

629
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:32,439
more research all the time I don't want

630
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:34,839
to say that there's no research out

631
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,990
there but as far as for claims on my

632
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,599
actual labels I don't make any claims my

633
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:44,169
labels have to be FDA compliant because

634
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:46,028
I am what I am you know I would have to

635
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:48,038
be super super careful I don't even make

636
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:50,710
any claims about the arnica in my

637
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:53,890
products which I could I'm just being

638
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,380
ultra safe and so it basically says the

639
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,850
FDA doesn't support any claims but we

640
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,409
encourage you right on the label it says

641
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:03,038
we encourage you to do your own research

642
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:04,570
on our ingredient list so I've got I've

643
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:05,798
got a similar question but I want to I

644
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:08,710
want to change it up a little bit

645
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:11,200
because for folks who haven't let's

646
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,929
figure this out yet the the chava the

647
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,759
cannabis health and beauty aids are sold

648
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,038
epithet that part of your line are sold

649
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,558
in Washington because Washington has the

650
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:24,669
chava law that you got past but then you

651
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:27,460
also have a second half of your product

652
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:29,740
line which is all made with hemp seed

653
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,288
oil and you know hemp seed oil has been

654
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,819
around for decades are you allowed to

655
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:38,038
speak about the health benefits of that

656
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:40,538
even sure oh yes I am yeah I can

657
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,190
anything that's substantiated hemp oil

658
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:44,769
is you know if the rich in essential

659
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:48,308
fatty acids is rich in vitamin E vitamin

660
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:49,929
C vitamin B got key amino acids I mean

661
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:52,690
it's amazing for our skin and we've

662
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:54,610
we've been able to input we can't grow

663
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:57,519
in many states still and you know that's

664
00:25:54,609 --> 00:26:01,000
a whole nother hour show um but I've

665
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:03,099
been importing him seed oil since 1994

666
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,579
and I've been buying it organic hemp

667
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:10,509
seed oil from Canada since 1999 and you

668
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:13,089
know it's widely widely used in the

669
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:15,129
United States now and just for for good

670
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:17,259
reason I mean it's you know it's the

671
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:20,799
closest to our own natural semen it is

672
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:24,460
sebum it is the best oil for skin care

673
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:26,710
for for humans so for other folks like I

674
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,409
who don't know what sebum is what is

675
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,870
sebum it's just our own natural oil

676
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:33,820
production oh so like the oil that I

677
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:36,819
feel on my skin that's that's called

678
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:37,849
sebum yes folk and so if see it's also

679
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:39,769
got waxes

680
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:41,569
there's you know it's it's a little more

681
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:43,788
than just what you think of as oil it's

682
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:44,899
got the natural lipids very good very

683
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:46,759
good so we're going to take another

684
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,380
short break and be right back you are

685
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,599
listening to shaping fire and my guest

686
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,539
today is all warner founder of cannabis

687
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:55,730
basics as a business owner you are

688
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:57,319
incredibly busy in reality you are

689
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,990
responsible for everything your company

690
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:02,058
does you have so many responsibilities

691
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,890
every single day that often you just

692
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:06,558
don't have the time to really dig into

693
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,179
something as deeply as you'd like you

694
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,099
know there is more that you could do to

695
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:11,690
reach out to new customers and to

696
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:13,609
encourage loyalty and the customers you

697
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,409
already have but you certainly don't

698
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:17,000
have the time and you're not ready to

699
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:20,150
hire someone full time for that role

700
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,849
either for you i recommend blunt

701

focused on improving your bottom line

704
00:27:27,288 --> 00:27:31,940
you know most marketing firms are

705
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,158
excited to make your logo packaging and

706
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,990
website very pretty but they leave

707
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,360
responsibility for improving your bottom

708
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,759
line up to you they don't want that kind

709
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:42,349
of responsibility but that is pretty

710
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:45,470
much the most important part of

711
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:48,079
marketing right Kirsten and Anthony will

712
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:50,120
help you engage new customers funnel

713
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,949
them to your point of sale and keep them

714
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,529
coming back to you and telling their

715
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:56,390
friends no doubt this is a paid

716
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:58,639
commercial spots but that does not mean

717
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,860
they bought my opinion I've worked with

718
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,200
blood branding on three projects now for

719
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:04,399
various clients and every single time

720
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,970
they have done more than they have

721
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,620
promised and over delivered on results I

722
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:12,169
love how they generate new revenue and

723
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:14,928
focus on that as the goal instead of

724
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:17,059
just making me a pretty logo similarly

725
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:18,890
every friend I've referred them to has

726
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:21,319
come back to thank me and that just does

727
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,730

back this is shaping fire and i am your

743
00:28:56,538 --> 00:29:01,579
host Shango lowes today's guest is AA

744
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,750
warner founder of cannabis basics so the

745
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:04,428
first two sets we've been talking a

746
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,308
whole lot about the different kinds of

747
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:09,048
topicals and the changing of the law in

748
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:11,029
Washington and how that could be applied

749
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:14,538
across the country but I got to say that

750
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:17,990
every time I talk to a consumer or a

751
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:20,179
patient about cannabis topicals they all

752
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,370
want to know if it will cause them to

753
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:24,590
fail a drug test and since you do so

754
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:26,389
much rd and are so deep in the science I

755
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:30,109
think you are probably the best person

756
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:31,580
to ask so I will using a THC cannabis

757
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:34,849
topical cause someone to fail a drug

758
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:36,918
test well I think that there are

759
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:38,658
definitely people smarter than I as far

760
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:40,190
as this particular topic is concerned

761
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:43,250
but the fact of the matter is we

762
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,779
actually don't know yet I can tell you

763
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,779
this this is this is what I know

764
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:49,579
personally my next-door neighbor she

765
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:51,048
never has never smoked pot in her life I

766
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,970
gave her my strongest products it's

767
00:29:51,048 --> 00:29:55,250
about 10 milligrams per 1 ounce serving

768
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:58,460
so it's not a it's well under the point

769
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:01,099
three percent THC we tested her 15 mils

770
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,319
for 30 days and gave her you a and it

771
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:06,918
came up negative so we doubled the dose

772
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:09,619
30 with 15 mils the first 30 days and

773
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,299
then 30 mils the second 30 days tested

774
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:15,889
her again and again it came up negative

775
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:19,548
and so so I would say that probably not

776
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:21,679
but if before 44 chava highly

777
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:24,319
concentrated topicals I think that it is

778
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,538
a possibility that it might but I don't

779
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,490
know that for sure but I think that if

780
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:31,548
you are somebody who has a job with NASA

781
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:34,970
or you know you're going to lose you

782
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:37,668
know your your job over a tripped up QA

783
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,470
that I would just not quite use them yet

784
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,538
just not until we get a little bit more

785
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,179
science about how it would actually

786
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:47,658
affect a UA and what that level is for

787
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:51,590
topical applications so when being used

788
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:54,200
topical topically how important is the

789
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:55,788
carrier of choice by the Prophet product

790
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,640
designer because you know I hear people

791
00:30:55,788 --> 00:31:00,529
debate oh we should use emu oil or oh no

792
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,650
you only need to use methanol or

793
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:05,720
eucalyptus or alcohol and and so so you

794
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:09,470
know if someone is true

795
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,049
using a topical only to treat on the top

796
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:14,150
of the dermo like for psoriasis or

797
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:16,129
eczema well that's fine but but if

798
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,780
you're using it for you know muscle

799
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,160
relief or anti-inflammation i would

800
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:22,220
think that you've got to break the derma

801
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:25,029
so what does it take to carry the

802
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:28,069
cannabinoids through the skin barrier

803
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:30,500
well there's people use differing things

804
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:34,669
and I think some more natural than other

805
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:37,910
you know DM DMSO is used for penetration

806
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:40,070
emu oil is used for penetration in my

807
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:43,370
products I like to go like supernatural

808
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:46,309
way hemp is a great carrier oil as well

809
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:48,589
as some of the terpenoids not only in

810
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:51,109
cannabis but Detroit's in other

811
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:54,230
essential oils like linen loool is a

812
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:57,379
great carrier for the absorption of the

813
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,630
rest of the formula so that's how I get

814
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,300
it to be absorbed but my products aren't

815
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:04,520
necessarily they're not they're not

816
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:07,369
designed to be transdermal but they do

817
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,220
have a fairly deep level of penetration

818
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:12,169
I do want to make one point though as

819
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,329
far as for if it will cross the

820
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,590
blood-brain barrier pretty much

821
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:17,750
everything crosses the blood-brain

822
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:19,970
barrier and this is why it doesn't cause

823
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,549
intoxication you know when we smell

824
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:24,829
lavender that'll in elul gets into the

825
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:28,990
oxygen across the blood-brain barrier

826
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:32,659
and so it travels that way but as far as

827
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:34,130
our products the reason why it doesn't

828
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,860
cause intoxication is because there's

829
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:40,010
not enough of a level of that activated

830
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:41,509
THC to cross the blood-brain barrier in

831
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:44,180
a high enough concentration to cause

832
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:45,920
intoxication so it's not true that

833
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,470
things don't cross the blood-brain

834
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,180
barrier it is it's important that we

835
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,980
know that everything does it just

836
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,410
doesn't cross in a level that would

837
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,390
cause intoxication it sounds to me like

838
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:59,269
there's actually a whole bunch of

839
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:02,540
misinformation out there on just this

840
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:04,819
little sub part because you know I've

841
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:07,069
certainly been in the in the presence of

842
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:09,259
someone who was selling a topical and

843
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:11,299
and you know a truck driver would say

844
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:14,730
you know can I use this for pain relief

845
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:17,519
in my on my you know arm muffled and

846
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:20,819
and be sure i'm going to pass my my

847
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,129
urine analysis analysis at work and it

848
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:24,450
would seem that 22 real get your muscle

849
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,549
relaxation you're gonna have to break

850
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,519
through the derma and if that's the case

851
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:31,859
we actually don't know if they could

852
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,298
fail a drug test because the the science

853
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:36,089
hasn't been done the testing I actually

854
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:38,129
I don't think we know yet Shango I mean

855
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:39,959
there may be somebody that knows but I

856
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,400
had that information hasn't gotten to me

857
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,190
and I would certainly love to hear about

858
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,830
it if anybody has scientific evidence to

859
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,390
show one way or the other yeah people

860
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:53,189
people certainly have a lot of strong

861
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:54,870
opinions but I haven't oh yes yes well

862
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,090
the thing to think about it we barely

863
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:59,250
have any research at all on cannabis so

864
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:01,349
the topical application of cannabis is

865
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,298
going to be one of the last things that

866
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:05,069
really people put money behind to

867
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:07,168
research and I'm doing hoping to be

868
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:10,559
doing some you know some research on my

869
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:13,260
own but there's just so much to study so

870
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,820
so hopefully yeah well we got we got

871
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,060
money and slacks we got to start

872
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,760
somewhere yeah so so so uh you know I

873
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:22,619
can't help but imagine that women led

874
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,540
companies are just going to crush this

875
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:27,450
new Java market niche that you've

876
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:30,719
created you know women already lead much

877
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:33,388
of both the Hava industry as it is now

878
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,000
and also the newly forming cannabis

879
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,950
industry and now and now when you when

880
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,679
you put those together into cannabis

881
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:43,289
topical companies it just seems like

882
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,320
it's there's a lot of opportunity for

883
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:50,219
women in both sides of industry to work

884
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,200
together yeah I think so I mean I'm not

885
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,549
opposed to working with anybody and you

886
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,638
know I dude I just want to throw out

887
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,960
some props you know a couple of the

888
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,180
stronger brands here in Washington are

889
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,358
actually run by men and there's a great

890
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:04,829
company in Colorado that's uh that's run

891
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,549
by an amazing guy who used to work for

892
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:10,079
aveda but the women seemed to baton and

893
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:15,150
I'll tell you my the female perspective

894
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:17,009
is that great manufacturers here Megan

895
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:20,430
Co screens love her that's my sister

896
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:23,280
doing a great job with Java but the

897
00:35:20,429 --> 00:35:26,549
great thing is also the buyers most of

898
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,170
those buyers tend to be female in these

899
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,900
grocery stores and

900
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,780
you know and there tend to be the people

901
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,630
that actually buy the products and give

902
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,190
them to their partners or you know what

903
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:40,108
i mean so it's not just about the

904
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,380
manufacturers it's about who is actually

905
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:44,639
buying these and who is you-know-who

906
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,619
who's going to really push the market

907
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,420
forward and in depth those buyers and

908
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:49,980
then down to the consumers the consumers

909
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,260
they're the ones spending the money the

910
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,900
women are what the I forget what the

911
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,089
statistic is but they spend sixty five

912
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,990
percent or something of the household

913
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:02,539
money so it will be female driven it you

914
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:05,729
know it's a lot roundabout way of

915
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:07,849
confirming that question I love it I

916
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:12,240
love the women in our community you know

917
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:14,099
it's an amazing camaraderie so you know

918
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,229
I know that a lot of what we've talked

919
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,059
about today has been about this

920
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,088
revolutionary law and how it could be a

921
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:24,150
model for other states but I also know

922
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:26,548
that you are an expert product developer

923
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,079
and you know and you're a mover and

924
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:29,789
shaker when it comes to your product

925
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,470
lines so so what's coming up for

926
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:33,929
cannabis basics what are you seeing the

927
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:36,209
future for your company well we're super

928
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:38,460
excited now that we we just got all our

929
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,500
new display boxes so we literally we

930
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,539
look seriously legit on a grocery store

931
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,489
shelf now so that's pretty exciting and

932
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:46,500
that you know the distribution company

933
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:48,568
is just getting ready to go full force

934
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,519
on that right now in the next six months

935
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:52,829
we're all about community outreach so

936
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,588
we're doing a lot of fairs and festivals

937
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:58,048
we're doing pride we're doing you know

938
00:36:55,588 --> 00:37:01,230
of course we respond sir hempfest every

939
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:02,818
year we're doing uncorked in kirkland

940
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:05,760
you know we're really just trying to get

941
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:07,798
out there and let the brand be seen by

942
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,990
people that aren't in the cannabis

943
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:13,739
community it's about the mainstreaming

944
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:18,029
of kent chava right now for us and then

945
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:20,429
as far as you know there's a fascinating

946
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,510
new you know four years ago when i was

947
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:23,308
thinking about these products i was

948
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,760
thinking about the whole avon and mary

949
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:28,380
kay kind of situation and you know I'm

950
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,599
not really crazy about the pyramid

951
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,369
markings marketing scheme but i have

952
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,720
found in the last couple weeks that

953
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:39,088
there's been a really huge influx of

954
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:41,519
retired aged women that still have a

955
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:41,909
business license and they're finding us

956
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,429
and

957
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:47,279
they want to be reps for my company and

958
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:51,538
I just had this vision of this army of

959
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,480
retired women having parties and selling

960
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:55,650
chava to you know and word of mouth we

961
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,650
all know that that's the best

962
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:01,260
advertising ever you know so that's a

963
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,480
brand new kind of marketplace that I

964
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,119
really wasn't focused on until just this

965
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,858
last couple months you know so as far as

966
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,579
selling the product it's you know

967
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:13,108
there's so many different avenues one of

968
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:16,530
the things about cannabis is that is

969
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:18,088
that it is so effective that mostly you

970
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,349
just have to tell focus folks is

971
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:22,380
available and they're suddenly

972
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:23,970
interested oh oh and it's cool that's

973
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,380
the other thing it's got a cool factor

974
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:27,058
not only is it helping people with their

975
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,280
aches and pains and skin issues and all

976
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,559
that good stuff but but these people

977
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,480
want to be connected to this hip thing

978
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:36,030
right now like we're all of a sudden

979
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,490
kind of trending you know so that's

980
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:40,530

981

985
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,139
a manufacturing facility and going to be

986
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:54,269
doing hemp research you know growing

987
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:55,889
hemp and processing hemp seed because

988
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:57,630
